0,"the determination of stellar ages provides numerous clues on the evolution of the milky may and its components . while the classical method for globular clusters relies on morphological features in the hertzsprung  russell - diagram ( hrd ) , for example an age - dependent turn - off ( to ) brightness , direct age determinations of individual stars is progressively becoming a feasible alternative . in this case 
 , the age is obtained from the position of the star on an evolutionary track . 
 typical examples for this method are eclipsing binary systems such as ai  phe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or @xmath0  aur ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , for which accurate masses and radii can be determined from the light - curves ( photometry and spectroscopy needed ) , and the stellar composition is either assumed or obtained from spectral analysis . in this case , the requirement that both components should have the same age provides an independent test for stellar evolution theory . 
 if the distance to a single star is known accurately ( e.g.  from hipparcos parallaxes ) and its composition , gravity and effective temperature can be determined spectroscopically , the same procedure can be applied as well . 
 for example , this method has recently been used for metal - poor stars by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to deduce the formation history of bulge , thick and thin disk , and halo of the milky way . in the future , 
 detached eclipsing binaries will hopefully be detected in globular clusters by massive photometric searches ( e.g.  in @xmath1  cen , @xcite and @xcite , and in m4 , @xcite ) and will then allow age determinations of individual cluster stars ( @xcite ) .    to be prepared for this case 
 , we provide a grid of evolutionary tracks for low - mass , metal - poor stars typical for pop  ii . 
 the grid not only extends over stellar mass ( from @xmath2 ) but also over composition , both in metallicity @xmath3 and helium content @xmath4 . 
 the latter parameter usually is kept at a fixed value ( typically 0.23 ) or coupled to @xmath3 via an assumption about the chemical evolution . due to the small absolute value of @xmath3 for pop  ii stars , 
 this is however an almost negligible effect . 
 according to it might be feasible to determine age _ and _ helium content of members of detached eclipsing binary systems and therefore calculations for different values of the initial helium abundance are necessary .    as a further effect microscopic diffusion has to be considered . 
 although it has become evident that it is operating in the sun ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , there are also arguments that diffusion may not be as efficient as calculated , as can be seen from the high abundance of @xmath5 still present in the photosphere of metal - poor low - mass stars ( @xcite ) . 
 therefore , calculations with and without diffusion have been performed to cover the whole possible range .    in sect . 
 2 we will summarize the main properties of our stellar evolution code and the calculations done . 
 after this , the results will be presented . 
 we make available tables with the full evolutionary properties of all cases calculated . 
 these can be used for isochrone calculations as well , if needed . 
 we avoid transformations into observed colours and magnitudes for several reasons : firstly , such transformations always involve a further source of uncertainty ( see @xcite for a discussion ) ; secondly , they can , if needed , easily be applied , since the tables contain all necessary data ; and finally , the data expected from the analysis of binary lightcurves and from spectroscopy will yield physical quantities , anyhow . to facilitate the derivation of the stellar age from given values of the global stellar properties , fitting formulae and the corresponding coefficients 
 will be supplied as well . in sect . 
 4 we will finally discuss the accuracy of such direct age determinations with special emphasis laid upon the comparison with other , independent work , because this will provide insight into the inherent systematic uncertainties of theoretical stellar evolution calculations . in the absence of suitable binary systems , we have applied our results to a few nearby single stars with known absolute parameters . 
 this will be presented in sect .  4 as well , before the conclusions close the paper . 
 we are using the garching stellar evolution code , which is a derivative of the original kippenhahn - code ( @xcite ) developed and improved over the years . 
 while new properties of the code have always been documented in the corresponding publications , we summarize them here again for completeness :    [ [ numerical - aspects ] ] numerical aspects : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the lagrangian spatial grid ( in relative mass @xmath6 ) adopts itself to structure changes . 
 its resolution is controlled by an algorithm ensuring that the partial differential equations are solved with a given accuracy ( @xcite ) . 
 since all composition changes are calculated between two models of two successive evolutionary ages , the evolution of temperature and density during this time - step has to be given at each grid - point . 
 we use a predictor  corrector scheme for this ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . 
 the assumption of constant @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be used as an alternative , but requires time - steps smaller by about a factor of 25 . 
 nuclear burning and particle transport processes ( convection and diffusion ) are calculated either simultaneously in a single iterative scheme with a generalized henyey - solver ( @xcite ) or separately in a burning  mixing 
 burning  sequence . in the latter case 
 , the network solves the linearized particle abundance equations in an implicit way . in both cases a number of time - steps , which are smaller than that between the two models and which are adopting to composition changes , are followed until the whole evolutionary time - step is covered .    [ 
 [ opacities ] ] opacities : + + + + + + + + + +    we use as the sources for the rosseland mean opacities the latest opal tables ( @xcite ) and the molecular opacities by . 
 both groups provided us ( rogers 1995 , private communication , and alexander , 1995 , private communication ) with tables for _ exactly the same compositions _ including the enhancement of @xmath9-elements ( see @xcite for details ) . 
 the tables , which have a common @xmath7-@xmath8-grid , can smoothly be merged and together with electron conduction opacities ( @xcite ) result in consistent tables for all stellar interior conditions encountered . 
 the interpolation within a single table is done by bi - rational two - dimensional splines ( @xcite ) , which contain a free parameter allowing the transition from standard cubic to near - linear interpolation . 
 this avoids unwanted spline oscillations but guarantees that the interpolant is always differentiable twice . 
 we then interpolate in a 3x3 cube in @xmath10@xmath3space to the grid - point s composition by two independent polynomial interpolations of degree 2 . 
 the cube of table compositions is chosen such that the central point is closest to the actual composition under consideration . 
 [ [ equation - of - state ] ] equation of state : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use , where possible , the opal equation of state ( @xcite ) with the interpolation procedures provided by the same authors along with the eos tables . for low densities and temperatures , 
 we use our traditional saha - type eos for a partially ionized plasma or approximations for a degenerate electron gas ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details ) . 
 however , we did not calculate models not being covered by the opal eos for the larger part . 
 this limits the mass range to @xmath11 . 
 [ [ convection ] ] convection : + + + + + + + + + + +    convection is treated in the standard mixing - length approach . 
 no overshooting or semi - convection is considered . 
 the mixing - length parameter is calibrated with a solar model calculated without diffusion ; the resulting value for the physical input employed here is 1.59 pressure scale heights . 
 note that it would be slightly different for solar models including diffusion . 
 convective mixing is either assumed to be instantaneous or treated as a fast diffusive process in the case that all processes affecting the chemical composition are treated simultaneously . 
 [ [ neutrino - emission ] ] neutrino emission : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    energy losses due to plasma processes are included according to for plasma - neutrinos and for photo- and pair - neutrinos . 
 [ [ nuclear - reactions ] ] nuclear reactions : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use the reaction rates and the salpeter formula for weak screening . the nuclear network follows the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . all other species in the @xmath21-chain and cno - cycles are assumed to be in equilibrium ( this is justified because it assumes only that @xmath22-decays are faster than @xmath23-captures ) . 
 the network can also treat later burning phases , but this is of no concern here because calculations were stopped at the onset of the core helium flash . 
 [ [ diffusion ] ] diffusion : + + + + + + + + + +    we consider the diffusion of hydrogen and helium . while our code also allows for metal diffusion , we ignored this here for reasons of cpu economy . 
 experience from solar models shows that the effect of metal diffusion on the interior evolution is only a fraction of that of h / he diffusion . 
 this is confirmed by test calculations in which metal diffusion was included ( see next section ) . 
 the various coefficients of the particle diffusion equations are calculated according to with the routine provided kindly by a.  thoul ( 1997 , private communication ) . 
 if diffusion is considered , it turned out to be both more accurate and numerically stable to treat diffusion and burning in a single numerical algorithm ( see above ) . 
 we have calculated two complete sets of models , one ( canonical ) without and one with particle diffusion ( denoted `` c '' and `` d '' ) . in each set 
 the following values of mass and composition were explored :            the metallicity range is that for typical globular clusters , but is not covering the most metal - rich ones like 47  tuc or m107 . the same enhancement of @xmath9-elements ( @xcite ) is always assumed and is the one for which we have the opacity tables available . 
 @xmath3 therefore denotes the total metallicity including the @xmath9-element enhancement in all cases . because @xmath9-element enhancement is typical for pop  ii stars , no calculation for solar metal ratios has been done . 
 we recall that for very low metallicities , the evolution depends primarily on the total metallicity ( @xcite ) and only slightly on the internal metal distribution . 
 this , however , becomes non - negligible at the upper end of our metallicity range . 
 for example , find that already at @xmath30 the turn - off of isochrones is about 0.05  mag brighter for models which include @xmath9-enhancment as compared to a solar - scaled mixture with identical @xmath3 . also , the rgb colour is bluer by @xmath31  0.05  mag . 
 it is not yet clear whether the amount of oxygen enhancement in metal - poor stars is independent of metallicity ( see @xcite for a recent result ) , or whether there are systematic variations of @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath28 $ ] ( see @xcite for unevolved metal - poor stars ) . in both cases , 
 the oxygen enhancement of our metal mixture ( @xmath32=0.5 $ ] ) is a good representation of the average enhancement in the metallicity range under consideration . 
 the same is true for the magnesium overabundance ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for the spread of abundances of other @xmath9-elements ) . 
 variations around the mean @xmath9-enhancement are a second - order effect , which could be considered only in modeling individual objects , provided the availability of appropriate opacity tables . 
 the helium values of our mixtures were chosen as to certainly cover the possible range , with the central value of @xmath33 being close to a primordial value of @xmath34 ( @xcite ) . 
 this value is somewhat higher than the traditionally assumed 0.23 , which , however is too low , even for the more generally accepted primordial value of @xmath35 ( @xcite ) . 
 different initial helium contents in the calculations allow save interpolation to any prefered value or to keep it as a free parameter . some additional mixtures were considered for specific mass values in order to be able to compare with published results ( see sect . 
 all calculations were started from homogeneous zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) models with vanishing gravothermal energies . 
 this implies adjustment of isotopes to their equilibrium values in the stellar core ; this period lasts for several @xmath36 years . the resulting small loop in the hrd 
 is omitted in all figures and tables and the ages reset to zero for the models with minimum gravothermal energy production . 
 this definition does not necessarily coincide with the minimum luminosity during the initial loop , which would be an alternative choice for the zams position . 
 for the lower masses our definition corresponds to ages of a few @xmath36  yrs , for the higher masses to about @xmath37  yrs or even less . 
 the evolution is followed up to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , when helium violently ignites in an off - center shell ( core helium flash ) . 
 no shell - shifting or other approximation is done on the rgb ; the full evolution is followed . 
 typically , the calculations need about 200 time - steps until core hydrogen exhaustion , another 300 until the onset of the first dredge - up , 700 to the end of it and a further 8000 to the tip of the rgb . 
 the spatial resolution of the models is such that on the main sequence of order 600 and on the rgb twice as many grid - points are needed . 
 we verified that increasing the number of grid - points and time - steps does not influence the relation between luminosity and age by more than a per cent . 
 we display in fig . 
 [ f:1 ] the evolution without diffusion ( `` c''-set ) of all masses for the case which is close to the centre of our 3x4 composition space , i.e.  for @xmath38 , and in fig . 
 [ f:2 ] the changes of the evolution due to variations of the composition for the case of the @xmath39 model . 
 the left panels show the hrd - tracks ( top : varying helium content ; bottom : varying metallicity ) and the right ones the evolutionary speed . 
 the well - known effects , such as a lower effective temperature for higher @xmath3 or lower @xmath4 or shorter main - sequence ( ms ) lifetimes for higher @xmath4 or lower @xmath3 , are recognizable . 
 the influence of diffusion both on the track in the hrd and on the evolutionary speed is displayed in fig . 
 [ f:3 ] for the same reference composition . for sake of clarity the evolution of only a few selected masses are shown . 
 the effects  for example , lower effective temperature and brightness during the main sequence  are as known from other investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ) . 
 ms - lifetimes get shorter due to the diffusion of helium into the center , which is effectively equivalent to a faster aging of the star . for given ms - luminosity , to - models with diffusion 
 can be younger by up to 1  gyr compared to those calculated canonically . 
 we recall that we include only h / he - diffusion in the grid of models of this paper . to verify that the additional metal diffusion has a negligible influence on the evolutionary tracks and in particular on lifetimes , we show in fig . 
 [ f:3a ] the comparison between models with h / he- and h / he / z - diffusion in the case of mixture @xmath40 . 
 we chose a higher metallicity than in the previous example because the depletion of the stellar envelopes in metals due to diffusion is expected to have a higher effect for higher initial metallicity . 
 as fig .  [ f:3a ] demonstrates , the age - luminosity relation is almost identical and the track in the hrd only slightly shifted to the blue because of the decrease in surface metallicty . after the turn - off , the deepening convective envelope is mixing back quickly the diffused elements such that the initial envelope composition is almost restored ( cf . 
 the tracks approach each other therefore during the subgiant evolution . 
 the surface metallicity drops to a minimum of 42% of the initial one for the @xmath41 model , which is good agreement with results by . 
 it would be desirable to have an analytical formula @xmath42 , which returns the age of a star for any given set of observed quantities . however , there is no simple analytical fit to the results of the evolutionary calculations and high - order fitting formulae are not practical . 
 we have attempted to provide fits which are a compromise between accuracy and simplicity and start with providing a fitting formula to obtain @xmath43 for each individual mass calculated . 
 this formula is @xmath44 } = a - \exp(-(\log(l / l_\odot)+b)\cdot c)\ ] ] and in general fits the evolutionary ages after the initial 100 - 200 myr with an accuracy of a few percent . 
 the coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on mass and composition 
 . tables  [ t : fitc ] and [ t : fitd ] contain the values of all of them for all cases . to illustrate the fit quality , both the fit and the relative fitting accuracy are shown for two selected cases in figs .

 ( 1 ) on mass . 
 globally , @xmath54 and @xmath55 appear to be reminiscent of a parabolic function , while @xmath56 is close to a linear one . however , individual coefficient values lie off the main trend , such that higher order fits are required . 
 we used the cubic polynomial @xmath57 ( and equivalent expressions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . 
 the individual coefficients still depend on @xmath4 and @xmath3 . 
 we found that with this approximation the coefficients could be modelled again with an accuracy of a few percent . 
 the coefficients @xmath58 are listed for both sets of calculations in tables  [ t : fitcm ] and [ t : fitdm ] .

 [ f:4 ] and [ f:5 ] ( dashed lines ) as well . 
 while in the former case the fit quality is not degraded , it is worse in the latter one , but the errors remain within 5% for most of the evolution ( see the thin dashed line ) , except for the very end of the main - sequence , where the luminosity of the more massive stars shows the complicated `` kink''-behaviour in the hrd , which can not be modelled by this fitting function . 
 it is not useful to continue with finding fitting functions in composition , because we have only a 3x4 composition space and such functions would require at least 3 parameters for each dimension . 
 further fitting would therefore only increase the total number of coefficients .

1,"in the last ten years , thanks to high precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements , more than 100 extrasolar planets have been found . 
 the most important observational campaigns up to now have focused on old solar type stars because such stars present all the characteristics ( small @xmath5 , high number of spectral lines , low activity ) to exploit the best potentialities of the rv technique . 
 the orbits of the extra - solar planets are strikingly different from those of our solar system : some of them have massive planets of extremely short orbital periods ( so called `` hot jupiters '' or `` pegasides '' ) , while others exhibit very high eccentricities . 
 these results have given a new strong impulse to the theoretical efforts to explain the formation and evolution of planetary systems . 
 however , even the most fundamental questions are still open . 
 how common are planetary systems ? 
 how do planets form ? by core accretion or by gravitational instability in the disk . where do they form ? 
 close - in jupiter mass planets can form in situ , or do they have to form at a certain distance and then migrate inward ? 
 new insights should come from the determination of the orbital parameters for planets in early evolutionary phases . according to some scenarios the frequency of planets 
 was initially much higher than is observed in old stars , as a substantial fraction of the planets might have been either ejected from the system , or have been engulfed in the host stars . since capture of planets is highly unlikely , the frequency of planets of young stars ought to be higher than that of old stars . 
 the aim of this survey is to find out by how much . 
 another issue we could address concerns the evolution of the orbital parameters . in particular it would be important to know whether close - in planets have round orbits when they form or eccentric orbits , which then get circularised by tidal interaction with the host star .    there is an additional reasons for searching for planets of young stars . as pointed out by sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny ( 2003 ) even old exo - planets orbiting a solar - like star at 0.1 au would have a temperature of up to 900  k , because they are heated by the star . a massive , isolated planet with an age between @xmath6 to @xmath7 
 yrs would also have a temperature of more than 800  k but this time because it is still contracting . for close - in young planets both effects would add up resulting in objects of spectral type early l or even late m , which would be only 5 to 7 mag fainter than the host star . 
 the direct detection of these objects , especially in the infrared light , would be possible by means of interferometric observations as well as tracking down spectral signatures , giving access to fundamental parameters like temperature , radius and true masses . 
 the presence of spots and/or plages in the photosphere of active stars changes the profile of spectral lines causing fictitious variations in the rv measurements ( the so - called jitter ) . 
 not only this source of noise can mask the periodical variations which are the characteristic signature of the presence of a planet , but what makes it even worse is the fact that the presence of spots combined with the stellar rotation can itself introduce spurious periodicities in the radial velocity signal.this explains why young stars , which are supposed to be active , have so far been excluded from the major rv surveys for planets detection . 
 however paulson et al . ( 2002 ) monitored 82 stars in the hyades ( age @xmath8 700 myr ) finding a significant correlation between simultaneous rv and @xmath9 for only 5 stars . indeed exactly 
 to what extent the stellar activity can hinder the detection of exoplanets in rv measurement has not yet clearly assessed . 
 weighing pros and cons we finally decided to undertake a rv survey of young stars . 
 observations began in 2001 . 
 we monitored a sample of 46 young , nearby dwarf stars of late spectral type and took 1500 spectra of these up to now . 
 the observations have been carried out at the state observatory of turingia ( tls ) using the 2 m `` alfred jensch '' telescope which is equipped with a coud echelle spectrograph . 
 we used the visual grism which cover the spectral region from 4660 to 7410 @xmath10 in 44 orders . with a slit width of 1.2 arcsec a resolution of @xmath11 
 is achieved . an iodine cell placed in front of the slit generates a very dense system of absorption lines superimposed onto the stellar spectrum , which provides a highly precise wavelength scale and at same time allows to measure the psf in situ over the spectrum . 
 radial velocities ( rv s ) are measured by means of a software package called radial developed at the university of texas and mcdonald observatory , based on the methods described in marcy & butler(1992 ) and valenti , butler & marcy(1995 ) . 
 the identification of bona - fide young post - t - tauri stars near the sun still is an open astrophysical issue ( jensen 2001 ) . 
 recently many nearby associations of young stars have been recognised : twa , @xmath12 pic , tucana - horologium , @xmath13 cha , ab dor ( zuckermann & song 2004 ) . for such coeval stellar groups statistics considerations help to achieve reliable estimations of the common age . 
 unfortunately all those associations are located in the southern hemisphere.thus in selecting the sample of stars to survey we did the hobson s choice and looked out for young field stars . 
 one of the best indicators of young age , especially for g and k stars , is the presence of the lithium lii@xmath146708 absorption line . 
 the convective envelope of these stars brings the lithium in contact with the stellar core where the temperature is high enough to cause its burning . as a consequence the lithium in the stellar atmospheres is progressively depleted . 
 the lithium abundances can thus be used as an age estimator . 
 fig.1 shows the lii@xmath146708 equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of the @xmath15 for the stars in our sample and , as a comparison , for the pleiades ( age @xmath16 myr ) . as can be seen for the stars of pleiades , the lii@xmath146708 ew scatters significantly for the same @xmath15 . 
 thus it is not possible determine the age for every single star in our sample precisely . 
 rather , in a schematic way , we can subdivide our sample in two groups , one having ages comparable to the pleiades and the other consisting of older stars . 
 in fact , many stars in the latter group have been recognised as members of the ursa major association which is 300 myr old ( soderblom & major 1993 ) ( 500 myr according to king & schuler 2005 ) .    based on the hipparcos 
 parallaxes all our stars are at a distance of less than 50 pc from the sun , and 36 of them are closer than 30 pc . 
 accordingly , they are relatively bright , ranging from the fifth to the ninth visual magnitude . 
 fig.2 ( left panel ) shows the average internal errors @xmath17 in the rv s as a function of the projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath5 . 
 as expected for rapidly rotating stars , the spectral lines broadening makes it difficult to achieve high precision rv values . 
 however , up to a @xmath18 km / s , we routinely get internal errors of 10 to 15 m / s . 
 apart from the fact that the rv s for rapidly rotating stars are more difficult to determine , these stars are also more active . in order to demonstrate this , we consider the @xmath19 which is defined as the square - root of the difference between the standard deviation of the observed rv s ( @xmath20 ) and the @xmath17 squared . 
 @xmath19 thus is a measure of the rv - variations presumably due to stellar activity . 
 2 ( right ) shows @xmath19 against @xmath5 . 
 it can clearly be seen that stars of larger @xmath5 also show larger @xmath19-values . on the other hand the majority of stars in our sample which 
 have @xmath18 km / s show a @xmath19 lower than 35 m / s . 
 such a level of ` noise ' in the rv - measurements , even if larger than typical values for old dwarf stars of the same spectral type ( santos et al . 
 2000 ) , still allows the detection of a rv - signal of most of the known exo - planets . 
 for instance , a planet with @xmath0 = 1 @xmath2 in a circular orbit around a 1 @xmath21 star with a period @xmath22 days induces a stellar wobble with a rv semi - amplitude of @xmath23 m / s which is larger than the scatter caused by activity for a star with a @xmath18 km / s .      in order to derive upper limits for the detection of planets in our sample 
 , we carried out simulations . 
 for each point on a grid of values of the orbital period @xmath3 and the planetary mass @xmath24 , assuming for the star a mass on the basis of its spectral type , we generate a sinusoidal rv curve . 
 the curve is then sampled in the same way as the real data for that star , obtaining a set of simulated rv values.in the next step , we add noise of normal distribution to the data . 
 the noise is scaled so that the @xmath25 of the simulated data is equal to the observed @xmath20 . the whole procedure is repeated 5000 times , varying the phases randomly . for 
 each of the 5000 simulated data - sets we then derive the value of the periodogram ( @xmath26 ) for that period @xmath3 ( scargle 1982 ) and thus obtain for a given @xmath3 and @xmath0 a distribution of @xmath26 , which is compared to a similar distribution for @xmath27 . 
 if the two distributions do not overlap , we conclude that a planet of that @xmath3 and @xmath0 can be excluded . 
 similarly , from the overlap of the two distributions , we can calculate the probability for excluding such planet . 
 the results of our simulations for two opposite cases are shown in fig.3 . 
 quite remarkably in the best conditions ( panel @xmath28 ) we easily would have been able to detect a planet with @xmath29 for a period as large as 300 days . besides , even in the worst case ( panel @xmath30 ) 
 thanks to the high number of data points ( @xmath31 ) we are still sensible to very hot jupiter - mass planets .      in the whole sample 
 we have found only three objects which show a long period rv trend compatible with the presence of a stellar companion and one young planet candidate . 
 the rv data set for all these stars has been analysed in the same way : we calculated the scargle periodogram and in correspondence to the periods with higher peaks we estimate the weighted least squares best - fit orbital solution . 
 the phase - folded rv curve for our candidate planet is shown in fig.4 together with the best - fit orbital parameters . as we know that rv variations can also be induced by stellar activity , we analysed the hipparcos photometry and found a p=1.6477 days periodicity . 
 it is hence possible that the rv as well as the photometric variations originate from a @xmath8 1.5 days stellar rotational period . 
 however the star does not present enhanced x - ray luminosity and strong emission in the cores of the caii h and k lines , which are typical of fast rotators , and the @xmath32km / s would imply that we are observing the star almost pole - on . 
 further simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations will possibly confirm or discard the planet hypothesis .

2,"transition - metal oxides exhibit a rich variety of intriguing phenomena , including metal - to - insulator transitions@xcite , high - temperature superconductivity@xcite , colossal magnetoresistance@xcite , and colossal dielectric constants@xcite . 
 these properties are closely related to the strongly correlated nature of the localized @xmath0-orbital electrons . 
 the presence of electron correlations also render transition metal oxides very challenging to model from first principles . 
 one classic example of a correlated metal oxide is manganese oxide ( mno ) , which is of interest for several potential applications including solar energy conversion @xcite , photoelectrochemical water splitting @xcite , and as a magneto - piezoelectric semiconductor @xcite . 
 while the ground state of mno is rock salt ( rs ) , a few years ago metastable wurtzite ( wz ) was grown by thermal decomposition on a carbon template @xcite . 
 more recently , predictions of a reduced band gap and favorable hole transport properties in the wurtzite phase @xcite have been verified in experiment @xcite . 
 manganese oxide possesses a @xmath1 electronic structure , and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering of the mn atoms . 
 several recent first - principles studies have explored in detail the properties of two polymorphs of mno : rock salt ( rs ) and zincblende ( zb)@xcite . within the rs and zb polymorphs 
 , there is antiferromagnetic ordering along the [ 111 ] ( af2 ) and [ 001 ] ( af1 ) directions , respectively@xcite . although rock salt is the ground state structure , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and some hybrid functionals ( hse06 ) 
 erroneously predict that the zincblende structure is lower in energy@xcite . 
 the failure of conventional dft and even some hybrids to obtain the correct energetic ordering shows the importance of correlation in the phase stability of these materials . 
 the challenges in describing correlated materials within dft arise from its approximate treatment of electron correlation and exchange . 
 this is true whether one uses the local density approximation@xcite , the generalized gradient approximation@xcite , or a hybrid functional@xcite . 
 the accuracy and transferability of a given approximation across a spectrum of materials , or even for different polymorphs of the same material , must ultimately be justified _ a posteriori _ , by comparison to experiment .    by contrast , in this work we use fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc ) , a type of quantum monte carlo method , to assess the properties of the zincblende and the rock salt polymorphs of mno . 
 the reasons are twofold . 
 first , in quantum monte carlo , statistical sampling is used to approximate the many - body wave function and evaluate total energies directly from the first - principles many - body schrdinger equation , greatly reducing the extent of approximation necessary . 
 quantum monte carlo methods therefore offer a parameter - free , systematically improvable approach . because of their direct treatment of electron correlation , they are amongst the most accurate electronic structure approaches available today  @xcite . 
 second , although the fn - dmc method is in principle exact when the nodal structure is exactly known , there remain outstanding questions as to the practical accuracy of the technique . 
 it is important to test how well simple nodal surface do in practice . 
 this material system offers a test of the capabilities , using  best practices "" for dmc simulation of solids as they are currently understood , to obtain quantitative descriptions of challenging correlated oxide materials .    for mno , 
 our results show that the dmc method obtains accurate descriptions of the ground state of both the rs and zb phase , including their relative energies and lattice constants . 
 we find that the magnitude of the fixed node error for the ground state is small in comparison to the substantial improvement that comes from adopting an explicitly correlated approach . because dmc samples the true many - body wave function , 
 we analyze the properties of this highly accurate model to assess the physical reason for the failure of dft methods . 
 thus , the use of fn - dmc helps to reveal aspects , such as charge fluctuation and localization , that may not be accurately captured by other methods . in agreement with other theoretical methods 
 , we also find that the band gap of the zb phase is substantially lower than that of rs phase according to fn - dmc . 
 however , fn - dmc overestimates the band gaps of both polymorphs in comparison to experiment . 
 we discuss possible reasons for the overestimate .

 the qmc calculations reported here were carried out within the fn - dmc framework as implemented in the qwalk code  @xcite , with single - determinant slater - jastrow trial wave functions constructed from dft kohn - sham orbitals , with variance - minimized two - body jastrow coefficients , and a time step of 0.004 au . 
 we also assessed the sensitivity of the dmc energy to various forms of trial wave functions , such as two and three body jastrow factors and both energy and variance minimization to optimize the jastrow parameters . 
 however in all cases we find the dmc energies to be statistically equivalent . 
 this is similar to our observations for dmc simulations of the wide band gap material zinc oxide , also using small - core bfd pseudopotentials and a similar simulation strategy  @xcite . 
 ground state energies were determined by twist averaging the dmc energies calculated at real - valued @xmath2-points , which corresponds to a @xmath3 grid in each supercell . 
 scalar - relativistic energy - consistent hartree - fock pseudopotentials ( [ ne ] core for mn ) as implemented by burkatzki , filippi , and dolg ( bfd ) @xcite were used to remove the core electrons . 
 these pseudopotentials are designed for use within qmc and there are now several indications in the literature that they are well - suited for dmc simulations of solids@xcite . 
 the rock salt structure of mno has previously been studied within dmc@xcite ; to this analysis we now provide a comparison between the zb and rs polymorphs , physical insights into the electronic structure of the two phases , and statistical analysis of the many body wave functions to reveal the reasons for the failure of conventional and hybrid dft to obtain the correct energy ordering .    to obtain the trial wave functions for the dmc calculations 
 , we carried out dft simulations for the rs and zb phases . 
 for these simulations , we used the crystal code@xcite and gaussian - type localized basis sets to expand the kohn - sham orbitals . 
 the dft results presented here implement the 
 pbe1@xmath4 "" framework in which the degree of exact exchange mixing @xmath5 is systematically varied . 
 we do this to study the effect on both the dft results themselves as well as the the final dmc results arising from different selections of trial wave functions . 
 ( color online ) . 
 the energy difference @xmath6 according to dft - pbe1@xmath4 , obtained from all electron calculations ( orange ) and with burkatski - filipi - dolg ( hartree - fock ) pseudopotentials ( blue ) . according to all electron results , for @xmath7 the zb phase is lower in energy but as @xmath5 increases the rs phase becomes stable . 
 the crossing occurs around @xmath8% . when burkatski - filipi - dolg pseudopotentials are used , the trends are very similar . 
 , width=321 ]        to begin , we construct a set of trial wave functions for the dmc calculations using the dft - pbe1@xmath4 approach , in which the degree of exchange mixing @xmath5 is varied between 0 and 60% . in figure 
 [ energyvalpha ] , we illustrate the ground state energy difference @xmath9 per formula unit mno , as a function of the degree of exchange mixing used in the dft - pbe1@xmath4 calculations . for comparison , we also show all electron results as well . 
 it is encouraging that the two sets of results are quite similar , which suggests that the relativistic hartree - fock pseudopotentials are not affecting the analysis substantially . 
 for these calculations , 4 atom unit cells were used for both rs and zb in conjunction with an @xmath10 monkhorst - pack sampling of @xmath2-points in the brillouin zone . 
 the rs lattice constant was set to 4.43  , matching experiment@xcite , while the zb lattice constant was set to the pbe0 lattice constant of 4.73  since the experimental value is not known . 
 positive values of @xmath9 in fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] denote more stable rock salt phase . 
 consistent with previous results@xcite , we find that without exchange mixing ( @xmath7% , pbe ) the zb phase is more stable ( by @xmath11 70 mev / fu in our case , both for all electron and bfd pseudopotentials . as the degree of exchange mixing is increased , the rs phase becomes more favored . 
 for instance , for @xmath12% rs has become more stable by @xmath11 250 ( bfd ) or 300 ( all electron ) mev / fu . the cross - over occurs around an exchange mixing of @xmath13% . 
 we note the wide variability of relative dft energy differences predicted for different selections of @xmath5 in figure [ energyvalpha ] . for oxides and wide gap semiconductors , although the empirical choice @xmath14% in hybrid calculations is motivated from perturbation theory@xcite and appears to be quite reasonable in many instances , sometimes tuning of the parameter is required@xcite . 
 this sensitivity to simulation parameters renders true quantitative predictions of energy ordering and phase stability challenging within the hybrid dft framework .    regarding the energy differences shown in fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] , our results are consistent with previous results in which several dft functionals including the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof screened exchange hybrid functional ( incorrectly ) find zb to be more stable than rs @xcite . 
 for instance , using hse06 , the energy difference @xmath6 is reported to be -28 mev / fu@xcite . 
 there are some cautionary notes to be aware of when comparing our results in fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] to others , however . 
 we are using bfd ( hartree - fock ) rather than dft pseudopotentials since our primary interest is to generate the best possible qmc description , and not to carry out a dft study _ per se_. the more localized treatment of the core within hartree - fock influences dft results reported here . 
 also , the lattice constants are fixed to generate the results of fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] , rather than optimized separately for each value of @xmath5 considered . 
 this affects the precise energy differences as well as the  cross - over "" value of @xmath5 . 
 qualitatively , however , figure [ energyvalpha ] shows the expected behavior that is consistent with previous results@xcite for this system , and the bfd results appear to be a good starting point for dmc analysis . 
 ( color online ) . 
 the total absolute spin on the manganese atoms increases with increasing exchange weight @xmath5 . 
 the spin on the zb phase is always lower than that of the rs phase.,width=321 ]    to better understand the dft trends in fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] , in fig . 
 [ pods ] we show the density of states for both phases for different selections of @xmath5 . 
 the black lines are the total dos , while blue and red respectively indicate states with o @xmath15,@xmath16 and mn @xmath17 character . 
 the first trend , as expected , is that increasing @xmath5 widens the band gap in all cases . 
 in addition , @xmath5 also has an effect on the relative position of the o @xmath16 and mn @xmath17 orbitals below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) . 
 for both phases , for @xmath18 there are two distinct groups of states : one near the vbm dominated by mn @xmath17 orbitals , and another lower in energy dominated by o @xmath16 orbitals . as @xmath5 increases , the mixing between these sets of orbitals below the vbm increases and the two groups begin to merge ; @xmath5 is essentially a tuning parameter that governs the degree of @xmath19-@xmath0 hybridization in the materials . _ a priori _ it is not possible to know which degree of hybridization best captures reality ( nor do we expect that sweeping through @xmath5 will span all possibilities ) . 
 however , to first order increasing @xmath5 has the effect of canceling the self - interaction error that is present within dft . given the trends in fig . 
 [ energyvalpha ] , it appears that rs benefits more from this cancellation than zb ( _ i.e. _ , its energy decreases faster as @xmath5 increases ) . 
 crystal field theory provides a plausible explanation for why this may be the case . in rs 
 the octahedral field of o surrounding each mn splits the five degenerate @xmath17 orbitals into three lower energy @xmath20 and two higher energy @xmath21 orbitals . the @xmath20 orbitals are non - bonding , but the @xmath21 orbitals directly overlap and hybridize with the o ligands to form bonding @xmath21 and antibonding @xmath22 states ( see fig . 
 [ pods ] for rs for @xmath14% ) . for rs the direct orbital overlap results in a large hybridization and large crystal field splitting between the @xmath20 , @xmath21 levels . 
 by contrast , in the zb phase the tetrahedral coordination of the mn @xmath17 orbitals results in a splitting of the mn @xmath0 orbitals into two lower energy @xmath23 orbitals and three higher energy @xmath24 orbitals . 
 this time the @xmath23 orbitals are non - bonding while the @xmath24 orbitals interact with the o ligands ( see fig . [ pods ] for zb for @xmath14% ) . 
 the difference is that the @xmath24 orbitals are oriented in between the o orbitals , so the spatial overlap now is less direct . 
 although the interaction creates bonding and antibonding @xmath24 states , the resulting crystal field splitting @xmath23 , @xmath24 is smaller for zb . 
 we speculate that the direct overlap of orbitals for the rs phase , in contrast to the indirect overlap for zb , contributes to the difficulty of accurately modeling the rs phase . 
 greater overlap implies more electrons will occupy the same region in space , which can only be captured by a very good description of electron correlation and exchange . 
 the approximate description of electron correlation in dft may therefore more adversely affect rs mno than zb mno , causing its energy to be higher than it should be and resulting in the wrong energy ordering .      before proceeding to the dmc results 
 , we also show in fig . 
 [ spins ] the total absolute spin on each of the mn as a function of the exchange weight @xmath5 . for both phases , the total spin increases with increasing @xmath5 . 
 the effect of increasing @xmath5 diminishes over the domain as the spin approaches 5 , the total spin in the ionic limit of the high spin @xmath1 oxide . 
 furthermore , the total spin on the manganese atoms of zb is consistently less than those of rs , which is again related to its smaller crystal field splitting . 
 ( color online ) . the effect of varying the trial wave function in dmc using different dft - pbe1@xmath4 exchange weights @xmath5 on the dmc total energies for rs and zb ( error bars are smaller than the marker size ) . 
 both phases demonstrate a minimum energy around @xmath25 25% , and maintain similar relative energies over the domain.,width=321 ]     ( color online ) . 
 the dmc energies of the rs and zb phase ( ev / fu ) , relative to the extrapolated zero time step dmc energy of the zb phase , plotted as a function of timestep , for a 4 atom supercell . 
 the inset shows the energy difference @xmath6 ( ev / fu ) vs. time step . 
 , width=321 ]      for the dmc calculations , our first goal is to determine the trial wave function that gives the best description of each phase . figure [ dmcenergyvalpha ] shows the total dmc energies for both the rs ( red ) and zb ( blue ) phase as a function of the @xmath5 used to generate the trial wave function for a 4 atom unit cell . as 
 dmc is a variational technique , the @xmath5 that results in the lowest dmc energy gives the best representation of the true nodal surface . 
 thus , we can use @xmath5 to vary the nodes of the trial wave function . 
 although the exact nodal structure is not known , it is expected to sample a wide range since this parameter tunes an important physical quantity : the hybridization between oxygen and manganese .    for both rs and zb , a minimum in the dmc energy is observed around @xmath26 . 
 it is interesting to note that this is similar to several other transition metal oxides for which minima in dmc energy tend to occur in a range 15% @xmath27 35% including vo@xmath28  @xcite , feo@xcite , cacuo@xmath28@xcite , lacuo@xmath29@xcite , and zno@xcite . 
 we speculate that @xmath30% may tend to offer the best description of hybridization between the transition metal @xmath0 and the o @xmath16 orbitals , although we emphasize that this may not always be the case . for both phases 
 the overall variation of the total dmc energy is less than 0.15 ev / fu across the full range sampled here , indicating that variations in nodal structure can give rise to total energy differences of roughly this magnitude . 
 nevertheless , the exchange weight that offered the lowest ground state dmc energy within the 4 atom system was used for both polymorphs for all subsequent calculations . 
 this exchange weight was calculated by applying a bayesian quadratic fit@xcite to the data of fig . 
 [ dmcenergyvalpha ] from which a minimum was determined : @xmath31 for rock salt , and @xmath32 for zincblende .    from the parabolas in fig . 
 [ dmcenergyvalpha ] , it appears that when comparing _ energy differences _ between two structures , variations in the nodal structure benefit from a cancellation of errors . 
 the dmc energy differences ( space between the parabolas for a given @xmath5 ) are even less sensitive to changes in the nodal surface that arise from varying @xmath5 in the trial wave function . 
 the total variation in @xmath9 per fu across the full range of @xmath5 spanned is now only @xmath33 ev ( in spite of the 0.3 ev / fu variation exhibited by the dft starting point calculations ) . 
 we caution that since these dmc results are for 4 atom cells , they suffer from finite size effects and therefore the precise value @xmath9 is not meaningful ( we later carry out a full extrapolation of @xmath9 for increasing supercell size ) . 
 our focus here instead is on the sensitivity of @xmath9 to the trial wave function , which is quite small . 
 it is encouraging that dmc gives consistent results in spite of the large variability of the starting point .      in diffusion monte carlo , 
 a green s function approach is used to propagate a set of walkers in a 3@xmath34-dimensional space ( @xmath34 is the number of electrons ) , to statistically sample the many - body wave function . 
 the green s function projector is exact only in the limit of vanishingly small time step , but in practice implementation of dmc requires a finite time step , which introduces an error in the projected energy@xcite . 
 therefore , it is important to show that errors in the projected energy due to the finite time step are small , in comparison to the energies of interest . in fig . 
 [ timestep ] , we show the dmc energy for rs and zb ( 4-atom supercells , twist averaged ) as a function of the dmc time step , and the extrapolation of the energy to infinitesimal time step . for both phases the dependence of the energy on the time step shows a linear or near - linear dependence , which is expected for sufficiently small time steps . for time steps 
 smaller than 0.01 au , for each phase the energy varies within @xmath11 0.1 ev / fu of the extrapolated value . 
 most importantly , the inset of fig . 
 [ timestep ] shows the energy difference @xmath6 ( ev / fu ) vs. the dmc time step , which is the quantity which we are ultimately interested in resolving . 
 this figure shows that _ energy differences _ somewhat benefit from a cancellation of time step errors . 
 for instance , in the limit of zero time step the energy difference is 0.04(1 ) ev / fu . for a time step of 0.01 au , the computed energy difference instead is around 0.03(1 ) ev / fu , which indicates a time step error in the energy difference of @xmath11 0.01(1 ) ev / fu . for a time step of 0.004 au , the computed energy difference is within error bars of the extrapolated energy difference . for the remainder of this work 
 , we use a dmc time step of 0.004 a.u . 
 the uncertainty in @xmath6 arising from the time step error here is then less than 0.01 ev / fu , which ( as we will demonstrate later ) is smaller than the energy difference that we are trying to resolve . 
 ( color online ) . extrapolated values of lattice constants according to dmc for zb and rs mno are @xmath35  and @xmath36  respectively . 
 the rs value is within 1% of experiment 4.43 @xcite . 
 the experimental value for zb is unknown , but the dmc value matches the pbe0 value of @xmath37  . , width=321 ]    since energy differences due to using the wrong lattice constant can be significant when resolving small differences in total energies , it is necessary to find the optimal lattice constants for both phases within dmc itself . 
 finding lattice constants in dmc is complicated by the fact that dmc simulations of bulk solids themselves suffer from both one - body and many - body finite size effects . 
 the former are accomodated by twist - averaging , but the latter arise from a spurious correlation between image electrons in the computational domain which typically reduces the total energy@xcite . for large enough supercells , the energy variations scale as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the volume of the cell@xcite ( or @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of atoms in the supercell , since @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath39 ) .    using the optimal @xmath5 for each phase 
 , we evaluated the total dmc energy of the rs and the zb phase as a function of the lattice constant @xmath42 , for supercells of size 4 , 8 , and 16 atoms . 
 [ lattconsts ] shows the minimum @xmath42 obtained for each phase and supercell size . 
 we find that the optimal lattice constant is not the same for different sized supercells but that they increase with increasing supercell size . to our knowledge 
 , there are no studies of finite size effects on lattice constants within dmc , which would be an interesting avenue for further analysis . from the results in fig . 
 [ lattconsts ] , we speculate that many - body finite size effects bias towards smaller lattice constants . for small supercells , the calculated total energies are artificially low , dominated by the finite size effect . 
 the lattice constant is drawn towards smaller values , which further enhances the stabilizing influence of the spurious image electron correlation . as the supercell size increases , 
 the finite size effect is reduced and the lattice constants better reflects the true values .    in any case , extrapolating our results to the thermodynamic limit @xmath43 , the lattice constants for the zb and rs polymorphs of mno were determined to be @xmath44  and @xmath45  . while there is no experimental measurement for the zb structure , the lattice constant for the rs structure has been previously measured to be 4.43 @xcite , demonstrating that in this case our dmc approach can estimate lattice constants to within @xmath46 1% of experiment . for the zb phase the estimated lattice constant matches well the pbe0 value of @xmath37  obtained here . 
 [ cols= "" < "" , ]     to these results , we now add the the band gaps of the two phases as obtained from dmc using a procedure that has previously been used successfully @xcite . for both phases , 
 we calculate both the quasiparticle gap ( qp ) and the optical gap ( og ) . we obtain the quasiparticle gap by calculating the difference between the electron affinity ( ea ) and the ionization potential ( ip ) : @xmath47 here , @xmath41 denotes the number of electrons in the neutral solid , @xmath48 denotes addition of an electron , and @xmath49 denotes removal of an electron . 
 the trial wave functions for the dmc calculations to obtain @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in the expressions above are all built from dft kohn - sham orbitals obtained from charge neutral dft calculations . 
 for the case of @xmath50 ( or @xmath52 ) , dmc simulations of the charged system is carried out by adding an additional electron to the lowest unfilled orbital ( or removing an electron from the highest filled orbital ) . 
 strictly the qp gap should be calculated in the limit @xmath43 ; instead we use a 32 atom supercell . both rs and 
 zb exhibit an indirect gap , but due to zone folding for the 32 atom supercells the gap becomes direct @xmath53 in both cases . 
 thus we have calculated the qp gap according to eq . 
 ( [ qp ] ) by evaluating the energies at the @xmath54 point . 
 the optical gap is obtained as @xmath55 in this expression @xmath56 denotes the ground state energy and @xmath57 denotes the energy of the first optically excited state . 
 we estimate the energy difference by evaluating @xmath56 and @xmath58 at @xmath54 , and @xmath58 is calculated by promoting an electron from the highest occupied kohn - sham orbital at @xmath54 to the lowest unoccupied orbital in the construction of the slater determinant . for the og , 
 once again 32 atom supercells are used . for both phases , the op and the qp obtained in this manner 
 are close , within error bars of each other .    according to table [ comparisongaps ] , 
 compared to previously reported dft and gw values our dmc results are high ( but our gap for the rock salt phase is similar to kolorenc and mitas s previous dmc results@xcite ) . while dmc also predicts that zb has a lower gap by around 1 ev than rs 
 , the dmc gaps themselves appear to overestimate the experimental values by 0.5  1 ev . 
 we suggest several possible reasons for this . 
 the first is that finite size effects affect the calculated values . 
 a second possibility is that the trial wave functions generated for excited states may not be as good as those generated for the ground state . 
 if the nodal structure of the excited state wave function is more complex , then nodal errors will result in an overestimated gap . 
 in fact , we note that the case of mno is particularly challenging for dmc . according to the picture from zaanen , sawatsky , and allen @xcite , the @xmath17 transition metal oxides can be classified as either mott - hubbard insulators or charge transfer insulators , based on the degree of @xmath17 orbital filling . 
 the early @xmath17 elements form mott - hubbard insulators , for which the gap appears across states of @xmath0 orbital character ( upper and lower hubbard bands ) . 
 the late @xmath17 elements form charge transfer insulators , for which the gap appears across o @xmath16 and tm @xmath17 states . 
 the case of @xmath1 mno lies just at the transition , suggesting that the vbm has mixed @xmath59 character . 
 since the excited state calculation requires removing an electron from the vbm , the sensitivity to the trial wave function is expected to be particularly strong . 
 we suspect that obtaining a better description of the gap depends strongly on generating trial wave functions which more accurately capture the nature of the vbm . 
 in this work , we have utilized fn - dmc to elucidate the electronic properties and stability of the rs and zb polymorphs of mno . 
 we find that dmc predicts a ground state energy ordering of these two phases in agreement with experiment without the use of any parameters . 
 the energy ordering is insensitive to the choice of the trial wave function , even though different dft trial wave functions predict very different phase stabilities . 
 dmc lattice constants are also in good agreement with experiment . 
 analysis of the site resolved charge fluctuations illustrate some of the primary problems with conventional dft and show that hybrid functionals make improvements . 
 finally , we find that the dmc calculated band gaps indicate that the tetrahedrally coordinated phase has a lower gap , but that ( within our approach ) dmc overestimates the gap according to experiment . 
 we attribute this to the challenge of capturing proper description of @xmath59 hybridization in the trial wave functions used in the dmc calculations .

3,"underground and underwater detectors for neutrino astronomy require simulation tools capable to correctly handle the propagation of high energy muons up to @xmath2 energy region and above 
 . the new object - oriented ( c++ ) version of the detector simulation tool geant ( geant4 @xcite ) , will probably be suitable for this goal . 
 + however many experiments  @xcite still make use of geant3  @xcite to simulate the detector response . 
 even if such package can in principle perform the simulation of particle propagation above 10 @xmath3 , it has been mainly designed for accelerator experiments , whose tipical energy range does nt exceed the @xmath3 region . 
 + the simulation of muonic interactions is actually guaranteed by the authors for muon energy below 10 @xmath3 @xcite . 
 this is due to the parametrizations of cross sections for radiative processes contained in geant3 , which are reliable only for energy up to 10 @xmath3 . 
 moreover the description of photonuclear interaction is realized in a frame which significantly disagrees with theoretical calculations , for each muon energy . + our new simulation code ( gmu ) has been carried out to make the geant3 standard library reliable in reproducing uhe muons propagation through matter . 
 + gmu replaces the simulation of the radiative muonic interactions performed by geant3 , for each energy and for each material , keeping the same structure of the original program . 
 the procedure to apply the new code is completely transparent in such a way that no adjustments must be implemented in the programs that make use of the standard geant3 library . 
 high - energy muons propagating through matter mainly interact by quasi - continuous ( ionization ) and discrete ( bremsstrahlung , direct electron - positron pair production , photonuclear interaction ) energy losses mechanisms . 
 ionization dominates at energy lower than few hundreds of @xmath1 while above the @xmath3 region energy losses are mainly due to radiative processes . 
 + the radiative processes are simulated stocastically by geant3 above a fixed ( user supplied ) transferred energy threshold ; below this threshold they are treated as continuous . 
 the models which describe the interaction processes are the physical input for the code . in more detail , simulating a given process requires :    * to evaluate the probability of occurrence of the process by sampling the total cross section of the process * to generate the final state after interaction by sampling the differential cross section of the process    the reliability of the simulation is then affected both by the formulas ( and/or parametrizations ) chosen for cross sections and by the alghoritms used for sampling and for numerical integration . 
 + standard reference formulas for uhe calculations can be found in the paper by lohmann and voss  @xcite which also tabulate the average muon energy losses for many materials and compounds up to @xmath4 @xmath3 . + direct electron pair production differential cross section has been first calculated by kelner and kotov in the framework of qed theory @xcite . 
 we have used the well - known parametrization performed by kokoulin and petrukhin @xcite which considers the corrections for atomic and nuclear form factors . 
 + for bremsstrahlung differential cross section we have used the formula derived by andreev and bugaev @xcite which takes into account the structure of nuclear target ( elastic and inelastic form factors ) and the exact contributions due to atomic electrons ( screening effect and bremsstrahlung of the muons on electrons ) . 
 the formula used by lohmann and voss had been carried out just from this one by petrukhin and shestakov @xcite by neglecting bremsstrahlung on electrons and nuclear effects in light materials ( @xmath5 ) . 
 the discrepancy between the two approaches reaches few percents , in terms of bremsstrahlung energy losses , in the worse case ( for materials with @xmath6 ) and it is almost always negligible in the calculation of the total muon energy losses . + for the photonuclear interaction we have used the differential cross section calculated by bezrukov and bugaev @xcite within the vector meson dominance hypothesis . 
 we also have considered the recent accelerator data coming from zeus and h1 @xcite @xcite according to the ref . 
 for this process we have not considered , at present , the angle between the ingoing and outgoing muon , taking the reasonable approximation of completely forward scattering . as a consequence , 
 the code is not suitable for studies dedicated to muon - nucleus scattering at large angles . 
 + total cross section and average energy loss for each radiative process @xmath7 can be calculated , starting from differential cross sections , as follows : + @xmath8 @xmath9    * @xmath10 and @xmath11 are avogadro s number and the mass number respectively * @xmath12 is the fraction of initial energy @xmath13 lost by muon at the occurrence of the process @xmath7 * @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the kinematical limits for the allowed values of @xmath12 ( @xcite,@xcite ) * @xmath16 is the thickness of throughgone matter , expressed in @xmath17 * @xmath18 is the differential cross section for the process @xmath7 ( explicit formulas are given in the appendix )    the calculation of energy losses performed with the formulas described above agree with the lohmann and voss results at percent level in the energy range they considered ( @xmath19-@xmath20 . ) 
 + in fig . 
 [ cross ] we report the total cross sections for the radiative processes as they are tabulated at the initialization procedures by standard geant321 and by geant321 plus gmu . + in the first case the points are calculated with approximated analytical parametrizations whose accuracy is guaranteed ( at least for bremsstrahlung and pair production ) within @xmath21 in the declared energy range ( @xmath22 @xmath3 ) . + in the second case the points are calculated by performing numerical integration of the formulas given in the appendix . 
 ( this operation requires a small amount of cpu time at the initialization , depending also on the number of materials considered . ) + the photonuclear cross sections differ by more than one order of magnitude . this discrepancy has already been observed in previous works @xcite and it is expected to affect the total energy loss especially in the case of light materials . 
 the total cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production below 100 @xmath3 seem to be in excellent agreement but for energy above 100 @xmath3 the geant321 cross sections strongly deviate from expectation . 
 in order to evaluate the correctness of the simulation code we have performed some checks for different materials . for each test 
 run we have activated the full stochastical regime and we have evaluated the average energy loss resulting from the simulation . 
 the values achieved with standard geant321 and with geant321 plus gmu have been compared with numerical calculations of the same quantities [ see eq.([losses ] ) ] . 
 + in fig . 
 [ water ] and [ std ] we present the results for water and for standard rock respectively . the simulation performed by geant321 plus 
 gmu reproduces very well the numerical calculation at any energy , both for total energy losses and for the individual processes . 
 + for such materials , the geant321 simulation is in good agreement up to 100 @xmath3 , but it produces much greater average energy loss for energy exceeding 100 @xmath3 . + in table 1 we report the total and the photonuclear energy losses in hydrogen as they result from simulation performed by the two codes ( @xmath23 geant321 ; @xmath24 geant321+gmu ) . 
 the discrepancy is not negligible , even at low energy , being around @xmath25 at 10 @xmath3 . 
 the main source of this disagreement is clearly due to a different estimation of the photonuclear process , whose relative importance grows for light materials . 
 + in order to further verify the reliability of the simulation code we performed some specific runs by recording the fraction @xmath12 of energy lost by muon at the occurrence of each process . 
 ( indeed the average energy loss is not especially sensitive to very big or very small energy transfer ) .

4,"the discovery of a higgs - like particle at the cern - lhc , and the fact that this particle is  lighter "" than what could be expected for the higgs boson in several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is leading to a deeper investigation of the mass generation mechanism as it is known in the sm . 
 many recent papers are discussing the higgs mechanism under new points of view , such as the naturality of the model @xcite , its stability @xcite , and studying possible alternatives or extensions of the model . 
 several years ago the possibility that a conformal classical symmetry could be important in the mass generation mechanism was discussed by meissner and nicolai @xcite . at that time they proposed an extension of the sm where the radiative symmetry breaking calculated with the help of the effective potential , as first suggested by coleman and weinberg ( cw ) @xcite , was compatible with the experimental data then available . 
 the example of @xcite was already giving an answer to the questions of naturality and stability of the higgs mechanism , and the possibility that the sm symmetry breaking could be implemented through radiative corrections is still in discussion @xcite . 
 how the cw effective potential calculation is applicable and reliable in a realistic theory is a motive of debate . 
 meissner and nicolai discussed the applicability of a renormalization group ( rg ) improved version of the one - loop cw effective potential in simple models @xcite , where the behavior of the coupling constants could be easily calculated . 
 the inclusion of the coupling constants evolution extends the validity range of the effective potential . 
 one of the criteria for applicability of the rg improved cw effective potential proposed in @xcite was that the running coupling constants , expressed as functions of the classical field , should stay small . 
 of course , away from the origin the rg @xmath0 functions will depend on the renormalization scheme and how the coupling is defined . 
 however , we should expect the stability of the effective potential certainly to depend on the coupling constants rg behavior in a much larger range of values @xcite .    in the examples of classically conformal theories of @xcite 
 the effective potential stability is connected to ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) barriers caused by the presence of a landau pole in the qed or qcd couplings . 
 however , the existence of a landau pole in these couplings has been questioned , and instead of a pole they may present a non - perturbative fixed point . due to the phenomenon of dynamical symmetry breaking in qed and qcd , the coupling constants may freeze after they reach a certain critical value , whereas in the qcd case , as will be discussed later , such critical value is even not so large . 
 it is the effect of non - perturbative fixed points of these types in the rg improved effective potential calculation , applied to the models of @xcite , that we want to discuss in this work . 
 their effect has not been discussed in the context of the cw potential and they may even modify the potential stability conditions .    in qed the non - perturbative fixed point that we referred to above implies a critical coupling @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the uv critical value of the fine structure constant ( @xmath3 ) . 
 this behavior is a consequence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , in a mechanism similar to the fall into the coulomb center for large charge @xcite , with a @xmath0 function that is approximated by _ = - 2 ( - _ c ) . 
 [ eq0 ] it is not clear whether this fixed point indeed exists , and qed already does not make sense at the physical scale of such critical value , which happens to be above the planck scale . 
 nevertheless , the study of such possibility can be instructive . 
 on the other hand , there are many plausible evidences that qcd develops an infrared non - perturbative fixed point . 
 for instance , the study of dynamical mass generation in qcd indicates that the coupling constant may freeze in the infrared as @xcite ^2(k^2)= , [ eq1 ] where @xmath4 with @xmath5 quark flavors , @xmath6 is the characteristic qcd scale , and @xmath7 is a dynamically generated  effective mass "" for the gluon , whose preferred value is @xmath8 @xcite . the ir value of eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) as well as the compilation of other ir values for the qcd coupling obtained in different phenomenological applications can be seen in @xcite , and they do not indicate an abrupt transition to the non - perturbative regime . 
 we can also quote theoretical estimates of @xmath9 through the functional schrdinger equation , which suggest @xmath10 @xcite . 
 the infrared finite effective charge of qcd , in the context of schwinger - dyson equations , has also been discussed in @xcite and is associated with an infrared finite gluon propagator . actually , finite ir gluon propagators have been confirmed in lattice simulations @xcite , and they do lead to a non - perturbative ir fixed point @xcite . 
 the effect of such non - perturbative coupling constant has not been explored in the case of a cw potential calculation involving qcd . 
 the organization of this work is the following : in sec . 
 ii we discuss the rg improved potential of scalar qed in the presence of a non - perturbative fixed point . 
 this section is a simple example of what we will calculate in the more elaborated case of the cw potential for qcd with a colorless scalar , which is going to be presented in sec . 
 iii . in sec . 
 iv we draw our conclusions . 
 the rg improved effective potential of @xcite for an ordinary scalar field @xmath11 theory with quartic self - interaction and no classical mass term is given by w_eff ( , g , v)=_1(l)^4 exp , [ eq2 ] where @xmath12 may indicate a set of coupling constants , @xmath13 is some renormalization mass scale , l , [ eq3 ] and @xmath14 is an anomalous dimension associated with the coupling constants .    we will discuss the effective potential of eq . 
 ( [ eq2 ] ) in the case of massless scalar qed . the scalar self - coupling and the gauge coupling are respectively given by y=,u= , and their rg equations are 2=a_1 y^2-a_2 yu+a_3u^2 , 2=2bu^2 , [ 2x ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . 
 the anomalous dimension is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . 
 the solutions of eq . 
 ( [ 2x ] ) are    @xmath21    y(l)&=&u(l ) + & + & ( ) , [ eq42 ] where a= , [ eq5a ] is a positive quantity and @xmath22 is a constant chosen to satisfy @xmath23 . 
 the rg improved effective potential at one loop is @xmath24 eq . 
 ( [ eq5 ] ) is the result obtained in @xcite . 
 this result has one striking difference in relation to the unimproved potential , which is the presence of two barriers , one related to the uv landau pole and an ir one where the potential becomes unbounded from below . 
 let us now suppose that the theory has a fixed point at @xmath25 . 
 note that this would be a possibility for qed with fermions as discussed in refs.@xcite , but here this is just an _ ad hoc _ supposition to exemplify what may happen with the effective potential in the case of a possible freezing of the coupling constant . 
 we see in fig . 
 ( [ fig : qed ] ) that the critical point of the perturbative coupling will occur for @xmath26 , while for much smaller @xmath27 values the coupling follows eq . 
 ( [ eq41 ] ) . as a consequence , for small values of @xmath27 we have @xmath28 , and 
 at large @xmath27 the coupling freezes at @xmath29 . 
 the main difference between this work and previous calculations of the rg improved effective potential is the introduction of an interpolating coupling constant joining the perturbative to the non - perturbative regime . 
 the best interpolation formula between these values is given by a @xmath30 function . 
 we make a fit for the gauge coupling assuming the rg standard solution for @xmath31 , and interpolate it in the region @xmath32 with a @xmath30 formula , such that it will be joined to the frozen value of the coupling for @xmath33 . 
 a fit that is reasonable from @xmath34 up to @xmath35 at @xmath36 level is given by u_fit(l)&= & 0.105 ^-1 ( ) + & + & 0.165 . 
 [ eq6 ] in fig . 
 ( [ fig : qed ] ) we show the gauge coupling as a function of @xmath27 , where the dashed curve is the ordinary perturbative behavior with the pole and the continuous curve is the one showing a freezing coupling constant above the critical qed coupling . 
 there is no pole associated with the gauge coupling , and with the help of eq . 
 ( [ eq6 ] ) we can numerically compute the rg solution for the scalar self - coupling shown in eq . 
 ( [ eq42 ] ) , which still has an ir pole . 
 the behavior of this coupling is shown in fig . 
 ( [ fig : qedcoupling : y ] ) . in this figure 
 it is possible to see that the barrier present in the purely perturbative calculation is barely changed , and this is the point where the potential will become unbounded from below @xcite . 
 the behavior of the effective potential is slightly changed for small @xmath27 as may be seen in fig . 
 ( [ fig : wqed ] ) . 
 note that in the qed case the minimum of the effective potential is located in a region of small values of the gauge coupling constant , therefore it is not affected by the non - perturbative uv fixed point . 
 a more interesting case , where the effective potential may change considerably , will be shown in the sequence . 
 let us now consider the following lagrangian : & = & -f_f^+|q^d_q-_^ + & + & g_yq-^4 , [ eq7 ] where @xmath37 are quark fields , @xmath38 is a colorless scalar and @xmath39 is the usual qcd field tensor . in this case 
 we have three different coupling constants : a ) the gauge coupling @xmath40 that appears in @xmath39 and in the covariant derivative @xmath41 , which , for convenience , will be redefined in the following as z , b ) the yukawa coupling @xmath42 , redefined as x , and c ) a scalar self - coupling @xmath43 , which will be referred as y. the rg equations obeyed by these couplings at one - loop are @xmath44 with the scalar anomalous dimension given by @xmath45 , where the values of the different parameters appearing in these equations are @xmath46 , @xmath16 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite . 
 one can find particular solutions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 is chosen to satisfy @xmath56 . 
 the parameter @xmath57 is found in order to obtain a coupling constant compatible with physical values of the qcd coupling . 
 for instance , typical values in @xcite were assumed to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 . 
 the @xmath53 can be also written as @xmath60 @xmath61 and since @xmath62 the power of @xmath52 in the denominator will be negative and at the weak coupling limit @xmath53 has the following behavior x(l)z(l ) , where = . with the @xmath53 solution and the differential equation ( [ eq : ydif ] ) 
 , we obtain @xmath63 at the weak coupling limit , y(l)=z(l ) , [ eqx ] where @xmath64 is a constant and the effective potential is @xmath65    we now depart from what was done in @xcite and assume an _ 
 ad hoc _ fixed point like the one shown in eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) . 
 the qcd ir frozen behavior described in eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) was obtained for pure gauge qcd , and the fixed point of eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) is not modified in the presence of a small number of fermions @xcite . here 
 we assume that the presence of the colorless scalar boson does not change such behavior . 
 moreover , since the model is not realistic , the region where the freezing of the coupling constant occurs will be described by an extra parameter , that we will vary in order to see the general behavior of such fixed point . 
 the qcd coupling constant will be modified in the ir according to @xmath66 where @xmath67 . 
 the parameter @xmath68 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : alphaqcd : l ] ) plays the same role of the dynamical gluon mass in eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) , and @xmath69 is a renormalization scale that can be related to the qcd scale . note that the coupling is frozen for @xmath70 , where @xmath68 is a free parameter in the effective potential calculation . 
 the change is basically what would be expected in actual qcd with dynamical gluon mass generation . 
 consistency between the different couplings implies the same behavior of @xmath52 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) , i.e. away from the fixed point we must have a perfect match between eq . 
 ( [ eq : alphaqcd : l ] ) and the perturbative tail of the gauge coupling in eq . 
 ( [ eq : solutionqcd ] ) . in order to have this agreement of the couplings in the perturbative regime we can adjust the @xmath75 and @xmath76 values in that region @xmath77 . 
 the values that provide a fit of the @xmath52 better than @xmath78 are z^np_0=0.272,a=0.48 . 
 we can see how eq . 
 ( [ eq : alphaqcd : l ] ) behaves as we change the ratio @xmath79 in fig . 
 ( [ fig : znpqcd ] ) , where it is possible to observe the freezing of the coupling in the infrared region . for comparison , 
 the result of @xcite is also shown , appearing in the region where @xmath80 . 
 the scalar coupling @xmath63 can be obtained in two ways . in the first one we can approximate @xmath53 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : solutionqcd ] ) as x(l)z^np(l),= , then we find y^np(l)c z^np(l ) , [ eqy ] where @xmath81 is a constant . 
 this result is the equivalent of eq . 
 ( [ eqx ] ) , i.e. an approximation for the scalar coupling in the very weak coupling regime . 
 therefore the scalar coupling behavior will be similar to the qcd gauge coupling , since the only difference is the constant @xmath22 . 
 in the second case we consider @xmath53 given by eq . 
 ( [ eq : solutionqcd ] ) and solve numerically eq . 
 ( [ eq : ydif ] ) obtaining the full non - perturbative behavior of the coupling @xmath82 . the numerical results using the same initial conditions of @xcite ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath59 ) 
 are shown in fig . 
 ( [ fig : ynpqcdexata ] ) . 
 we noticed that the scalar coupling is quite dependent on the ratio @xmath85 . 
 the result of @xcite at large @xmath27 is obtained with @xmath86 and changes as we move away from this value . 
 finally we can consider the effective potential given by eq . 
 ( [ eq : wqcd ] ) . 
 this one is shown in fig . 
 ( [ fig : wqcd ] ) where it is possible to see that the effective potential of @xcite at small @xmath27 is recovered for @xmath87 . 
 however , this potential has a different behavior as we slowly increase the ratio @xmath79 what can be observed in fig . 
 ( [ fig : wqcd1 ] ) . 
 the striking fact is that the presence of the fixed point changes the position of the minimum of the potential when compared to the one shown in fig . 
 ( [ fig : wqcd ] ) . 
 the stability and reliability of the cw potential can be better studied in the rg improved effective potential approach . 
 however , it is clear that a full analysis of the stability condition of the sm can imply in new physics @xcite as well as on the non - perturbative analysis of the higgs potential @xcite . 
 here we consider the simple examples of scalar qed and qcd with a colorless scalar in order to verify the effect of possible non - perturbative fixed points in the rg effective potential calculation . in 
 @xcite the existence of uv and ir barriers describe the validity of the effective potential in these models and we verify that the existence of the fixed point we referred to above changes the barriers location . 
 we consider scalar qed and assume the existence of a conformal behavior at some critical value of the coupling constant . 
 this is a totally _ ad hoc _ assumption , however this possibility has been extensively considered in the case of qed with fermions and with possible non - trivial four - fermion interactions @xcite . 
 this case is just one example to show the procedure that is going to be applied in the case of qcd with a colorless scalar . 
 the main result is that the barriers found in @xcite basically do not change , and the minimum of the potential is not modified , since it happens at small values of the gauge coupling constant , away from the critical coupling characterizing the non - perturbative fixed point . 
 our second example is qcd with a colorless scalar . 
 here we assume that the qcd gauge coupling has a non - trivial ir fixed point similar to the one that is expected when qcd exhibits the phenomenon of dynamical gauge boson mass generation @xcite . 
 in this case the gauge coupling and scalar coupling barriers found in @xcite are modified , due to the non - existence of a landau pole in the ir behavior of the qcd gauge coupling . however , 
 the most interesting fact is that the minimum value of the potential is changed , as can be observed in fig . 
 ( [ figult ] ) , because in this case the minimum is located in one region of the coupling constant that is governed by the non - perturbative fixed point . 
 of course , these are non - realistic examples but they may indicate that such effect may also affect the calculation of the rg improved effective potential in realistic models . 
 we believe this is a possibility that deserves further study .

5,"in this paper we consider an `` external '' heavy particle that is entangled with its environment . in the past , 
 the decoherence of such a particle was attributed to changes occurring in the environment at large . 
 such an explanation contradicts the principle of locality , according to which the external particle can be effected by environmental potentials at its own location only . in an article by stern , aharonov and imry  @xcite , motivated by furry and ramsey s paper  @xcite , it was shown that decoherence can be explained locally , without taking into account changes of the environment as a whole  @xcite . throughout this paper 
 we use a model where the external , heavy , non recoiling particle is initially in a superposition of two narrow wave packets @xmath0 $ ] , while the environment is represented by an `` internal '' light particle . by `` external '' we mean : accessible to direct observation or manipulation by the experimenter 
 . `` internal '' means  not accessible to the same . 
 we thus discuss entanglement with the environment in terms of a specific entanglement event of the external and the internal particle . 
 such an entanglement event is best illustrated by a one - dimensional scattering event , where the incident light particle representing the environment is scattered from the heavy particle . 
 initially , the two particles are not entangled . 
 then , for a finite duration while the scattering goes on , the two particles are entangled . by the time the scattering is over the two particles 
 have disentangled again . 
 the central distinction in this paper is between `` strong '' and `` weak '' interaction . in general , the former effects a significant change of the environmental degree of freedom which is responsible for the potential in `` real time '' , i.e. , during the time of the interaction . 
 the latter effects no such change . in the scattering example above , strong interaction means strong back - scattering of the light particle , up to total reflection . 
 this in turn yields `` strong '' entanglement . by comparison , 
 a weakly interacting , heavy , external particle would not back - scatter the light particle . 
 we thus consider in this paper an external , heavy , non recoiling particle that is initially in the superposition @xmath1 , strongly interacting with the environment , or light internal particle . during the ensuing entanglement event 
 the external particle may at most pick up a relative phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . 
 thus , when the entanglement event is over , its state is given by @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the duration of the entanglement event . 
 in this paper we ask the question : what , if it exists , is the equivalent , single ( i.e. , external ) particle description of the strong entanglement event ? this is the meaning of locality in the present context . 
 note that the `` locality '' of a quantum particle includes not only the locations of its wave packets but also the interval between them . 
 this is demonstrated by the electric aharonov bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite ( see below ) . 
 thus , in the local picture of the entanglement event we need only focus on the external particle s relative phase . during the strong entanglement event the external particle s 
 instantaneous relative phase changes continuously . starting with a definite initial value , it becomes uncertain for a finite period of time . finally , the relative phase is again definite , but its value may have changed . 
 below , we show that in the local picture this evolution is due to a generalized , self induced electric ab effect . 
 classically , there is no way to distinguish between the two force - free regions outside of an infinite , parallel - plate condenser . 
 the reason is , that a classical particle can reside on only one side of the condenser at a time . 
 thus , classically , the potential difference between the plates is unobservable . by comparison 
 , an external quantum particle can be located on both side of the condenser at once , i.e. , in a superposition @xmath6 , 1@xmath7l , 2@xmath7r . 
 it follows that in quantum theory , the potential difference or , to be precise , @xmath8 mod 2@xmath9 , is observable . 
 this is demonstrated by the electric ab effect .        in the electric ab effect 
 an external charged particle is prepared in a wave packet @xmath10 . 
 the latter is split into two equal wave packets of width @xmath11 each , which are then separated by a distance @xmath12 , and brought to rest . 
 thus the charged particle is initially in the state @xmath13\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\psi_{1}+\psi_{2})$ ] . at @xmath14 , an infinite ( in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , directions ) 
 parallel - plate condenser is `` opened '' in the interval between the packets ( see fig . 1 and  @xcite ) . the distance between the plates is @xmath17 . at a later time 
 @xmath18 the condenser plates are brought back together , and the electric field generated disappears . 
 the two wave packets are then allowed to interfere . throughout the experiment 
 the charged particle is confined to the force - free region outside the condenser . however , because of the electric field inside the condenser , a relative phase is generated , @xmath19\,,\label{eq : i:1}\\ \varphi_{rel}(t\geq t_{1})&=&-\frac{e}{\hbar c}\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}v(t)dt=-\frac{e}{\hbar c}\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\int_{0}^{d(t)}e(t)dx dt \,,\label{eq : i:2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] resulting in a shift of the interference pattern . here 
 @xmath20 is the instantaneous potential difference between the condenser s plates , @xmath21 is their instantaneous separation and @xmath22 is the electric field . in the two - particle picture the strongly interacting non recoiling external particle entangles with the light internal particle . in the local picture 
 the external particle experiences a corresponding , self induced , potential difference between its two wave packets . 
 it is self induced since , if the external particle were removed , the potential would vanish . 
 however , in quantum theory , the self induced potential has an additional , unique feature , which we call privacy . 
 it means that the strongly interacting particle alone experiences this potential . a weakly interacting test particle , by comparison , not only 
 would it not induce an environmental potential , but , even in the presence of a `` strong '' external particle , it would not monitor the private potential that the latter induces . 
 this private potential difference that the external particle experiences , is responsible for the shift of the relative phase in the local picture . 
 alternatively , the phase shift is also given by @xmath23 note that the average forces @xmath24 appearing on the right hand side ( rhs ) of @xmath25 vanish unless the external particle is actually located at the intermediate points between x=0 and x = l . 
 thus , with the external particle in @xmath3 and @xmath2 , these forces vanish . 
 nevertheless , the path integral on the rhs of @xmath25 describes the virtual work done on the external particle while displacing it quasi statically from x = l to x=0 , thus accounting for the private potential difference it experiences in the superposition . 
 the private potential difference depends not on the forces that exist in the interval [ 0,l ] while the external particle is in the superposition , as is the case in the original electric ab effect , equation @xmath26 above . 
 it depends , rather , on the self induced forces that would act on it at the intermediate locations . 
 we call the average forces `` potential '' forces , since when the external particle is in a superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath2 they are only a potentiality . 
 they can be realized , but at the expense of giving up the configuration where the time integration of the private potential difference ( modulo 2@xmath9 ) and the relative phase are observable . 
 this is the generalized electric ab effect . 
 it is , in principle , experimentally verifiable . 
 below ( section 3 ) , an electric ab -type gedanken interference experiment of the external particle is described . 
 the observed shift of the interference pattern is due to a finite self induced , private potential difference experienced by the external particle while the system is in the vacuum state , i.e. , force free space . to conclude : the generalized electric ab effect is contingent on our accepting the principle of locality . in the alternative , two - particle or entanglement picture , 
 the phase shift is explained in an almost trivial way . 
 below , the new concepts are introduced with the help of two applications . in section 2 a one - dimensional exactly solvable scattering problem 
 is described locally . 
 the most natural setting for the new concepts is the born oppenheimer approximation  @xcite(section 3 ) . 
 our discussion highlights a key aspect of the non trivial born oppenheimer set - ups , namely , that the external particle modifies the system with which it interacts , the non trivial born oppenheimer potentials being always private potentials . 
 we apply the born oppenheimer approximation to interference states . 
 our approach then allows us to calculate the external heavy particle s relative phase . in section 4 the uncertainty or dephasing of the relative phase in 
 the born oppenheimer set - up during the interference experiment /entanglement event is calculated . 
 we thus complement the born oppenheimer approximation for interference states . 
 , @xmath2 . the internal particle is initially in a very wide wave packet @xmath27 , moving with velocity @xmath28 . ]    consider the following one - dimensional set - up . 
 it consists of two particles : an `` external '' , heavy particle , of mass m , and an `` internal '' , light particle , representing the environment , of mass m@xmath29 m . 
 the heavy particle , h , is initially in the superposition @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the position of the heavy external particle . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two similar , narrow ( @xmath34 ) wave packets , separated by a distance @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 . the internal , light particle , l , is initially in a gaussian wave packet @xmath37 of width @xmath38 , moving with velocity @xmath28 in the positive @xmath39-direction inside a long , narrow tunnel ( see figs . 
 2,3 and  @xcite ) . 
 @xmath40 is the position of the light internal particle . 
 the two particles interact strongly . 
 this interaction is short - range , and we approximate it by a @xmath41 function . 
 @xmath42 . for @xmath43 the light particle 
 is totally reflected , and complete entanglement of the two particles obtains . 
 we take m sufficiently large so that the recoil of the heavy particle is negligible and only momentum , but no energy is exchanged . ignoring the constant kinetic energy of the heavy particle yields the hamiltonian : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the momentum of the light particle . 
 the state of the system at all times t is @xmath46\ , , \label{eq : ii:3}\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath47 refer to the heavy and light particle , respectively . since we neglected the kinetic energy of the heavy particle , its two wave functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 are constant in time . 
 assuming no recoil of the heavy particle , the hamiltonian @xmath48 can be approximated by ( see appendix a ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 . within this approximation the equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 separate , and 
 the problem is exactly solvable for any @xmath54 ( see appendix b ) . 
 the assumed large width @xmath55 allows us to consider both wave packets @xmath52 and @xmath53 as energy eigenstates with energy @xmath56 and incident momentum @xmath57 . 
 we denote by @xmath58 and by @xmath59 the initial and final states of the light particle . when @xmath60 , the above incident state is completely reflected from either of the two @xmath41 functions . 
 conservation of energy then decrees that it is reflected with momentum @xmath61 and at most a change of phase . 
 specifically , the reflection coefficients from @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath60 are -1 and @xmath64 respectively ( appendix b ) . for the actual wide @xmath65 incident wave packet the average momentum 
 @xmath66 is such that @xmath67 and the uncertainty @xmath68 . 
 the finite width @xmath55 causes a negligible uncertainty in the relative phase @xmath69 . 
 thus , for @xmath70 , after the reflection is over , the system is left in a new state @xmath71 i.e. , with a shift in the relative phase between the two wave packets @xmath3 and @xmath2 of the heavy particle . 
 if for further simplicity we choose @xmath72 , the complete wave function of the system at all times @xmath73 is @xmath74 note that for @xmath75 , @xmath76 reproduces the initial condition @xmath77 . 
 thus , initially , the external particle s relative phase is @xmath78 . by the time t = t , when the two particles have disentangled back again , it has changed to @xmath79 . in deriving equation @xmath80 we assumed that the reflection of a single particle in the incident wave packet of width @xmath55 from the two @xmath41 functions occurs instantaneously . 
 the specific time when an individual reflection occurs is uncertain within @xmath81 . 
 while the reflection goes on , the relative phase is uncertain , the average phase factor equals ( see appendix c ) . 
 this means that by the time t , the external particle has already , with probability @xmath82 , changed its relative phase , so that @xmath83 . 
 however , with probability @xmath84 , it still carries the `` old '' value , @xmath85 . in general , with @xmath86 the initial and final relative phases , we have . 
 thus non trivial entanglement , which is the case during @xmath87 , is characterized by the condition @xmath88 . 
 we now consider the scattering problem from the local point of view . 
 the probability for the external , heavy particle to be found at @xmath39 is @xmath89 . using equation @xmath90 we have , @xmath91\ , . 
 \label{eq : ii:6}\ ] ] in the present context of entanglement , the principle of locality is the condition that all the physics must be observable through measurements of the external particle alone , i.e. , without reference to the environmental degrees of freedom . thus , the probability distribution @xmath92 must be formally equivalent to a single - particle distribution . for a single particle in the coherent superposition @xmath93 
 this is @xmath94\ , , \label{eq : ii:7}\ ] ] where @xmath95 @xmath96 is the potential at the location of the wave packet @xmath97 . in equation 
 @xmath98 the interference term is multiplied by a definite relative phase factor @xmath99 . 
 but when the external particle s relative phase is uncertain as in equation @xmath80 , we must replace the relative phase by its average , i.e. , by @xmath100 . in the above example _ a _ obtains two values @xmath101 and @xmath102 , standing for @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively . comparing equation @xmath92 with @xmath98 , the condition of locality consists of the substitution @xmath105 the scalar product on the left hand side ( lhs ) depends on the external particle s position @xmath31 and on time . in particular , it is assumed that @xmath106 is a scalar potential . 
 @xmath107 is the potential difference responsible for @xmath108 while @xmath109 . 
 equation @xmath110 connects the two - particle or entanglement picture with the local picture . 
 non trivial entanglement , occurring when @xmath111 , which effects decoherence , is attributed in the local picture to the effect of an uncertain scalar potential difference experienced by the external particle . 
 finally , for t = t equation @xmath110 yields @xmath112 having used @xmath113 . note that we have omitted the average sign on the lhs of @xmath114 , since the final relative phase is definite . 
 we next proceed to calculate the potential defined by equation @xmath110 , which is the local substitute for entanglement . 
 as we shall see , it has highly non trivial properties . 
 we look for a solution of @xmath110 . 
 our first guess as to the potential that is responsible for the change of the external particle s relative phase leads to a paradox . with the external particle at x=0 , in @xmath3 
 , the external particle must experience an average environmental potential  @xcite @xmath115 the extremely heavy external particle then acquires an overall phase factor @xmath116 . similarly , 
 if the external particle is located at x = l , in @xmath2 , it acquires an overall phase factor @xmath117 , where . 
 it then follows that , with the external particle in the superposition @xmath118 , it acquires a relative phase . 
 however , the potential difference @xmath119 vanishes identically . since @xmath120 , @xmath121 for real @xmath122 . 
 thus the relative phase must also vanish , contrary to the known facts . 
 it seems as though a scalar potential can not properly reproduce the effects of entanglement with the environment in this case .    . 
 ]    another paradox seems to arise if we add to the set - up an infinite potential step at an intermediate point @xmath123 ( see fig . 
 a calculation using the two - particle picture tells us that in this case the external particle s relative phase changes in proportion to @xmath124 ( appendix d ) . 
 however , if the external particle is in @xmath125 , it totally reflects the internal particle , while if it is in @xmath126 , then its putative interaction with the internal particle is completely preempted by the potential step . in both cases , 
 no information about the position @xmath124 of the barrier can be conveyed to the external particle by average potentials which it supposedly experiences in the local picture . 
 how , then , can the external particle `` know '' the location of the barrier ? 
 we thus return to the defining equation @xmath110 . taking its time derivative , 
 we obtain ( see  @xcite and appendixes a and e ) @xmath127 \label{eq : ii:13}\\ & = & i<\phi _ { 1}(t)\mid \alpha\delta(x_{l})-\alpha\delta(x_{l}-l)\mid \phi_{2}(t ) > \label{eq : ii:14}\\ & = & i<\phi _ { 1}(t)\mid \alpha\delta(x_{l})\mid \phi_{2}(t ) > = -\frac{v_{0}}{w}\left(1- e^{2ip_{0 } l}\right ) \,,\label{eq : ii:15}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the velocity of the internal particle 
 . comparing @xmath128 with @xmath129 we conclude that the former is proportional to a potential difference experienced by the external particle . 
 we call @xmath128 `` private '' potential , to distinguish it from the usual or `` public '' potential experienced by a test particle , to be discussed below . 
 note that the contribution of the potential at @xmath130 vanishes at the limit @xmath60 . at this limit 
 there is total reflection and no transmission at @xmath131 , so that @xmath132 . thus 
 only the first term in equation @xmath133 , involving @xmath62 , contributes . 
 note that throughout the interaction the potential is uncertain , having two values , one of which is equal to zero . 
 integrating @xmath134 yields @xmath135 . by the time @xmath136 , when the internal particle has been completely reflected and the wave packet @xmath137 has moved away from the origin , the private potential @xmath138 , and the relative phase changes no more . 
 it has become definite  its value is @xmath139 , in agreement with the result of the calculation in the two particle picture . 
 thus it is the potential difference proportional to @xmath140 i.e. , @xmath141 , rather than the difference of the average potentials , that is responsible for the shift of the external particle s relative phase . 
 this resolves the first paradox . 
 note that the non vanishing @xmath142 is an interference term . 
 thus the new potential is an interference property of the environmental degree of freedom . 
 this also resolves the second paradox , since in that case @xmath53 is reflected from the barrier , at l@xmath143 , so that the interference term depends on l@xmath143 . 
 however , we shall return to the second paradox below and consider it from another point of view . 
 we distinguish between `` strong '' and `` weak '' interaction . 
 the scattering problem we are considering is an example of an external particle strongly interacting with the environment . 
 it interacts with the internal particle via @xmath144 , which , with @xmath145 , leads to strong reflection of the internal particle . within this context 
 , weak interaction is given by @xmath146 , with @xmath147 . 
 this describes the interaction of an external test particle , which allows the internal particle to continue in its motion without reflection . 
 the hamiltonian of an external heavy , non recoiling , test particle interacting with the internal light particle is @xmath148 . with the internal particle in the wave packet @xmath149 described above 
 , the test particle effectively experiences a time dependent potential . 
 its hamiltonian is @xmath150 where @xmath151 . at a given instant , 
 the potential is non vanishing in the interval of width @xmath55 , the instantaneous location of the internal wave packet . because the interaction is weak , the internal particle passes by the test particle with velocity @xmath28 unperturbed 
 thus , with the test particle initially in a narrow wave packet @xmath152 centered at @xmath153 , it experiences a non vanishing potential for the duration @xmath154 . by the time the entire wave packet has passed by , 
 the test particle s wave packet has acquired a phase , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 . 
 we call @xmath106 `` public '' potential since it can be measured by a test particle . 
 the public potential is always the usual potential , i.e. , the virtual work done against the source when bringing the external particle from infinity to @xmath39 , _ when the source is not affected by the external particle_. this corresponds to the case of an external test particle , which , by definition , does not change the environment . 
 note that , with the external , strongly interacting particle in @xmath3 , the public potential experienced by the test particle is @xmath157 , which vanishes for @xmath158 , while when it is in @xmath2 , the public potential is @xmath159 , which vanishes for @xmath160 . 
 note also , that the difference between private and public potentials is a new feature , a quantum characteristic of the self induced phenomena we are considering . 
 we shall now show that , in the local picture , the entanglement event is a generalized electric ab effect , which resolves the second paradox . 
 we have calculated the total change of the relative phase of the external particle during the scattering event by integrating @xmath134 from @xmath75 to @xmath161 . 
 alternatively , the same change in the external particle s relative phase can be obtained as follows . 
 let the internal particle be initially in a very wide wave packet of width @xmath38 and of average momentum @xmath162 as above . 
 however , unlike the previous set - up , where the external heavy particle was initially in a superposition of two wave packets located at @xmath131 and @xmath130 , respectively , here we assume that the external particle is in a single wave packet @xmath10 centered about any point in the interval @xmath163 . 
 the internal particle will then be reflected at @xmath39 , with momentum @xmath61 , causing the momentum of the external particle to change by @xmath164 . 
 with @xmath154 the time it takes the internal wave packet to be reflected at x , the average momentum transferred to the external particle after time @xmath73 @xmath165 is the weighted average , with probabilities @xmath82 and @xmath84 of the transfers corresponding to the reflections having occurred or not . 
 the quantum average force which is constant both in x and in t , is therefore @xmath166 . 
 we here use the average force to describe the underlying instantaneous but uncertain scattering events which involve singular forces . 
 we recall that with the external particle at x = l , in @xmath2 , the internal particle is reflected with a reflection coefficient @xmath167 ( appendix b ) . in general , with the external particle at x@xmath168=x , the internal particle is reflected with a coefficient @xmath169 , or , @xmath170 . 
 the description so far has been in the two particle picture . in the local picture , where the internal particle s coordinate is integrated out 
 , the same phase factor is associated with the external particle , and we have @xmath171 we use @xmath31 and @xmath39 interchangeably since the very narrow , stationary wave packet @xmath172 behaves like a @xmath41 function at @xmath39 . in the local picture , this constant phase factor is attributed to the impact of a force which the environment must have exerted on the extremely heavy , non recoiling external particle during the time interval [ 0 , t ] . 
 we have ( appendix f ) @xmath173 from @xmath174 it follows that the external particle s phase , @xmath175 , is a continuous function of position . 
 we can therefore write @xmath176 from @xmath177 using @xmath178 and @xmath179 we finally obtain @xmath180dx \nonumber \\ & = & \int_{0}^{l}\delta\langle p_{h}\rangle(x , t)dx = \int_{0}^{l}\int_{0}^{t}\langle f\rangle dtdx = \int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{l}\langle f\rangle dxdt \;.\label{eq : ii:20}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the final relative phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in our particular example @xmath78 . 
 the path integral on the rhs of @xmath182 is the virtual work done on the external particle by the average forces @xmath24 which act on it at the intermediate points @xmath163 . 
 the average force @xmath166 when integrated according to @xmath182 yields @xmath183 . 
 this is the same relative phase as obtained above , by integrating the private potential difference @xmath133 . 
 we conclude that the path integral of the average forces is responsible for the private potential difference given by the rhs of @xmath128 , which the external particle experiences when it is in a superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . 
 note that _ the average force _ 
 @xmath184 _ appearing in _ @xmath182 _ vanishes unless the external particle is actually located at x_. in the two - particle picture we know that the force is due to the short - range strong interaction @xmath185 which is non vanishing only where the external particle is present . according to @xmath186 , the external particle experiences a private potential difference which effects the change of its relative phase only when it is in the superposition @xmath3 and @xmath2 ; thus , in this state , the rhs of @xmath182 involves _ potential _ forces which are , nevertheless , responsible for the non vanishing private potential difference . 
 the average force provides the missing link and resolves the second paradox . 
 specifically , the spatial part of the integral on the rhs of @xmath182 ends at @xmath124 , the location of the barrier , beyond which the forces vanish . hence the @xmath124 dependence . for a discussion of the uncertainty of the relative phase throughout the entanglement event see appendix g.      equations @xmath128 together with equation @xmath182 
 describe a  generalized  electric ab effect . 
 the path integral on the rhs of equation @xmath182 is the virtual work done on the external particle when displacing it quasi statically from x=0 to x = l . 
 it is the analog , in the present context , of the line integral @xmath187 of the electric field across the plates of a condenser , which is responsible for the shift of relative phase in the usual electric ab effect . 
 however , there is a crucial difference . in the usual electric ab effect , the macroscopic electric field of the condenser is independent of the external charge . in the present case , 
 the path integral of the average forces and the definite private potential difference belong to incompatible set - ups . 
 this is the generalized electric ab effect , as illustrated by the scattering problem . above 
 , we have outlined a new version of an electric ab effect , which differs from the original one in an essential way . 
 yet this is so only if the local approach is taken seriously . in the two - particle picture , 
 the two scattering events , occurring at x=0 and x = l , respectively , are independent . 
 each produces its own position dependent phase , and they are explained locally . by comparison , in the local picture the external particle alone is considered , together with the potential differences and forces that may act upon it . in this picture 
 we have a single event : the creation of a private potential difference between x=0 and x = l , observable only by means of an interference experiment of the external particle . in the absence of any additional agent , this potential difference must be explained in terms of the virtual work done on the external particle . 
 the connection between @xmath186 and @xmath182 must be made . 
 thus , the interpretation as an electric ab effect is forced upon us in the local picture . 
 it also follows that it is only when locality is taken seriously , i.e. , as an equally valid description of physics , that the above describes a new kind of an electric ab effect , or quantum phenomenon . to conclude . 
 we have introduced the basic concepts using the simple scattering problem as an illustration . 
 yet it has its limitations . 
 firstly , in the scattering problem there is no simple connection between the private potential difference and the path integral . 
 secondly , we have not been able to describe an experiment that will demonstrate the effect of the private potential in an unquestionable way . 
 these shortcomings will be remedied in the next section , where an adiabatically changing , strongly interacting system will be described , using the born oppenheimer approximation . 
 we consider a two - level system , represented here by an electric dipole whose positive charge is fixed at the origin . 
 such a system can be described by the three pauli matrices @xmath188 let us describe the system in the representation where @xmath189 is diagonal . 
 the polarization in the z direction is proportional to @xmath190 and the energy difference between the two free levels is proportional to @xmath189 . 
 an external , heavy , charged particle of charge q , moving along the positive @xmath16 axis interacts strongly with the dipole . 
 the interaction is @xmath191 where we have approximated the separation @xmath192 . for a given position @xmath16 of the external particle 
 , the dipole s hamiltonian is @xmath193 with @xmath194 a slowly varying adiabatically on- and off - switching function such that @xmath195 . 
 the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the external particle s momentum and m is its mass . 
 initially , at @xmath198 , the dipole is closed , i.e. , @xmath199 . at that time , the dipole is in its ground state : @xmath200 . 
 hence the initial state is unpolarized , @xmath201 . 
 the ground state energy is @xmath202 . 
 the other eigenstate is @xmath203 with an energy gap of @xmath204 between the states . 
 the external particle is prepared to be at rest in a coherent superposition , @xmath205,$ ] such that @xmath3 is , effectively , outside the range of the interaction . 
 the two wave packets are enclosed in small spherical faraday cages centered at @xmath206 , @xmath207 , respectively , with the cage containing @xmath3 being grounded . 
 this ensures that there is no interaction between the dipole and the external particle when in @xmath3 ( see fig.5 ) .     and 
 @xmath2 , contained in the faraday cages c@xmath143 , c@xmath208 respectively . 
 the dipole is at the origin . ] 
 the interaction is now turned on adiabatically , until g(t ) reaches at @xmath209 its maximal value @xmath210 such that @xmath211 \sim\alpha$ ] . 
 the adiabaticity ensures that the dipole remains in its instantaneous ground state @xmath212 throughout , and that the ground state energy changes according to @xmath213  @xcite . 
 in addition , the dipole becomes polarized ( appendix h ) , @xmath214 when the external particle is in @xmath3 the polarization is negligible , while if it is in @xmath2 , a finite dipole moment is induced . 
 thus the external particle and the dipole have become entangled . 
 we now proceed to solve for the time evolution of the external particle . in the born oppenheimer approximation  @xcite 
 one assumes that the light degree of freedom is in an eigenstate of energy . 
 thus , with the dipole prepared in the ground state of its free hamiltonian and the adiabatic turning - on of the interaction , the born oppenheimer approximation is applicable . 
 the born oppenheimer hamiltonian of the external particle is then given by @xmath215 the single valuedness of @xmath216 is in the adiabatic `` limit '' . 
 this guarantees that it is a bona - fide potential function . when m@xmath217 and the kinetic energy of the external particle is neglected , the state of the system is @xmath218\ , , \label{eq : iii:5}\ ] ] where @xmath219 $ ] , @xmath220>=\mid\phi_{g}[z(i),t]>$ ] . 
 we would like now to calculate the born oppenheimer potential difference @xmath221-e_{g}[z(1),t]\equiv e_{2}(t)-e_{1}(t)$ ] that is seen by the external particle , by integrating the forces acting on it . 
 consider the dipole s hamiltonian@xmath222 . 
 note that @xmath16 , the position of the external particle , is here a parameter . using stationary state perturbation theory to calculate the change in the dipole s ground state energy , we obtain ( appendix i ) @xmath223-e_{g}[z(1),t]=-\int_{z(1)}^{z(2)}\langle f\rangle dz \,.\label{eq : iii:6}\ ] ] 
 the rhs of @xmath224 is the work done when displacing the external particle quasi statically from z(1 ) to z(2 ) . 
 the average force equals @xmath225 . in general , the polarization @xmath226 may , or may not , depend on the external particle s position . for the strongly interacting external particle we are considering , the polarization does depend on the external particle s position and 
 is given by @xmath227 above . 
 thus , in this case , the rhs of @xmath224 is a private potential difference , since it is the work done against a position dependent force . 
 we obtain , @xmath228}+\alpha \,,\label{eq : iii:7}\end{aligned}\ ] ] having used @xmath229=0 $ ] . 
 note that the rhs of @xmath230 is a difference of the non trivial born oppenheimer potential calculated earlier on , confirming @xmath224 for this particular case . 
 however , it also follows from @xmath230 that the non trivial born oppenheimer potential is always a private potential . 
 this is so since , as the calculation shows , it is the work done against the position dependent polarization . to put the private potential @xmath230 into further perspective , 
 let us compare it with the relevant public potential which , by definition , is obtained by integrating @xmath224 when the polarization is a constant . 
 this is the case when the external particle interacts only weakly with the dipole , i.e. , when it is a test particle . 
 the hamiltonian in this case is @xmath231\label{eq : iii:8}\\ h'_{bo}&=&\frac{p_{t}^{2}}{2m_{t}}+e_{g}'(z_{t})\,,\label{eq : iii:9}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath232 @xmath233f(z_{t})$ ] is the ground state energy of @xmath234 ( appendix j ) . 
 note that we have included a strongly interacting external particle located at a fixed position z@xmath235 , which effects a constant polarization of the atom @xmath236 . 
 because of the weak coupling @xmath237 , _ the polarization does not depend on the test particle s position_. the integration @xmath224 yields in this case @xmath238\int_{z(1)}^{z(2)}\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_{t}}dz_{t}\nonumber\\ & = & g(t)[\langle\sigma_{3}\rangle(z_{0})]f(z_{t})\mid_{z(1)}^{z(2)}=g(t)[\langle\sigma_{3}\rangle(z_{0})]f[z(2 ) ] \,,\label{eq : iii:10}\end{aligned}\ ] ] having used @xmath229=0 $ ] . 
 this , by definition , is the public potential difference i.e. , the work done on the external test particle when the environmental degree of freedom , the polarization , does not depend on the former s position . 
 note that @xmath239 is in agreement with the born oppenheimer potential of the test particle @xmath240 . 
 note that when the external strongly interacting particle and the external test particle are located at the same point , they experience the same force @xmath241\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$ ] . 
 we disregarded the difference in the coupling constants @xmath237 versus 1 . 
 once the position of the `` strong '' particle is given , the polarization is determined . 
 thus , with the `` strong '' external particle at @xmath16 , the force experienced by the test particle at another position , @xmath242 say , is @xmath243\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_{t}}\right)_{z_{1}}$ ] . 
 however , notwithstanding the possible difference in their magnitude , there is another , essential , difference between the forces experienced by the two particles . 
 a test particle monitors a force that is always an independent physical reality . in our particular case 
 the polarization is not affected by the test particle . 
 thus also , the force due to this polarization is an independent physical reality , as far as the test particle is concerned . 
 another example of such an `` objective '' force is the electric field inside a parallel plate capacitor . 
 clearly , the electric field exists independently of a test particle that may be placed inside the capacitor to measure it . by comparison , 
 the force experienced by the strongly interacting external particle is self induced and vanishes when the external particle is removed , since then the polarization vanishes too . 
 we now turn to what is the main concern of the present section which is , consideration of the particle - dipole entanglement event locally . in the final analysis 
 , applying locality here means performing an interference experiment of the external particle . 
 we therefore calculate the external particle s average instantaneous relative phase factor during the interference experiment /entanglement event , using @xmath244 and @xmath110 . writing the entangled state as 
 @xmath245 $ ] with @xmath246 , we obtain @xmath247dt ' } \,.\label{eq : iii:11}\ ] ] to calculate the scalar product , note that @xmath248 is the ground state . 
 @xmath249 can be written as @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is orthogonal to @xmath252 . @xmath253 . 
 thus @xmath254 . 
 r(t ) is real since the problem is two - dimensional . 
 we obtain @xmath255dt ' } \,.\label{eq : iii:13}\ ] ] @xmath256 when the external particle and the dipole are entangled . 
 the former s relative phase is then uncertain . 
 this is the local manifestation of the entanglement . in general 
 , locality means that the average instantaneous relative phase must be observable . 
 and so it is . 
 `` fast interference '' , where the external particle s wave packets are brought together to interfere abruptly , yields the instantaneous relative phase . 
 this is confirmed by sudden perturbation theory . 
 the characteristic feature of an interference experiment in the present context is that , both at the beginning and at the end , the external particle and dipole are disentangled . 
 the external particle s relative phase is thus definite at these times . 
 we have @xmath257 and @xmath258 . with @xmath259 , @xmath260 . 
 thus @xmath261dt ' } \,,\label{eq : iii:14}\ ] ] where we have omitted the average sign since at @xmath262 the relative phase is definite . @xmath263 . 
 note that @xmath264 is not given by the born oppenheimer potentials . investigating this additional phase and , in particular , its ( possibly ) more general three - dimensional counterpart , 
 is beyond the scope of this paper . 
 equations @xmath265 and @xmath266 connect the particle - dipole picture with the local picture of the external particle by itself . 
 this complements the born oppenheimer approximation which does not address interference states of the external particle . using @xmath224 
 we finally obtain for the relative phase that is measured in the interference experiment @xmath267-e_{g}[z(1),t]\right]dt   = \int_{-\infty}^{t_{final}}\int_{z(1)}^{z(2)}\langle f\rangle dzdt \,,\label{eq : iii:15}\ ] ] where we have returned to the notation used in equation @xmath224 for the born oppenheimer potentials . 
 thus the overall change of the external particle s relative phase during the interference experiment /entanglement event is given by the born oppenheimer potentials up to @xmath263 . 
 equation @xmath268 describes an electric ab effect , but with a difference , since the average forces @xmath24 replace the classical electric field of the usual electric ab effect . 
 note that _ the average force at a point vanishes unless the particle s wave packet is located at the point_. it follows that the path integral on the rhs of @xmath268 is the work done on the external particle when its ( single ) wave packet @xmath10 is actually displaced quasi statically from @xmath206 to @xmath207 ( or from one faraday cage to the other ) . 
 given the self induced nature of the forces , this can also be understood on physical grounds . for only if the external particle is actually located in the interval between @xmath206 and @xmath207 , does it induce the polarization @xmath269 which , in turn , gives rise to the forces @xmath241\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$ ] . 
 thus , when the external particle is in @xmath3 and @xmath2 the relative phase is observable , and the forces are not observable . on the other hand , 
 when the forces are observable , the relative phase is unobservable , since it is impossible to perform an interference experiment when the external particle is in a single wave packet . 
 thus , the private potential difference and the pertinent path integral of forces have become incompatible aspects of the set - up . 
 we call these `` potential '' forces since , when the relative phase is observable , they are only a potentiality . in the particle - dipole picture 
 the shift of the relative phase as well as the effect of the continuum of forces are independently explained by the particle - dipole interaction . 
 it is only in the local picture , from which the dipole is excluded , that we read the shift of the relative phase as a generalized electric ab effect . 
 only then is the path integral of potential forces the only possible explanation for the private potential difference , and the two `` events '' become interrelated . 
 thus , it is only when the local approach is taken seriously , that we have here by necessity a new version of an electric ab effect . as is apparent from equation @xmath265 , the born oppenheimer potentials , although giving the relative phase that is measured in an interference experiment , at @xmath262 , up to @xmath263 , are not the exact instantaneous private potentials at intermediate times , which derive from @xmath270 . 
 we shall next describe an interference experiment measuring the relative phase @xmath268 ( see fig . 
 initially , two open faraday cages c@xmath143 and c@xmath208 are placed at @xmath206 , @xmath207 , respectively , and the external , heavy , strongly interacting particle is in a single wave packet @xmath10 centered at @xmath271 . at @xmath272 the wave packet 
 is split into two equal parts @xmath3 and @xmath2 which are accelerated and move with velocities @xmath273 , respectively , until they are brought to rest inside the faraday cages , which are then closed . 
 the interaction is now adiabatically turned on and later again adiabatically turned off . 
 after the interaction is turned off , when the faraday cages are opened , the wave packets leave the cages and are brought to overlap and interfere . 
 the switching - on and -off function is @xmath274 the interaction strength is kept at its maximal value @xmath275 for the duration @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the finite switching - on and -off time , with @xmath278 guaranteeing the adiabaticity , and being sufficient to justify the formal infinite time integrations above and in section 4 . 
 the single valuedness of the adiabatic limit guarantees that the system disentangles as @xmath194 is turned off . 
 specifically , @xmath279-e_{g}[z(1),t ] \right\ } dt \label{eq : iii:18}\\ = \left[\sqrt{\alpha^{2}+g^{2}(0)f^{2}[z(2)]}-\alpha\right](t_{2}-t_{1})\,,\label{eq : iii:19}\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath263 . 
 we have ignored the relative phase accumulated during the opening and closing time . repeating the experiment with n similarly prepared dipole - particle pairs , 
 the shift of the interference pattern becomes observable . repeating the experiment , varying the duration @xmath5 with the same switching - on and -off time @xmath277 , equation @xmath280 should be confirmed . 
 note that both wave packets , being enclosed in faraday cages while the interaction is on , are confined to force - free regions throughout the experiment . 
 we shall now show that by replacing the single dipole by two dipoles in the experiment , we can make the public potentials and the forces vanish everywhere for the duration @xmath5 . yet 
 the private potential difference and the ensuing relative phase do not vanish . 
 the hamiltonian is @xmath281 dipole 1 is initially prepared to be in the ground state , namely the state @xmath282 , while dipole 2 is prepared in the excited state , @xmath283 . 
 thus the dipoles polarizations are reversed . 
 this implies that it is possible to make the public potential and the forces vanish everywhere during the time interval @xmath284 $ ] , by choosing @xmath285 ( appendix k ) . 
 but there still is a non vanishing private or born oppenheimer potential difference between the faraday cages ( appendix k ) which will manifest in a shift of the interference pattern . 
 note that the condition for the vanishing of the effective total polarization is satisfied , in general , at a single point , @xmath286 say . 
 the enclosure of @xmath2 in a spherical faraday cage centered at @xmath286 guarantees that the condition is met even though the wave packet has finite width . 
 the finite private potential difference between @xmath286 and @xmath206 seems to contradict the vanishing of the forces everywhere . 
 in fact , there is no contradiction . 
 the forces are monitored by test particles , when the `` strong '' external particle is in a superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , located at @xmath206 and @xmath286 , respectively ; while the private potential difference equals the path integral of the forces acting on the `` strong '' particle when it is displaced from @xmath206 to @xmath286 . 
 note also that the total effective polarization when the external particle is at @xmath286 , vanishes only during the time interval @xmath284 $ ] , or when the interaction strength is at its maximal value @xmath275 ( appendix k ) . 
 thus , while the interaction is turned on and off , the system is not in vacuum . 
 however , repeating the experiment varying @xmath5 with the same @xmath277 , will prove that the observed phase shift occurred while the system was in vacuum . 
 for the sake of simplicity we have omitted in the hamiltonian @xmath287 the coulomb interaction between the two dipoles . in the present framework 
 this interaction , which disfavours the state when the two dipoles are parallel , is modeled by an additional interaction term @xmath288 . 
 the full hamiltonian is @xmath289 . roughly speaking , 
 since the coupling term enhances reversed polarization , the condition for the vanishing of the public potential , i.e. , @xmath290 , can be readily met in this more realistic case as well . 
 the detailed calculation may be discussed in the future . 
 so far we mainly focused on the interference obtained after the two wave packets @xmath3 and @xmath2 were made to overlap again . in this case the born oppenheimer private potentials effect a shift of the relative phase @xmath268 , which manifests in the interference pattern . 
 we now address the uncertainty of the relative phase . to this end 
 we consider the operator ( appendix g ) . 
 @xmath291 from which @xmath268 is obtained as an expectation value at @xmath262 . 
 this allows us to calculate the uncertainty of the relative phase , which is the manifestation of the underlying entanglement . 
 specifically , we shall now show that , 1 . 
 after the dipole has been closed ( at @xmath292 ) and the external particle has disentangled from the polarizable atom , the uncertainty vanishes , i.e. , @xmath293 . 
 2 . at intermediate times , 
 when the external heavy particle is entangled , the uncertainty @xmath294 does not vanish . in the heisenberg representation 
 the force is given by @xmath295 to calculate @xmath296 we write the dipole s hamiltonian as @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the energy ( precession frequency ) and @xmath299 is the spin operator in the direction of a fictitious magnetic field . @xmath300 and @xmath301    , @xmath302 , @xmath303 . ] 
 note that @xmath304 , rather than @xmath305 , is in fact the usual polar angle ( see also fig . 7 ) . 
 the orthogonal ( in the @xmath306 plane ) spin operator is defined to be @xmath307 using @xmath308 and @xmath309 we can now write @xmath190 in terms of @xmath302 and @xmath310 . 
 but the solution for @xmath190 is particularly simple in the heisenberg representation . 
 we therefore write @xmath311 where @xmath312 . 
 equation @xmath313 is obtained from @xmath308 and @xmath309 after transforming to the heisenberg representation . at @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 . 
 thus @xmath316 and @xmath317 . 
 since at that time the dipole is prepared in the ground state of the hamiltonian , we also have @xmath318 . 
 we now assume that at @xmath198 the schr@xmath319dinger and heisenberg representations coincide . 
 it follows that also @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and the heisenberg state ( at all times ) is given by @xmath322 now in the adiabatic limit the dipole is in the instantaneous ground state of the hamiltonian throughout . in the heisenberg representation 
 this reads @xmath323 , ( since at the adiabatic limit the hamiltonian in the heisenberg representation equals  @xcite @xmath324 ) . 
 it then follows from @xmath325 that @xmath326 i.e. , @xmath327 is a constant of the motion . 
 hence @xmath328 rotates in the perpendicular @xmath329 plane : @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the azimuthal angle . 
 equations @xmath332 and @xmath333 conform with the boundary condition @xmath321 . substituting @xmath334 and @xmath332 into @xmath313 
 we finally obtain @xmath335 \,.\label{eq : iv:25}\ ] ] we next calculate the uncertainty of the relative phase@xmath336 . using equations @xmath337 and @xmath338 . 
 we recall that since in the heisenberg representations the dipole is in an eigenstate of @xmath189 , @xmath339 , only the terms in @xmath340 and @xmath190 in @xmath338 have a non vanishing contribution . 
 thus @xmath341 where @xmath342 to prove our claims no . 1 and no . 2 above 
 , it suffices to calculate the integrals @xmath343 and @xmath344 . rather than @xmath343 , @xmath344 
 , we use @xmath345 for simplicity we first consider the same integrand without the @xmath346 factor . we claim that for a general adiabatic function @xmath347 @xmath348 where @xmath349 . 
 this can be readily proven by taking the derivatives of both sides of equation @xmath350  @xcite . 
 returning now to the integral of interest @xmath351 we note that @xmath352 @xmath353 is itself adiabatic , since @xmath354 , + @xmath355 . 
 thus , we can apply @xmath350 to @xmath356 , obtaining @xmath357 all the above applies for @xmath73 in the regions @xmath358 and @xmath359 where @xmath194 varies , and trivially also in the region @xmath360 where @xmath194 is constant . 
 we next return to claim no . 1 above . 
 to prove it , it suffices to show that @xmath361 . from @xmath362 
 we find that @xmath363 both terms on the rhs vanish by the definition of @xmath194 . as for our claim 
 2 , the non vanishing of @xmath294 at finite times , it also trivially follows from @xmath362 . 
 our discussion so far has been largely conceptual . 
 we now briefly address the feasibility of the experiments described above . in order to achieve an effective two - level system , 
 a very small splitting between the ground state and the first excited state , as compared with all other energy differences of the system , is required . in the present electric dipole context we model the `` polarizable atom '' by a single electron ( or ion ) which tunnels between two small conducting regions ( or traps ) . 
 the distance @xmath364 between these regions is much larger than their size @xmath365 . in this 
 essentially double - well system the ground state ( excited state ) of the electron is the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) superposition @xmath366 , respectively , where @xmath367 @xmath368 refers to the electron being in the ground state of the left ( right ) potential well . 
 the splitting between the two levels ( @xmath204 in our terminology ) is thus rather small . 
 hence also our requirement that the interaction strength with the external particle be of order of @xmath54 which determines the splitting can be readily met with no additional demand on the size of its charge . 
 to verify the applicability of the adiabatic approximation in the two - level system sketched above , we use the following qualitative argument . 
 let @xmath369 o(100 @xmath370 ) and @xmath371 o(1000 @xmath370 ) . 
 the choice of @xmath365 implies that the first excited state of the single electron in each of the circular patches separately is @xmath372 above the ground state . on the other hand , the splitting 2@xmath54 in the double 
 well , which is proportional to the tunneling frequency @xmath373 , is vastly smaller than @xmath374 . 
 this last frequency critically depends on the distance between the patches and can be tuned to a desired , sufficiently large , value . 
 specifically , we use this to ensure the adiabatic condition @xmath3751 where @xmath277 is the switching - on and -off time . +

 these equations follow since the @xmath10 s do not depend on time , , + , + and , since @xmath3 , @xmath2 , are orthogonal at all times since there is no recoil . 
 the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath383 for @xmath384 , @xmath385 , are , respectively , @xmath386 boundary conditions : + a.@xmath387 b. writing the stationary state schr@xmath319dinger equation @xmath388\phi \ , , \label{eq : rt:3}\ ] ] integrating from @xmath389 to @xmath390 , letting @xmath391 , @xmath392 where the dimensionless @xmath393 . 
 equations @xmath394 , @xmath395 and @xmath396 yield @xmath397 with the potential @xmath398 and @xmath399 , @xmath400 , now pertaining to @xmath401 , @xmath402 , respectively , the reflection and transmission coefficients at x = l are , respectively , @xmath403 and @xmath404 . a concise and physically revealing way to calculate the relative phase presents itself in the heisenberg picture . for a single particle in the superposition 
 @xmath405 $ ] the relative phase factor is given by the average the displacement operator @xmath406 having used @xmath407 . 
 the average displacement operator also equals the relevant fourier transform of the particle s velocity distribution , since @xmath408\ , . 
 \,\label{eq : displacement:2}\ ] ] thus a change of the relative phase means that the velocity distribution has changed . given the two particle state @xmath90 the average of the external particle s displacement operator equals @xmath409 since in this case the relative phase factor is uncertain . for further discussion of this subject see  @xcite . with an additional , infinite potential step at x = l@xmath143 , 
 the hamiltonian is @xmath410 , where @xmath411 is given by @xmath382 and @xmath412 , @xmath413 , and @xmath414 otherwise . with the external particle in @xmath3 
 , the internal particle sees the potential @xmath415 . at the limit 
 @xmath60 the @xmath41 function potential at the origin totally reflects the light particle . 
 thus energy eigenstate for @xmath384 is @xmath416 with the external particle in @xmath2 , the internal particle sees the infinite potential step alone . 
 the solution for @xmath417 is @xmath418 thus the overall solution at all times t is given by @xmath419 we calculate here the interference term of the potential ( i.e. , the private potential ) at x = l and at x=0 , and solve equation @xmath134 . 
 the following is based on appendix b. @xmath393 , @xmath420 thus @xmath421 . at x 
 = l we have @xmath422 @xmath423 thus the private potential vanishes at x = l for @xmath60 . at x=0 
 we have @xmath424 @xmath425 note that the private potential at x=0 is finite . using @xmath426 and @xmath427 we obtain from equation @xmath133 @xmath428 
 this is equation @xmath134 . 
 its solution is @xmath429 the heavy , i.e. , non recoiling external particle may be described by a stationary gaussian wave packet . with the external particle located at @xmath163 
 we have @xmath430 such that @xmath431 . 
 @xmath432 the imaginary part of @xmath433 vanishes since @xmath434 is an even function of @xmath31 and @xmath435 is odd . 
 the real part equals @xmath436 since the very narrow stationary gaussian distribution @xmath437 behaves like a @xmath41 function at @xmath39 . 
 thus , in this case , the average momentum equals the gradient of the phase . 
 first note that for an ensemble of n particles all in the same state @xmath438 one can define an hermitean operator @xmath439 whose eigenvalue is @xmath175 . 
 from @xmath440 we infer that @xmath441 where @xmath442 is the impulse of the force . 
 its uncertainty is given by @xmath443 having used schwartz s inequality . 
 thus a necessary condition for preserving the coherence of the entangled external particle is given by @xmath444 in other words , the locally measurable forces and their impulses provide only a necessary condition for coherence of an external particle that interacts with the environment . 
 in particular it follows from equation @xmath445 , and from @xmath446 , that both initially and finally the uncertainty of the change of the relative phase vanishes , i.e. , @xmath447 . at these times 
 there is no reflection and therefore @xmath448 . 
 thus only at intermediate times the change of the relative phase is uncertain . 
 note also that the impulse of the force @xmath449 is determined by measuring directly the change of the particle s momentum , rather than by measuring the initial and final momenta separately . to calculate the polarization , 
 let @xmath450 , @xmath451 . the stationary schr@xmath319dinger equation for the ground state

 writing the dipole s 
 hamiltonian @xmath455 , let @xmath456 and consider a virtual displacement @xmath457 of the external particle . 
 we use stationary state perturbation theory to calculate the corresponding change in the ground state energy of the dipole .

 we show that under this condition the private potential difference between the faraday cages is , in general , different from zero .

6,"quantum biology is an emerging field of research which aims at investigating the possibility of a functional role for quantum mechanics or coherent quantum effects in biological systems . 
 notably , much of the work made in the last years have been related to transport , being the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex an important example @xcite . 
 this pigment - protein complex is present in green sulfur bacteria and its function is to channel excitons from the chlorosome antenna complex , where light is harvested , to the reaction center which execute the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis . 
 much of the attention given to this complex , and to quantum biology , in general , arose from the experimental observation of long - lived oscillatory features using ultrafast 2-d spectroscopy @xcite . 
 such oscillations were interpreted as evidence for the presence of long - lived electronic coherence , something not trivial given the complexity of these open systems . 
 after these experimental observations , many efforts have been made to explain the origin of those coherences @xcite , and also to investigate their possible relation with entanglement and other quantum related effects @xcite . 
 due to its particular features and efficiency , ion channels constitute another biological system where non trivial quantum effects may appear and be functional @xcite . 
 these channels are transmembrane proteins and they have an important role in the production of electric signals in biological systems @xcite . 
 their structure gives rise to a selectivity filter which is a very narrow channel which catalyses the dehydration , transfer , and rehydration of the ions in a very efficient way , achieving a flux of about @xmath1 ions per second @xcite . 
 throughly crystallographic studies and free energy computer simulations showed , more than ten years ago , that ion translocation in the filter involves transitions between two main states , and that these transitions occur through two physically distinct pathways of conduction @xcite . 
 these pathways involve either two or three k@xmath0 ions occupying the selectivity filter . 
 details about the experiment and the simulations demonstrating that ion translocation in the channel unmistakably follows two distinct paths can be found in methods section of @xcite .    in this work , 
 we consider a quantum model with two conduction pathways in accordance with experimental results and simulations in potassium channels @xcite . 
 consequently , the transport in this system constitutes a two - path problem where quantum superposition effects coming from the _ competing paths _ of conduction play a decisive role . since we treat here the ionic current in the filter , the results predicted in this work can in principle be experimentally accessed with physiological techniques @xcite . 
 this requires the filter to be driven by a periodic time dependent electric field which is also included in our analyses . in the following , we present the basic elements of the model and the inclusion of the driving field . 
 we then study the ionic conduction or current , highlighting the possible advantages of having two and not just one conduction path . 
 in particular , we study the role of having non uniform dephasing in the topology , given that this is the most likely physical picture in the selectivity filter . 
 in the systematically studied kcsa potassium channel from soil bacteria _ streptomyces lividians _ , whose structure is very well known @xcite , k@xmath0 ions loose their hydrating water molecules to enter the selectivity filter and carbonyl oxygen atoms in its backbone replace the water molecules . 
 this allows the formation of a series of coordination shells through which the k@xmath0 ions can move . 
 qualitatively distinguishable configurations of ions and water molecules in the selectivity filter correspond to different configurations which will be represented here as two - level systems . to be more specific , 
 if a site @xmath2 is populated i.e. , in state @xmath3 , this configuration is active . otherwise , if it is in state @xmath4 , this configuration is not active or not participating in the ionic conduction . in a classical hoping mechanism , 
 we would never find superpositions in one configuration ( being _ and _ not being used ) or entanglement between different configurations ( different sites ) . 
 such quantum coherent events lead to resonances in the ionic current which might be measured directly using physiological techniques @xcite . 
 ion translocation in the kcsa consists of k@xmath0 ions that proceed along the pore axis of the selectivity filter in a single fashion with water molecules intercalating them . 
 this gives rise to two main configurations , usually denoted as * 1 - 3 * and * 2 - 4 * , representing the position of a pair of k@xmath0 ions in the selectivity filter as depicted in figure [ s ] . 
 the smaller these numbers are , the closer to the extracellular side the ions are . for the sake of simplicity in notation 
 , we will denote here * 2 - 4 * by @xmath5 ( source ) and * 1 - 3 * by @xmath6 ( drain ) , indicating that we will assume that * 2 - 4 * is in part driven incoherently by interactions of intracellular k@xmath0 ions with the carbonyl oxygens in the entrance of the channel , and * 1 - 3 * can decay incoherently to another configuration culminating with an ion leaving the cell . 
 these processes can be described by lindblad superoperators in the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) causes incoherent pump ( decay ) in the source ( drain ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the incoherent pump ( decay ) rate for the source ( drain ) , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the two - level raising and lowering operator which create ( destroy ) excitations in site @xmath14 . 
 hereafter , @xmath15 denotes the anticommutator @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the density operator for the four sites .     and water molecules h@xmath18o ( not shown ) 
 . @xmath19 are binding sites which are numbered according to convention that numbers decrease when the ion proceeds from intra- to extracellular space . ] 
 there are two optimal pathways connecting @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , and they will be denoted here by numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with no risk of confusing them with the main configurations since these are now denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 . 
 figure [ top ] depicts this two - path network on the left panel . on the right panel , we present a linear single - path chain which will serve as a benchmark to test for a possible quantum advantage of the two pathway conduction . along pathway 
 @xmath20 , an ion first approaches the intracellular entrance to the selectivity filter , and then pushes the two ions in the filter , causing the outermost ion to leave the channel into the extracellular side . 
 this is known as _ concentration - dependent path _ @xcite . in the second optimal pathway , the _ concentration - independent path _ , the two ions in the filter move first , leaving a gap in the selectivity filter which will attract an incoming ion from intracellular space . all microscopic elementary steps involved in these transitions can occur reversibly @xcite . 
 for this reason , we represent the situation by a hopping term in the hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a hopping rate and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) with @xmath25 is the two - level raising ( lowering ) operator for site @xmath2 . 
 for the two ( single ) pathway topology we take @xmath26 @xmath27 . 
 of course , these configuration changes do not take place at the same rate , but we kept them equal in this treatment for the sake of simplicity . our main goal is to discuss the general aspects of the problem . 
 is incoherently driven and excitations hop thorough the network until it is incoherently dissipated through the drain @xmath6 . 
 ( right ) single - path topology . 
 all sites are subjected to dephasing ( wavy arrows ) . 
 the selectivity filter in potassium ion channels uses a two - path configuration for changing between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . ] 
 the last section , and especially hamiltonian ( [ hhop ] ) , refers to the channel under natural conditions in the cell membrane . in this case , there are only small electric fields due to concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell and also charged residues of aminoacids forming the filter . 
 now , we will consider a particular technique which allows one to probe individual channels in the membrane and to subject them to different electric fields and chemical environments . 
 this technique , called patch clamping @xcite , enables one to subject the ions in the channel to constant and time - dependent potentials due to applied electric fields @xcite . 
 consequently , this changes the free energy scenario which rules the translocation of ions in the filter @xcite . 
 following @xcite , we will consider the field to be engineered so that the configurations follow @xmath28,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are essentially the amplitudes of the dc and ac parts of the field , respectively , and @xmath31 the angular frequency of the ac part . 
 similar changes in the free energy scenario occur due to long - range coupling mechanisms in response to a perturbation at a large distance in the protein . 
 this is what happens , for instance , in ion pumps due to the binding of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) . 
 the full hamiltonian for the periodically driven selectivity filter is then @xmath32 . and 
 this does not refer to the channel under natural condition but rather to the channel being probed in the patch clamping setup . 
 interaction with the environmental degrees of freedom , especially vibrations of the carbonyl groups of the selectivity filter backbone @xcite , surely induces dephasing noise . in this first treatment of the problem 
 , we will assume the simplest model where this noise is local and memoryless , i.e. , we will use the following lindblad superoperator @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a time independent positive dephasing rate . 
 usually , the drain excitation probability or population is used to quantify transport efficiency in coupled quantum systems @xcite . here , we are interested in the time average of this quantity or current @xmath35 which reads @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the reduced state of the drain which is obtained by tracing out all other sites . 
 both , the concentration dependent and independent paths , appear in the experiments and simulations as pathways connecting site @xmath5 to site @xmath6 , and then contribute to ionic conduction @xcite . in the quantum regime , these different paths may _ compete _ leading to interference effects in the observable current @xmath35 . 
 we now present our findings about the main trends followed by this current . 
 in particular , we investigate a possible quantum advantage of having two conduction paths linking @xmath5 and @xmath6 by comparing the current @xmath35 produced with the topologies shown in figure [ top ] . 
 although we are treating transport in the context of a biological system , it is worthwhile noticing that coupled two - level systems also appears in a great variety of physical scenarios including , for example , quantum dots @xcite and superconducting qubits @xcite . 
 consequently , the results presented here might be of value for quantum technologies using qubits , where our results might even be promptly simulated and experimentally observed @xcite . 
 in this section , we provide a more detailed physical discussion about the choice of parameters used in the simulations presented later on in this work . 
 in particular , we try to predict the order of magnitude of the decoherence rates in order to compare it with estimated frequencies of the system . 
 it is important to remark that our work is based on an _ effective model_. the same is done in recent descriptions of the fmo @xcite . in this case , 
 nonlinear spectroscopy techniques gives direct information on coupling constants and frequencies appearing in an effective description based on the occupation of two - level sites . 
 for the ion channels , however , there is not yet an experimental technique which provides information on the parameters used in effective models . 
 consequently , we have to estimate the order of magnitude of the parameters involved in our model using indirect available experimental data . 
 this is of course not the most suitable scenario to do predictions , but we think that this is not a reason to prevent serious investigations which pave the way for advances and motivate the proposition of new experimental techniques to verify or falsify the findings of the models .    the physical constants should be chosen as to fullfill the expected ( and measured ) current which is transported by the channel under regular conditions , i.e. , @xmath1 ions / sec @xcite . to achieve this 
 , we basically follow the reasoning presented in @xcite . from ( [ hhop ] ) and ( [ hex ] ) , it follows that @xmath29 is the energy difference between the configurations and @xmath24 is the hopping rate between them . 
 let us consider the case @xmath38 . 
 in order to active a transfer rate of @xmath1 ions / sec , perturbation theory tell us that we must have @xmath39ions / sec . on the other hand , this time dependent transport model presents resonances when @xmath40 with @xmath41 integer and @xmath31 the frequency of the drive which appears in ( [ hex ] ) . 
 we will set the system to work near theses resonances . by defining the constant @xmath42 , 
 these conditions are fulfilled by choosing @xmath43 and @xmath44 . 
 for this reason , the simulations are run using @xmath45 and @xmath46 . 
 the incoherent pump and disposal of configurations given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , depend on the specific conditions under which the experiment will be set . 
 it is natural to think them as a monotonic function of the concentration of ions inside and outside the cell , as supposed in @xcite . 
 numerical simulations show that variations of these constants only limit the total current but not its dependence on other parameters . 
 so , it does no harm to fix these constants to be the same order as the rate @xmath1 ions / sec , i.e , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . finally , one have some freedom to set @xmath30 ( the drive amplitude ) at any desired value because it is an externally controlled parameter . 
 since the behavior of the current as a function of @xmath30 consists of a sequence of maxima and minima @xcite , we will set this amplitude such that one has the first minimum of current . 
 this is achieved with @xmath49 .    giving the complexity of the system 
 , it is not easy to anticipate the decoherence rate . 
 for this reason , in the first simulation shown in figure [ fig3 ] , we vary the dephasing rate @xmath50 over a wide range . 
 consequently , we can draw conclusions in regimes such as pure quantum transport ( small decoherence ) and highly classical transport ( massive decoherence ) . in 
 what regime precisely the channel works is a question to be answered experimentally such as happened to some photosyntetic complexes which were shown to keep track of some quantumness due to partial preservation of quantum coherences @xcite . 
 however , it is interesting to see that it is possible , through simplified assumptions , to provide a rough order of magnitude of the dephasing rate . 
 again , we follow the reasoning originally shown in @xcite . one can assume that the dominant form of noise comes from the stretch mode of the carbonyl groups in the ion channel . 
 this naturally changes the width of the wells forming the trap sites , causing the frequency or energy of the stable configurations to fluctuate . 
 the simplified model considering just one trap site and one mode of stretch is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the frequency of ion in the trapping well and @xmath53 is the frequency of the stretch mode . if one consider the transport of ions as a sequence of tunelling events through barriers separating the wells , it is not hard to show that the frequency of motion in each well must be around @xmath54s@xmath55 in order to obtain a tunneling rate of @xmath1 ions / sec , as shown in @xcite . 
 concerning the mode , given its typical high frequency @xmath56s@xmath55 , only the ground state is appreciably populated in room temperature and the corresponding mean square deviation of the position of the oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups is of the order of 0.02@xmath57 . 
 one can then attempt to numerically find the order of magnitude of the fluctuations in @xmath52 induced by oscillations of amplitude 0.02@xmath57 . 
 this fluctuation turns out to be about one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath52 @xcite . 
 consequently , we can roughly consider @xmath58 in ( [ decmodel ] ) 
 .    in the scope of this simplified model , an initial superposition state of the ion such as @xmath59 times the ground state of the mode , would evolve such that after a time @xmath60ns , the fidelity with the initial state will drop to @xmath61 . 
 this suggests a decoherence rate about @xmath62 . 
 therefore , in this crude estimation , one obtains that the dephasing rate @xmath50 is approximatelly one order of magnitude stronger than @xmath63 . 
 but this is not enough to discard the analyses of regimes where @xmath50 is slightly bigger or smaller than @xmath63 . 
 in fact , we will show in next section that the two - path topology is more efficient than the single path one even for high dephasings . as said before , it is likely that only an experiment will be able to precisely determine @xmath50 . in @xcite , it is proposed the use of physiological techniques to experimentally estimate @xmath50 from measurements of current . 
 we first analyze the role of dephasing in the transport , especially in the conduction pathways embodied by sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . 
 it is well known that in the selectivity filter , the configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 have k@xmath0 ions residing near the center of a box formed by eight carbonyl oxygens , while in the intermediate sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 the coordination is reduced to six oxygen atoms , with just four of them provided by the carbonyl groups of the backbone @xcite . since coupling to the stretch mode of the carbonyl groups is expected to be the main cause of decoherence , we expect that the intermediate sites will possess lower decoherence rates . 
 it is then interesting to see whether having less dephasing in the intermediate configurations helps conduction .    in order to investigate this point 
 , we compare both topologies considering fixed dephasing in sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath64 ) , and varying the dephasing @xmath65 in @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath66 ) . 
 the current @xmath67 for this configuration is presented in figure [ fig3 ] , where we subtracted the current @xmath68 which corresponds to the case of invariant dephasing . 
 interestingly enough , it is clear that the two pathway topology benefits from the passing through configurations of reduced dephasing ( @xmath69 ) which is consistent with the fact that the intermediate sites are less coordinated .     obtained by fixing dephasing @xmath70 in sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 and varying @xmath65 which is the dephasing in sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . 
 we subtracted @xmath68 which is the current for equal dephasing in all sites . 
 solid line corresponds to the single - pathway topology and dashed line to the two - pathway . 
 we used @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ] 
 it is import to remark that figure [ fig3 ] does not allow us to decide which topology is best suited for transport for a given value of @xmath50 . 
 it only allows us to evaluate the advantage of having intermediate sites of lower decoherence rates than the binding sites . in figure 
 [ fig4 ] , we address this point by fixing the ration @xmath73 and varying @xmath50 . 
 we show the behavior of the current in the cases where decoherence in the intermediate sites is lower or stronger than in the binding sites . 
 it is now quite clear that , in respect to different decoherence regimes , the two - pathway topology is more likely to bring transport advantages to the channel compared to the linear topology .     obtained by fixing @xmath74 and varying @xmath50 which is the dephasing in sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 . 
 the quantity @xmath65 is the dephasing in the intermediate configurations @xmath20 and @xmath21 . 
 solid line corresponds to the single - pathway topology and dashed line to the two - pathway . 
 ( below ) the same for @xmath75 . 
 solid line corresponds to the single - pathway topology and dashed line to the two - pathway . 
 we used @xmath71 and @xmath72.,title=""fig : "" ]   obtained by fixing @xmath74 and varying @xmath50 which is the dephasing in sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 . 
 the quantity @xmath65 is the dephasing in the intermediate configurations @xmath20 and @xmath21 . 
 solid line corresponds to the single - pathway topology and dashed line to the two - pathway . 
 ( below ) the same for @xmath75 . 
 solid line corresponds to the single - pathway topology and dashed line to the two - pathway . 
 we used @xmath71 and @xmath72.,title=""fig : "" ] ]    in general , for a giving value of the driving field frequency @xmath31 , models such as the one considered here present resonances when varying the driving field amplitude @xmath30 @xcite . in order to gain more information about the advantages of having one or two conduction pathways in the filter , we now study the global maximum of current @xmath76 as a function of @xmath31 . 
 the result is shown in figure 5 . 
 it is now clear that for most cases the two - path topology can offer advantages with and without dephasing i.e. , the range of @xmath31 for which the two - path supersedes the single path is quite wide . 
 the results are actually quite convincing in favor of the two - path topology . 
 let us take the case @xmath77 , for instance . 
 the current with no dephasing using the two - path topology is more than twice the current observed in the single - path topology . 
 this is a clear evidence of constructive quantum interference arising from competing conduction paths . even in the presence of dephasing , 
 the advantage of the two - path topology at @xmath77 is much more pronounced than advantage found with the single - path for small @xmath31 . 
 therefore , having two competing paths of conduction gives in general advantages for the filter , and this might have actually been used by channel to help it operate under a real noisy environment . as a final comment , 
 it is interesting to see that about @xmath78 , dephasing helps conduction in the two - path topology . 
 this is a phenomenon called dephasing - assisted transport in the literature @xcite . the same happens for the single - path topology for @xmath31 bigger than about @xmath79 .     as a function of @xmath31 . 
 squares refer to the case with no dephasing and triangles to dephasing with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . 
 empty shapes in dashed lines refer to the two - path topology and filled shapes in solid lines refer to the linear single - path topology . ] 
 in this work , we presented a simple quantum model which takes into account the most significant features of the kcsa potassium channel . 
 in particular , we included the fact that this system employs two pathways of conduction . from a quantum point of view , this could be a big advantage given that possible constructive interference effects can play a role . 
 we then studied the role played by a second pathway of conduction , and we found that there might be indeed some advantage for the filter to have it . 
 this advantage appears in both the closed system dynamics , which is certainly not the case in real ion channels , and in the open system scenario where system functions . 
 it is important to remark that , from the experimental side , it is still necessary to wait for advances to discover whether or not this system operates in this moderate noisy regime where the two - path topology confers advantages over the single - path . in other words , it is still an open question whether or not quantum coherence is present in this interesting biological system . 
 however , the measure of the current using the scheme proposed in @xcite would be enough to decide on the validity of the model . 
 on the other hand , given that quantum transport is a very important topic for modern technologies , our results may still find applications in a great variety of coupled quantum systems such as arrays of quantum dots , trapped ions , and other systems alike . _

7,"pressure has been recognized as one of the most important parameters in study of condensed matter physics . 
 the pressure effect is studied by a variety of method such as electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , specific heat , x - ray or neutron diffraction , nmr , inelastic neutron scattering and so on . among them 
 high - pressure esr is useful to investigate the pressure effect of the magnetic material from the microscopic point of view . 
 most of the reported high - pressure esr systems @xcite except our and nfrdi s @xcite systems are equipped with resonator and only one frequency is available in principal , while the sensitivity is higher than our systems . 
 exceptionally , a method using the combination of the resonator and the plastic diamond anvil cell has been developed very recently @xcite . in its case , 
 the multifrequency measurement can be done by using the higher resonant modes in addition to the fundamental mode . however , the frequency region is limited in the 40 - 160 ghz frequency region , though the pressure reaches above 2 gpa . nfrdi 
 _ et al . _ 
 whose system is a similar type with us started their development later than us and they have the system with the maximum field up to 16 t , the pressure region up to 1.6 gpa and the frequency region from 105 to 420 ghz @xcite .    on the other hand , in our systems the frequency 
 can be varied very widely , which includs the so - called thz region defined as the frequency region from 0.1 to 10 thz @xcite , since we simply combine the piston - cylinder pressure cells with the transmission - type high - field esr system using the pulsed high magnetic field @xcite or the static magnetic field @xcite . 
 the most characteristic point of our pressure cell is that all inner parts are made of sapphire and zro@xmath0-based ceramic . 
 they have both the toughness and the transmission in the thz region , and this enables us to observe the transmitted light through the pressure cell in the wide frequency region . 
 the energy of the electromagnetic wave in this frequency region matches well the energy between the ground state and the low - lying excited states of the quantum spin systems . 
 therefore , our high - pressure esr systems have proved to be one of the most powerful means to study quantum spin systems @xcite . 
 so far , we developed the pressure cell with the moderate pressure range below 1 gpa and the wide frequency region from 70 to 700 ghz @xcite , and that with the higher pressure range up to 1.5 gpa and the limited frequency region from 70 to 400 ghz @xcite . 
 recently , we also developed a hybrid - type pressure cell with larger sample space and higher pressure region for large bore magnet , which covers the frequency region form 50 to 400 ghz and the pressure up to 2.5 gpa @xcite . in order to achieve the high pressure and the wide frequency region simultaneously , the key factors are the toughness and the transmission property of the inner parts of the pressure cell . in this paper , we describe the survey of several ceramics for the inner parts . on the basis of this survey we tried new ceramic for the inner parts and we succeeded in extending the frequency region up to 700 ghz for the hybrid - type pressure cell . 
 phase diagram for the shastry - sutherland model @xcite . ]    as an application , we show the result of a two - dimensional spin-1/2 dimer system srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . 
 it is well known as a shastry - sutherland model compound which has an orthogonal dimer structure in two - dimensional plane @xcite . 
 it shows a unique temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the ground state is the singlet . from the fitting of this temperature dependence of the susceptibility with the theoretical calculation , 
 the exchange interaction within dimer @xmath2 85 k and that between dimers @xmath3 54 k were estimated @xcite . 
 theoretically , the system is believed to be located near the phase boundary of the ratio @xmath4 between the interdimer and intradimer exchange interactions @xcite as shown in fig . 
 the quantum critical point @xmath5 was @xmath6 and it was considered that there were only two phases of the dimer singlet phase ( @xmath7 ) and the nel phase ( @xmath8 ) at the beginning @xcite . however , recent more detailed calculation for the shastry - sutherland model with the intradimer and interdimer exchange interactions by the series expansions has predicted that there exists an intermediate phase between these two phases @xcite . 
 it is the plaquette singlet phase ( @xmath9 ) as shown in fig . 
 [ phase ] . 
 moreover , the numerical exact diagonalization for the more realistic model with the interdimer dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction in addition to these exchange interactions not only observed the anomaly in the @xmath10 dependence of the gap energy around this predicted critical value @xmath11 but also explained the zero - field splitting of the direct esr transition modes very well @xcite . since the system has the ratio @xmath12 and it lies just below the critical point , it will provide an opportunity to study the quantum critical transition if the ratio can be controlled . 
 this has stimulated the study of the pressure effect on this system . 
 the magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 0.7 gpa suggested the suppression of the gap energy between the ground state and the first excited states with the pressure @xcite , and we revealed the suppression of gap directly up to 1 gpa from the high - pressure esr @xcite . 
 the nmr measurement at 2.4 gpa suggested the existence of the pressure - induced new phase where the magnetic and nonmagnetic sites coexist @xcite . 
 moreover , the x - ray measurement suggested the complete collapse of the gap energy at 2 gpa and the quantum phase transition around at this pressure followed by the appearance of a new phase @xcite . 
 however , the extrapolation of the pressure dependence of gap obtained from our previous esr measurement up to 1 gpa suggested that the gap still remains at 2 gpa @xcite . 
 this fact is pretty controversial with the x - ray study . in this study , we extended the pressure range of the esr measurement of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 above 1.5 gpa successfully and we will show that the gap energy remains open certainly at 2 gpa . 
 all measurements were performed by the recently developed esr system using cryogen - free superconducting magnet @xcite . 
 the maximum magnetic field is 10 t. backward wave oscillators ( bwo ) , which cover the frequency region from 300 to 800 ghz , are used as the light source . 
 the transmitted light trough the sample is detected by insb detector set at the bottom of the light pipe . 
 the output of bwo is chopped mechanically with the frequency of several hundreds hz and the output signal from the detector is amplified by the lock - in amplifier using the chopping frequency as the reference signal . 
 the detailed set up can be seen in ref . 
 21 and 22 . for the transmission measurement of the ceramics , we measured the transmission intensity of the sample by the above setup without field 
 . bwo is controlled by a pc through the ad converter and the frequency sweep measurement can be done . 
 the transmittance can be obtained by dividing the transmission intensity with sample by that without sample . 
 although the output intensity of bwo has large frequency dependence , its reproducibility is high and the reliable transmittance can be obtained if the optical axis is maintained during the sample exchange . 
 the sample ceramic has a cylindrical shape whose diameter and length are 12 mm and 30 mm , respectively . 
 the length corresponds to the total length of the inner parts used in the pressure cell . 
 all transmission measurements have been done at 4.2 k and in the frequency region from 330 to 530 ghz . 
 the high - pressure esr measurements of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 have also been performed by the same setup . 
 the pressure cell including sample is connected to the light pipe so that the sample is located at the center of the magnet . 
 a rectangular shape single crystal @xmath13 mm@xmath14 with its long axis along the @xmath15 axis was used . 
 the esr measurements have been done at 2 k in the frequency region from 300 to 800 ghz . 
 the pressure cell is the hybrid - type piston - cylinder cell . 
 we used the inner parts made of the zro@xmath0-based ceramic and the al@xmath0o@xmath1 ceramic to achieve the transmission and the higher pressure simultaneously as is discribed later . 
 the maximum pressure was 1.51 gpa in this study . 
 the pressure was estimated from the load at room temperature by using the quadratic calibration curve of the load with the pressure around 3 k , which was obtained by the change of the superconducting transition temperature of tin . 
 the detail of the hybrid - type pressure cell can also be seen in ref .

 the details of the examined ceramics are summarized in table [ tab1 ] . ] 
 cross section of the hybrid - type pressure cell @xcite with the inner parts setup for simultaneous achievement of the high pressure and the high transmission . 
 sample is set into a teflon capsule and it is filled with the pressure - transmitting oil ( daphne 7373 in this study ) . ] 
 the requirements for the inner parts of the pressure cell for our esr system are the transmission in the thz region , the toughness , the absence of the magnetic impurity , the commercial availability , and so on . 
 previously , sapphire and the zro@xmath0-based ceramic fcy20a were used mainly as the inner parts material . 
 the sapphire has very high transmission and we can obtain the wide frequency region up to 700 ghz . 
 however , it does not have enough toughness and it is easily damaged . 
 when all inner parts are made of sapphire , the maximum pressure is 0.3 gpa at most . and it does not reach 1 gpa even if several parts are replaced by that made of the tougher zro@xmath0-based ceramic @xcite . on the other hand , the zro@xmath0-based ceramic has very high toughness and it is much cheaper than sapphire . 
 however , the zro@xmath0-based ceramic does not have enough transmission especially for the higher frequency region @xcite . in order to achieve the higher pressure and the wider frequency measurement simultaneously , finding 
 a new material for the inner parts is an important factor . 
 the zro@xmath0-based ceramic , which is known as the partially stabilized zirconia , is believed to have particular fracture toughness as compared with other ceramics in general . 
 table [ tab1 ] shows the examined ceramics in this study . 
 all ceramics except fca10 are the zro@xmath0-based ceramic and fca10 is made of only al@xmath0o@xmath1 . in this table 
 the main components , their contents and the fracture toughness values @xmath16 are also shown , which are extracted from their data sheets . 
 figure [ fig1 ] shows the frequency dependence of the transmittance of these ceramics . 
 all data are fitted well by a function @xmath22 , where @xmath15 and @xmath23 are the fitting parameter , and @xmath24 is the frequency . 
 the obtained parameter @xmath23 is also listed in table [ tab1 ] . as is seen clearly in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] and the obtained parameter @xmath23 in table [ tab1 ] , the transmittance has large component dependence . 
 first , we focus on the difference of the transmittance for the series of fca10 , fcy40a and fcy20a , which have different al@xmath0o@xmath1 contents and they are 100 , 40 and 20 , respectively , as shown by open symbols in fig . 
 fca10 shows the highest transmission among the examined ceramics and also shows little frequency dependence . 
 however , the transmittance is decreased as the al@xmath0o@xmath1 content is decreased . 
 moreover , the decrease of the transmittance with the frequency is remarkable as shown in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] , which is also apparent in the fitting parameter @xmath23 shown in table [ tab1 ] . 
 this fact suggests that zro@xmath0 has higher absorption in this frequency region than al@xmath0o@xmath1 . 
 we consider that zro@xmath0 has the larger dielectric loss as compared with al@xmath0o@xmath1 in this frequency region and/or the peak frequency of the dielectric loss for zro@xmath0 is lower than that of al@xmath0o@xmath1 . 
 next , from the comparison of fcy40a and z206n , whose admixture is y@xmath0o@xmath1 , it was found that they have almost the same transmittance in spite of the amount of zro@xmath0 , where the zro@xmath0 content is 60 % for fcy20a and 95 % for z206n . 
 moreover , from the comparison of z206n and z201n , the higher transmittance in z206n can be seen , though the zro@xmath0 content in z206n is higher than z201n . 
 this fact may suggest that there exist other factors for the absorption of the electromagnetic wave in addition to the amount of zro@xmath0 
 . they might be the admixture itself , the vacancy whose species and amount probably depend on the manufacturing process sensitively , admixtures which are not disclosed , and so on . 
 the transmittance of z220 , whose admixture is mgo , is extremely low as compared with that of z206n , which has almost the same amount of zro@xmath0 with z220 . from this comparison , it is also suggested that the transmittance is very sensitive to the admixture . 
 it was also found that there is tradeoff tendency between the fracture toughness and the transmittance in thz region . 
 that is , the tougher material tends to have the lower transmittance . 
 the most balanced one is z206n or fcy20a . 
 consequently , the currently used fcy20a turned out to be one of the most balanced ceramics . 
 moreover , fcy20a is easier to obtain commercially . 
 figure [ pcell ] shows the cross section of the hybrid - type pressure cell for esr measurement @xcite . 
 it was confirmed that the pressure can be generated up to 2.5 gpa when fcy20a is used as the inner parts material @xcite . 
 however , the frequency region is limited up to 400 ghz practically @xcite 
 . therefore , at this moment we have to replace one or two of the inner parts with other ceramic to have better transmission to widen the frequency region at the cost of the pressure . 
 figure [ pcell ] shows a setup for the simultaneous achievement of the high pressure and the high transmission . 
 when two pistons are replaced by those made of fca10 , which has the highest transmission among the examined ceramics , we confirmed that the maximum pressure reaches 1.5 gpa and the frequency region can be extended up to 700 ghz successfully @xcite . 
 simaltaneous achievement of the pressure up to 1.5 gpa and the frequency region up to 700 ghz has never been done in the previous systems and it is very useful to study quantum spin systems as shown in the next section . 
 frequency dependence esr spectra of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 obtained at 1.51 gpa and 2 k for h@xmath25a . 
 the inset shows the energy - field diagram for an isolated dimer system . here 
 @xmath26 is the magnetic permeability of free space . ]    in this section we will show the result of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 as an application of our high - pressure esr system . 
 srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 has the alternate stacking of cubo@xmath1 layer and sr layer along the @xmath27 axis . 
 the magnetic ion is cu@xmath28 ion ( @xmath29 ) . 
 it forms the planar tetracoordinated cuo@xmath30 with the o ions and the cuo@xmath30 forms the cu@xmath0o@xmath31 dimer by edge - sharing . 
 the dimers are connected orthogonally through bo@xmath1 and they form the unique two - dimensional network in @xmath32 plane . 
 figure [ nama ] shows the frequency dependence esr spectra obtained at the maximum pressure of 1.51 gpa in this study for the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath15 axis . as is indicated by triangle symbols , 
 the absorption lines were observed clearly in very wide frequency region . 
 we observed two kinds of signals , one is that shifts to the lower field side and another is that shifts to the higher field side with increasing frequency . in the inset of fig . 
 [ nama ] the energy - field diagram of an isolated dimer with the singlet ground state @xmath33 and the triplet excited states @xmath34 is shown . 
 the absorption lines showing the lower field side shift with the frequency and those showing the higher field side shift are assigned to the transitions from the @xmath33 to the @xmath35 state and the @xmath36 state , respectively . 
 although such direct transition between the different spin quantum number states is generally forbidden , it becomes allowed when there exists an interaction which mixes these states . in this case , the dm interaction is considered to be responsible for this mixing @xcite , which is given as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dm interaction between @xmath39-th and @xmath40-th spins , and @xmath41 is spin operator at @xmath39-th site . 
 as there is no inversion symmetry between interdimer cu ions , the dm interaction exists between these ions . 
 moreover , the @xmath42 vector is considered to be almost along the @xmath27 axis from the symmetry . 
 the existence of the in - plane component of the interdimer dm interaction and the intradimer dm interaction can be allowed because of the small buckling of the cuo@xmath30 plane . however 
 , these components are expected to be much smaller than that along the @xmath27 axis of the interdimer dm interaction @xcite .    at 299 ghz a sharp signal indicated by arrow was observed . 
 this signal has the @xmath43-value of about 2 and it was found that it is caused by the magnetic impurity of the al@xmath0o@xmath1 inner part of the pressure cell . 
 when esr signal , whose @xmath43-value is different from 2 , is observed , the impurity signal does not overlap the esr signal as is in this case . 
 however , in many cases such magnetic impurity may hide an intrinsic esr signal . 
 further research is required for a material which does not have the magnetic impurity in addition to the acceptable transmittance in thz region and the proper toughness .

 pressure dependence of the half value of the splitting between the upper and lower branches at zero field . 
 see text for the explanation of the solid line . ]    in fig . 
 [ fh ] the resonance fields obtained at various pressures are summarized in the frequency - field diagram . 
 it is worth noting that such esr mode can be obtained by only our high - pressur and multifrequency esr system in thz region . 
 it is clearly shown that both the upper branch and the lower branch shift to the lower energy side as the pressure is increased . 
 it means that the energy gap between the singlet and the triplet states is suppressed by the pressure . 
 it is also found that the frequency - field diagram obtained in this study differs from the simple diagram as shown in the inset of fig . 
 the obtained frequency - field diagram shows the splitting at zero field and this causes the deviation from the linear field dependence of @xmath44 around zero field , where @xmath45 is the bohr magneton . 
 these field dependences are fitted well by the following equation @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath24 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the planck constant , frequency , gap energy and the half value of the splitting between upper and lower branch at zero field , respectively . 
 this equation has the same formula with that obtained theoretically by taking the dm interaction into account , in which @xmath49 in eq . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) can be replaced with @xmath50 at the limit of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the interdimer dm interaction along the @xmath27 axis @xcite . 
 this means that the splitting at zero field is caused by the dm interaction . 
 however , when @xmath10 is apart from 0 the relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath52 is no longer simple like @xmath53 and it depends on @xmath10 . the field range up to 10 t is not enough to evaluate the correct @xmath43-value and the data at the higher field side is required . 
 therefore , the @xmath43-value is assumed to be @xmath54 regardless of the pressure . 
 this @xmath43-value was obtained at the paramagnetic state by nojiri _ 
 and it was confirmed that it almost corresponds to that obtained from the slopes of the direct esr transition modes in the high field @xcite . 
 the curves in fig . 
 [ fh ] are the fitting results . 
 the lines coincides with the obtained data very well . 
 the energy gap and the splitting at zero field obtained from this fitting are plotted as a function of pressure in fig . 
 [ gp ] and [ dm ] , respectively . in fig . 
 [ gp ] the present obtained results , the fitted line to them , and the previous result @xcite are shown . 
 the previous result is consistent with the data in this study . 
 the gap energies are obtained on average to be @xmath55 k at ambient pressure and @xmath56 k at 1.51 gpa , where the subscripts 0 and @xmath57 indicate hereafter the values obtained at ambient pressure and 1.51 gpa , respectively . as is clearly seen in fig . 
 [ gp ] , the gap energy is reduced as the pressure is increased . moreover , it is found that it is reduced linearly with the pressure and there is no anomaly within the measured pressure range . 
 we found that the gap energy closes at 4.6 gpa from the linear extrapolation to the zero gap energy . 
 figure [ dm ] shows the pressure dependence of the splitting at zero field . 
 the scattering of the data is due to the lack of enough data around zero field to determine these values . 
 there are three unknown parameters of @xmath58 , @xmath10 and @xmath52 while we obtained only two parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 from our experiments . 
 moreover , there has been no estimation of these parameters under pressure so far . 
 therefore , an assumption is required to determine these parameters . 
 we assume that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath59 k is constant under the pressure for simplicity . 
 this assumption seems natural because the ions are more closely packed in the cu@xmath0o@xmath31 unit in which the intradimer exchange interaction works between the cu atoms through the o atoms and this unit is much stabler than the linkage between interdimer cu atoms . on the other hand , the linkage between interdimer cu atoms seems to shrink more easily by the pressure and the increase of the interdimer exchange interaction is expected under the pressure . 
 _ studied the shastry - sutherland lattice with the interdimer @xmath60 vector of dm interaction along the @xmath27 axis by the exact numerical diagonalization @xcite . 
 they obtained the relationship between the normalized gap energy @xmath61 and @xmath10 and it shows monotonous decrease with increasing @xmath10 up to the critical value . 
 that is , the decrease of the gap energy shown in fig . 
 [ gp ] means the increase of the ratio @xmath10 by the pressure under the assumption that @xmath58 is constant . 
 then , we can estimate @xmath62 and @xmath63 by comparing our results in fig . 
 [ gp ] with the calculated @xmath10 dependence of @xmath61 . from our results 
 we obtained the normalized gap energy of @xmath64 at ambient pressure and @xmath65 at 1.51 gpa , and the corresponding @xmath62 and @xmath63 are found to be @xmath66 and @xmath67 by reading the result of calculated @xmath10 dependence of @xmath61 in ref . 28 . as a result 
 , the interdimer exchange interaction is increased by the pressure from @xmath68 k at ambient pressure to @xmath69 k at 1.51 gpa . 
 moreover , it was found that the interdimer exchange interaction at ambient pressure of 54 k coincides with the theoretically obtained value completely @xcite . 
 we can conclude that the ratio @xmath10 and the interdimer exchange interaction @xmath70 are increased by the pressure under the assumption that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 is constant . 
 cpas _ et al . 
 _ also obtained the relationship between the normalized splitting at zero field @xmath71 and @xmath10 @xcite . 
 although it is difficult to determine the proper splitting value @xmath49 from fig . 
 [ dm ] especially in the higher pressure region because it does not have enough accuracy , at ambient pressure the splitting @xmath72 can be obtained relatively accurately as shown in fig . 
 it is obtained as @xmath73 k on average . from the calculated @xmath10 dependence of @xmath71 at ambient pressure @xmath66 , 
 it can be read as @xmath74 @xcite . 
 therefore , the dm interaction is determined to be @xmath75 k at ambient pressure and this value is very consistent with that obtained by cpas _ 
 et al . _ @xmath76 k @xcite . 
 since the dm interaction is considered to scale the interdimer interaction @xmath70 , we can evaluate the dm interaction at 1.51 gpa as @xmath77 k. from the calculated @xmath10 dependence of @xmath71 , it is also found to be @xmath78 @xcite . 
 then , the value of @xmath79 at 1.51 gpa is expected to decrease to @xmath80 k. the change of @xmath49 from @xmath73 k at ambient pressure to @xmath81 k at 1.51 gpa is shown in fig . 
 [ dm ] by the straight line and this line lies within the error bar . 
 it means that the above estimation is consistent under the assumption that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 is constant . in order to determine the dm interaction more directly , 
 further precise and detailed high - pressure esr measurement is required . 
 there are a few reports on the crystal structure under the pressure @xcite . 
 they revealed that the lattice constant in the @xmath32 plane is reduced isotropically and the structural phase transition to the monoclinic phase occurs at around 5 gpa . 
 the reduction of the lattice constant in the @xmath32 plane agrees with the result of the increase of the interdimer exchange interaction @xmath70 . 
 however , the changes of the cu - o - cu angle in the cu@xmath0o@xmath31 plane and the degree of the buckling of cu@xmath0o@xmath31 plane under the pressure were not clarified , which are strongly correlated with the change of the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 . the investigation of these detailed structural changes are needed to verify the assumption that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 is constant . 
 we found that the ratio @xmath10 is increased by the pressure from 0.64 at ambient pressure to 0.68 at 1.51 gpa and it almost reaches the critical value of @xmath82 ( see fig . 
 [ phase ] ) at this maximum pressure in this study . 
 however , no anomaly in esr suggestive of the phase transition was observed at 1.51 gpa . 
 this fact may suggest that there are certain parameters which are not taken into account in the model hamiltonian to obtain the phase diagram . 
 one of them is the exchange interaction between the layers along the @xmath27 axis . from the x - ray measurement 
 it was revealed that the decreasing rate along the @xmath27 axis is the highest among three axes @xcite . 
 although the exchange interaction between layers is small enough ( 8 k ) at ambient pressure @xcite , the system may not be described by the simple two dimensional network as the inter layer exchange interaction is increased under the pressure . 
 further theoretical study which considers the effect of the inter layer exchange interaction is required . 
 finally , we comment on the x - ray measurement under pressure for this compound @xcite . since we found that the system approaches the phase boundary at 1.51 gpa from the above estimation , the transition around 2 gpa suggested by the x - ray measurement is very plausible . 
 in contrast to this suggestion , however , it is very natural that the gap energy remains open at 2 gpa from fig . 
 [ gp ] . in the x - ray measurement , strong spin - lattice coupling 
 is utilized to evaluate the gap energy . 
 that is , the lattice expansion was observed as the temperature was decreased . 
 moreover , the temperature dependence of the reciprocal of the lattice constant scales the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility . 
 then , from the fitting to this temperature dependence of the inverse lattice constant by the simple exponential form exp@xmath83 the gap energy was obtained . 
 this is not direct method to evaluate the gap energy and the fitting of the simple exponential form to the susceptibility is not very precise to estimate the gap energy . on the other hand , 
 the gap energy was directly determined in our high pressure esr measurement and it is more reliable . in x - ray measurement the linear pressure dependence of the gap energy 
 was also found but the slope ( -14.7 k / gpa ) @xcite was much larger than that obtained in this study ( -7.5 k / gpa ) . moreover , the above speculation that the gap energy remains open at the critical value is consistent with the suggestion that the phase transition from the dimer singlet phase to the plaquette singlet phase occurs with remaining the gap open @xcite . the direct observation around 2 gpa by the high pressure esr measurement is highly desired . 
 we investigated the zro@xmath0-based ceramics for the inner parts of the transmission - type pressure cell used in the high - pressure and multifrequency esr system . the zro@xmath0-al@xmath0o@xmath1-based ceramics fcy20a turned out to be one of the most balanced ceramics among the examined ceramics in the toughness , transmission property in thz region and the commercial availability . by using the inner parts made of only al@xmath0o@xmath1 ceramic which has the lowest toughness but the highest transmission together with fcy20a 
 , we successfully reached the pressure of 1.5 gpa and extended the frequency region to 700 ghz simultaneously . 
 we performed the high - pressure esr measurement of the shastry - sutherland compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . 
 we succeeded in observing the direct esr transition mode between the singlet ground state and the triplet excited states up to 1.51 gpa . 
 the precise pressure dependence of the gap energy was obtained directly and it was proved that the gap energy is reduced by the pressure linearly . moreover , 
 the deviation of the direct esr transition mode from the linear field dependence around zero field and the splitting between the upper and lower branches at zero field are clarified by the multifrequency esr measurement in the wide range . from the comparison of the obtained pressure dependence of the gap energy with the theoretical result obtained by cpas _ 
 @xcite , it was found that the ratio of the exchange interactions @xmath10 and the interdimer exchange interaction @xmath70 are increased by the pressure under the assumption that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 is constant . 
 moreover , the ratio @xmath10 reaches 0.68 at 1.51 gpa and it was suggested that the system approaches the quantum critical point . 
 the dm interaction was also suggested to increase by the pressure and this is consistent with the result of the pressure dependence of the splitting value at zero field .      00 for a review , sakurai , t. ; fujimoto , k. ; goto , r. ; okubo , s. ; ohta , h. ; uwatoko , y. development of high - pressure and high - field esr system using squid magnetometer .

8,"even a quick look at the set of known proteins ( pdb database ) reveals a striking feature . while there are tens of thousands of protein sequences , they only assume some thousands folds . in other words , proteins are highly designable . 
 this concept can be quantified by measuring the number of sequences that fold uniquely into a particular structure .    with the use of a simple 20 letter lattice model @xcite of protein folding it 
 has been shown @xcite that the whole issue of estimating the number @xmath0 of sequences that fold to the same conformation is reduced to enumerate how many of them have native energy lying below a threshold @xmath1 , the energy which any sequence with the same composition displays in the conformation structurally dissimilar to the native conformation @xcite . 
 the aim of the present paper is to provide a reliable , analytic expression for @xmath0 , which we shall show increases exponentially with the gap @xmath2 between the native energy of the optimal sequence @xmath3 and the threshold energy @xmath1 . 
 this functional form is found to be universal , as it emerges from the central limit theorem . 
 we have furthermore found that while the parameters defining @xmath0 depend on the interaction matrix , they are independent of the particular choice made for the native structure or for the optimal sequence .    in sections 2 and 3 we briefly review the 20 letters lattice model of proteins in general and the question of protein designability in particular . 
 the quantitative , analytic answer to the question of how many mutations a designed protein tolerates is given in section 4 . 
 the conclusions are collected in section 5 . 
 a useful theoretical approach to study protein folding is provided by a simplified lattice model , where the protein is a string of beads that is arranged on a cubic lattice @xcite . 
 the configurational energy of a chain of n monomers is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective interaction potential between monomers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote their lattice positions and @xmath10 is the contact function . in eq . 
 ( 1 ) the pairwise interaction is different from zero when @xmath11 and @xmath12 occupy nearest  neighbour sites , i.e. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 indicates the step length of the lattice . 
 in addition to these interactions , it is assumed that on  site repulsive forces prevent two amino acids to occupy the same site simultaneously , so that @xmath17 . 
 we shall consider throughout a 20letters representation of protein sequence where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix . 
 a possible realization of this matrix is given in ref . 
 @xcite ( table 5 and 6 ) , where it was derived from frequencies of contacts between different amino acids in protein structures . 
 the employment of a @xmath19 matrix ensures that the threshold energy @xmath1 is well defined , depending only on the interaction matrix elements and on the composition of the protein in terms of amino acids . 
 the model we study here is a generic heteropolymer model which has been shown to reproduce important generic features of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics , independent on the particular potential chosen @xcite . 
 however , in using such an approach , one should keep in mind that the labelling of amino acids ( spherical beads all of the same size and with no side chain ) is generic too and may be no obvious relation between those labels and labels for real amino acids . 
 good  folder sequences are characterized by a large gap @xmath20 ( compared to the standard deviation @xmath21 of the contact energies ) between the energy of the designed sequence in the native conformation @xmath3 , and the lowest energy of the conformations structurally dissimilar to the native conformation @xcite . in other words , 
 good folders are associated with a normalized gap @xmath22 , quantity closely related to the z  score @xcite . 
 for example , the 36mer sequence listed in the caption to fig . 1 and called s@xmath23 in the literature @xcite , designed by minimizing the energy in the target ( native ) conformation with respect to amino acid sequence for fixed composition has , in the units considered here ( @xmath24 @xcite ) , an energy gap @xmath25 and thus a sufficiently large value of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) so as to ensure fast folding . 
 in fact , monte carlo simulations carried out at the temperature @xmath28 of 3000 36mers with energies , in the native conformation , lying inside the gap fold in times @xmath29 mc steps @xcite ( for caveats see ref . 
 @xcite ) . in particular 
 s@xmath23 folds in @xmath30 mc steps . 
 it has been also shown that most of the thermodynamical @xcite and dynamical @xcite behaviour of designed proteins is controlled by only @xmath31 of the sites . as a consequence , making mutations in these sites , which are called `` hot '' in ref . 
 @xcite , one destroys , as a rule , the ability the protein has to fold ( denaturation ) . on the other hand , 
 the effects of substitutions in any other site ( that can be regarded as `` cold '' ) are small , leading to neutral mutations . 
 while twenty letters heteropolymers capture the essential components of real proteins , it is hardly possible to enumerate all sequences which have a given conformation as their non  degenerate ground state . 
 accordingly , it is not possible to calculate the exact designability of protein conformations . to bypass this problem 
 , we shall determine designability from energetic considerations , using a strategy which relies on the fact that all sequences which have an energy lower than @xmath1 fold on short call , in any case in times which are much shorter than that associated with the random search @xcite . 
 any sequence of a given length @xmath32 ( e.g. @xmath33 ) can be obtained making @xmath34 mutations ( i.e. substitution of a amino acid in a given site with a different one ) in the minimum energy sequence ( e.g. s@xmath23 in the case of fig . 
 1(a ) ) . consequently 
 , the designability of a conformation can be found starting from the minimum energy sequence , counting how many mutations lay within the gap @xmath20 . 
 if @xmath35 is the change in the energy of the native state produced by a mutation , @xmath36 the energy distribution probability associated with @xmath37 mutations and @xmath38 the total number of sequences that can be produced by introducing @xmath37 mutations in the minimum energy sequence , designability can be defined as @xmath39 so far , we have done nothing more than expressing the problem in another way , since to know the spectrum of mutation energies of the optimal sequence one has again to enumerate all sequences . 
 in fact , it looks like as if we have made things even worse , in that now one has to find the optimal sequence , which is a non  trivial problem , and also has to ensure that @xmath1 does not change with mutations . 
 we shall show in the following that the distribution of mutation energies does not depend on the particular structure or on the particular sequence chosen ( provided that @xmath40 ) nor on the contact energy matrix used to design the protein , but only on its composition and on the number of contacts ( or the length , if it is fully compact ) . 
 this observation leaves room to approximations . 
 in fact , if one is able to find an approximate expression for @xmath41 , such an expression will hold for all model proteins of the same length . 
 furthermore , the knowledge of the sequence associated with the global minimum of energy @xmath42 is not necessary ( because all sequences have the same spectrum of mutations ) , only the value of @xmath3 is required . 
 consequently , even if the optimal sequence can not be known without a full enumeration of all sequences , it is allowed to use any other sequence with energy @xmath43 , introducing in this way only an error in the integration boundaries ( and not on the function to be integrated ) . 
 it is then possible to calculate designability of a structure from eq . 
 ( 23 ) using an approximate distribution @xmath41 and an approximate value of @xmath2 . 
 the most conservative way to calculate the number of sequences which fold to a conformation is then to use a distribution @xmath36 found only by swappings between the residues of the optimal sequence , as in such a way the composition is conserved and @xmath1 does not change . on the other hand , 
 since there are also sequences with different composition folding to the same conformation , one is also forced , in principle , to calculate the number @xmath0 associated with pointlike mutations . 
 the values found from swapping of amino acids and from pointlike mutations can be viewed as the lower and the upper limit to designability , respectively .    in figs . 
 2(a ) and 2(b ) we display the unnormalized energy distribution probabilities associated with two composition  conserving and with two pointlike mutations of s@xmath23 ( the integral of these distributions being the total number of sequences ) . 
 each of these curves can be well fitted by the sum of two gaussians , whose means are @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( fig . 
 2(a ) , composition conserving case ) and @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( fig . 
 2(b ) , pointlike mutations case ) . 
 standard deviations are @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( fig . 
 2(a ) ) and @xmath48 and @xmath50 ( fig . 2(b ) ) . 
 the behaviour of these two distributions seems very alike , except for the fact that the area below the composition  conserving curve is much smaller than that below the pointlike mutations curve . 
 this is because much fewer mutations can be made in the first than in the second case and , consequently , the associated gaussian behaviour is less well defined .    the overall structure of the curves shown in fig . 
 2 can be understood from the fact that the average value of @xmath35 for `` cold '' sites is @xmath51 and for `` hot '' sites is @xmath52 @xcite . 
 accordingly , the low  energy peak can be associated with two mutations in `` cold '' sites , while the high  energy peak can be associated with a mutation in a `` cold '' site and a mutation in a `` hot '' site . 
 the contribution from mutations in two `` hot '' sites leads to an enhancement of the high energy tail of the curve . concerning the gaussian behaviour 
 , we note that the energies associated with the 19 possible mutations on a given `` cold '' site are uncorrelated . 
 in other words , one has to pay an energy @xmath53 ( concerning the factor @xmath54 one is reminded of the fact that @xmath55 gets contributions from two mutations ) to remove the wild  type residue , reflecting the fact that it has been optimized . 
 second , one has to introduce a new residue in the _ niche _ left by the wild  type residue . 
 the gaussian shape of the distribution suggests that the _ niche _ is neutral with respect to the new residue and that the new interactions are merely random . to be more precise , the change in energy @xmath35 upon mutations is the difference between the energy needed to remove the original residue ( which is roughly constant and assumes two different values for cold and for hot sites ) and the sum of a number of contact energies associated with the new residue , energies which can be considered as random numbers . 
 being the sum of random numbers , the energy associated with the new residue is forced to respect the central limit theorem , and consequently its distribution approaches a gaussian function . 
 of course , an exact gaussian distribution could be reached only if the number of nearest neighbours of each site were infinite ( while in a cubic lattice this is , at most , five ) . on the other hand , the fact that @xmath36 can be accurately fitted by gaussian distributions ( cf . 
 , e.g. , fig . 
 2(b ) ) testifies to the fact that we are not far from the conditions in which the central limit theorem holds .    while the hypothesis that `` cold '' mutations give raise to gaussian  like peaks is quite grounded , due to the uncorrelateness of the energy contributions of `` cold '' sites , it is unlikely that the central limit theorem works properly for `` hot '' sites , whose energy contributions are correlated @xcite . in order to calculate the degree of designability of a protein conformation 
 , we only need to know the contributions from cold sites and , consequently , we don not need to better characterize the peaks associated to `` hot '' sites .    we have found that the distribution of mutation energies are rather universal functions . 
 examples of such a behaviour are shown in fig . 
 3 , where 2pointlikes mutations spectra @xmath56 associated with low energy 36mer sequences optimized ( making use of the mj elements of table 6 ) on three different conformation ( cf . figs . 
 1(a)1(c ) ) and with three sequences designed on the same conformation ( fig . 
 1(a ) ) are displayed . 
 similar results have been obtained for chains of different lengths . 
 furthermore , using different @xmath19 interaction matrices lead to the same gaussian behaviour of @xmath56 , although the mean values and the standard deviations are different . 
 this is again a consequence of the central limit theorem . 
 this can be seen from fig . 
 4 , where we display the function @xmath56 associated with two pointlike mutations on s@xmath23 ( cf . 
 1 ) , but making use this time of the interaction matrix elements listed in table 5 of ref . @xcite . because the average change in energy upon mutations in cold sites is zero , 
 while that in hot sites is @xmath57 , it is easy to identify the peaks associated with two cold mutations ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , with one cold and one hot mutations ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , and with two hot mutations ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .    summing up , the function @xmath56 associated with chains of different length and sequence as well as designed on different native conformations overlap quite nicely , suggesting that the spectrum of both composition conserving and non  conserving mutations is universal . on the other hand , the actual value of @xmath55 and @xmath64 characterizing the different peaks of the energy distribution probability depend on the matrix used to describe the contact energies among the amino acids . 
 the univerality of the energy distribution probability is in agreement with the interpretation of the main peaks of the spectrum of mutations of a designed protein in term of `` cold '' and `` hot '' sites . 
 in fact , the properties of the `` hot '' sites are rather homogeneous , their contribution to the mutation spectrum being universal . assuming furthermore that the interactions associated to the mutations in `` cold '' sites are random 
 , the resulting energy distribution is gaussian ( and so universal ) , and its standard deviation depends only on the interaction matrix , while its average value depends on the degree of optimization of the wild  type monomer . 
 this , in turn , can be approximated by the degree of optimization of the whole chain ( measured by the energy gap @xmath2 ) divided by its length , a quantity which is essentially constant for long chains @xcite ( for example , in the case of s@xmath23 this number is @xmath65 ) . 
 the basic idea to calculate the designability of a model protein , as we have discussed above , is to find a simple approximation to the universal distribution of energies associated with mutations onto the optimal sequence , integrate this distribution up to the gap @xmath2 and normalize this result to the total number of mutations that one can make ( cf . 
 ( 23 ) ) . as a consequence of this 
 , designability turns out to depend only on the length of the protein ( through the total number of mutations ) and on the gap @xmath2 . in order to calculate @xmath0 using eq . 
 ( 23 ) we have first to know the total number @xmath38 of sequences that can be obtained by making @xmath37 sequence  conserving mutations ( swappings ) in the optimal sequence . 
 this number can be obtained by counting the number of ways one can select @xmath37 sites , multiplied by the number of permutations of these sites which move all the @xmath37 residues . 
 that is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of ways one can permute m sites in such a way that only @xmath11 positions are kept fixed . from the relation 
 @xmath68 it is possible to extract the expression for @xmath69 , @xmath70 for large @xmath37 , one can use the stirling approximation for the factorials in eqs . 
 ( 46 ) , and keep only the largest exponent term in the sum ( saddle point approximation ) , obtaining @xmath71 . 
 the constant @xmath72 can be determined from the relation @xmath73 , which for @xmath33 leads to @xmath74 .    to proceed further in the calculation of @xmath0 
 , one needs to find a simple approximation to @xmath36 . for this purpose 
 , we shall express the energy distribution of an arbitrary number of mutations as a convolution of functions @xmath56 associated with the swapping of two amino acids . 
 the validity of this approximation rests on the ansatz that every couple of mutations affect the energy of the native state independently of the other couple of mutations . 
 this approximation is expected to work also for large values of @xmath37 , where the probability of mutating neighbouring sites is not negligible , because the contact energy associated with the mutated residues are in any case random quantities with average zero ( cf . 
 the discussion in the previous section ) . within this scenario , 
 the number of folding sequences displaying @xmath75 mutations and whose energy in the native conformation lies inside the energy gap can be written as @xmath76 making use of the energy distribution probability associated with an amino acid swapping ( composition conserving mutations ) or with two point  like mutations ( composition non  conserving mutations ) one obtains the lower and the upper limit of the designability of a conformation .    in what follows 
 we shall essentially discuss the case of composition conserving mutations . if @xmath2 is lower than the peak associated with mutations in `` hot '' sites ( as in the case of the sequence s@xmath23 where @xmath25 , cf . 
 2 ) , one should convolute only the peak of @xmath56 associated with mutations in `` cold '' sites @xcite . exploiting the fact that the convolution of @xmath37 gaussian distributions , of the form @xmath77 is a gaussian distribution with average @xmath78 and standard deviation @xmath79 , 
 it is possible to write @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( in the case of s@xmath23 this condition means @xmath82 ) one can neglect the first exponential factor in the integral , in which case the integration can be carried out analytically , leading to @xmath83 - 1\right ) \label{eq6}\ ] ] where the substitution @xmath84 has been made . 
 this equation tells us that designability increases exponentially with the gap @xmath2 . in other words , 
 the number of sequences folding to a ( compact ) conformation is determined only by the gap associated with the minimum energy sequence . 
 we have shown that the concepts of designability ( i.e. number of sequences folding to a given conformation ) and foldability ( i.e. , thermodinamical stability of the sequences with low energy on the given conformation , expressed by the gap @xmath2 ) are intimately connected by eq . 
 ( [ eq6 ] ) . if a protein is stable in its native conformation , such native conformation is necessarilly highly designable . 
 vice versa , if a conformation is highly designable , there exist sequences with a large gap folding to it .    to give a numerical evaluation of protein conformations , we make use of eq . 
 ( [ eq5 ] ) ) in the form @xmath85,\ ] ] where @xmath86 does not depend on @xmath37 and , for the case of the structure displayed in fig . 
 1(a ) , assumes the value @xmath87 ( in keeping with the fact that @xmath25 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) . in the case in which @xmath90 , which in the case of the 36mer under discussion implies @xmath91 , one can keep only the largest term in the above sum . within this approximation one can write @xmath92 , a number to be compared with @xmath93 . 
 one can mention , for the sake of completeness , that the number of sequences within the gap obtained by pointlike mutations ( which is the upper limit to designability ) , is well fitted by the function @xmath94 , while the total number of sequences is @xmath95 . 
 the degree of designability of a given conformation depends exponentially on the energy gap @xmath2 . 
 since the number of folding sequences is given by the integral of a universal function ( the mutation energy distribution ) carried up to @xmath2 , a quantity which also determines the thermal stability of the designed protein , one can conclude that designability and thermal stability are strongly interconnected . 
 in other words , sequences displaying large gaps are both thermally stable and highly designable . even sequences displaying , in the native conformation , a small gap fold on short call and share ( in the compaction process ) the conserved contacts leading to local elementary structures and to the ( post  critical ) folding nucleus @xcite . 
 consequently , it is possible to obtain from them , through composition  conserving mutations , other sequences folding to the same native conformation and displaying a large gap . in other words , 
 any sequence able to fold fast , folds to a highly designable conformation . 
 we have estimated that there are of the order of @xmath96 sequences folding to a compact 36mer conformation , over a total of @xmath97 . 
 this is only the lower limit , but let us assume that it describes well the typical degree of designability of the designed protein . 
 is this number small or big ? 
 the answer to this question has , of course , important implications from the evolutionary point of view . if good folders were distributed homogeneously in the space of sequences ( like in the case of rna @xcite ) the important parameter would be their density , that is @xmath98 . 
 this number would be very low , preventing sequences from moving along neutral pathways ( which are collections of sequences folding to the same conformation and differing by single mutations ) . 
 such a scenario is very unfavourable for evolution . 
 the situation is however quite different for proteins . 
 in fact , it has been shown @xcite that good folders group themselves in clusters and superclusters , giving rise to a quite an inhomogeneous landscape . 
 consequently , the relevant parameter which measures the designability of a conformation is the total number of sequences which conserve , in any way , the energy gap . 
 this number ( @xmath99 ) is very large in particular in keeping with the fact that over a life span of the order of 60 mutations occur in the genome of each person @xcite ) .

 ( in press ) strictly speaking , the monte carlo algorithm was to designed to study equilibrium properties of systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite . 
 nonetheless , it has been shown @xcite that , being equivalent to solving the fokker 
 planck equation for diffusion in a potential , it can be helpful also in studying the kinetical properties of complex systems , provided that the fokker 
 planck approximation is valid ( i.e. , moves are local and the potential changes smoothly on the diffusion lenght scale ) .

9,"the generalized einstein - maxwell theories have received a lot of attention recently because it contains higher derivative interactions and carries more information about the electromagnetic field . 
 the study of such kind of generalized einstein - maxwell theories could help us to explore the full properties and effects of the electromagnetic fields . 
 in general , the generalized einstein - maxwell theories can be classified into two classes . the first class is minimally coupled gravitational - electromagnetism in which there is no coupling in the lagrangian between the maxwell part and the curvature part . 
 one of the interesting generalized einstein - maxwell theory belong to this class is born - infeld theory @xcite which removes the divergence of the electron s self - energy in the classical electrodynamics and possesses good physical properties including the absence of shock waves and birefringence phenomena @xcite . 
 moreover , it is found that born - infeld theory enjoys an electric - magnetic duality @xcite and can describe gauge fields on a d - brane which arises from attached open strings @xcite . 
 the second class includes the nonminimal coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the lagrangian @xcite . 
 this class is of great interest because the appearance of the nonminimal couplings in the lagrangian modifies the coefficients of the second - order derivatives both in the maxwell and einstein equations , which could affect the propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in the spacetime and may yield time delays in the arrival of those waves @xcite . in the evolution of the early universe , such a kind of coupled terms may result in electromagnetic quantum fluctuations and lead to the inflation @xcite . 
 recent investigations also show that these cross - terms have been used as attempts to explain the large scale magnetic fields observed in clusters of galaxies @xcite . 
 it is of interest to search the solutions of black holes in the generalized einstein - maxwell theories and to probe how the generalized electrodynamics modify the properties of the black hole . in the frame of the born - infeld theory , 
 the electrically charged black hole solutions were obtained in @xcite , which displays that the black hole singularity in this theory is weaked from that of usual reissner - nordstr m black hole . in order to avoid the black hole singularity problem , 
 some regular models of black holes have been proposed in @xcite , which are called as bardeen black holes . 
 the bardeen black holes can be interpreted as the solution to a nonlinear magnetic monopole with a mass @xmath3 and a charge @xmath4 @xcite . 
 the bardeen black holes are also generalized to the model with four specific parameters @xcite . 
 recently , a large class of black hole solutions have been constructed in the power maxwell theory @xcite in which the maxwell action takes as power - law function of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a coupling constant and @xmath7 is a power parameter . 
 it is found that the asymptotic behavior of the solution depends heavily on the value of the power parameter @xmath7 . 
 moreover , the black hole solution have been considered in the modified maxwell field including the nonminimal coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xcite . 
 it is shown that these coupled terms modify the electromagnetic and gravitational structure of a charged black hole . 
 one of simple generalized electromagnetic theories is the electrodynamics with weyl corrections which involves a coupling between the maxwell field and the weyl tensor @xcite . in this theory 
 , the lagrangian density of the electromagnetic field is modified as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual electromagnetic tensor , which is related to the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath10 by @xmath11 . 
 the coefficient @xmath0 is a coupling constant with dimensions of length squared and the tensor @xmath12 is so - called weyl tensor , which is related to the riemann tensor @xmath13 , the ricci tensor @xmath14 and the ricci scalar @xmath15 by @xmath16\nu}-g_{\nu[\rho}r_{\sigma]\mu})+\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)}r g_{\mu[\rho}g_{\sigma]\nu},\label{wten}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the dimension and metric of the spacetime , and brackets around indices refers to the antisymmetric part . 
 therefore , the electrodynamics with weyl corrections ( [ lem ] ) is a special kind of electromagnetic theory which contains a coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields . 
 it was found that the such kind of couplings between curvature tensor and maxwell tensor could be obtained from a calculation in qed of the photon effective action from one - loop vacuum polarization on a curved background @xcite . 
 moreover , the investigations also show that these couplings could exist near classical compact astrophysical objects with high mass density and strong gravitational field such as the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite . 
 recently , many efforts have been focus on studying the effects of weyl correction on black hole physics . in ref.@xcite 
 , the authors studied the holographic conductivity and charge diffusion with weyl correction in the anti - de sitter spacetime and found that the correction breaks the universal relation with the @xmath19 central charge observed at leading order . 
 moreover , the holographic superconductors with weyl corrections are also studied in @xcite . 
 it is found that weyl corrections modify the critical temperature at which holographic superconductors occur @xcite and changes the order of the phase transition of the holographic superconductor @xcite . 
 the effects of weyl corrections on the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor has been also investigated in @xcite . 
 recently , we @xcite studied the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic perturbation coupling to the weyl tensor in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime and analyze the effect of the weyl corrections on the stability of the black hole . 
 it is well known that the properties and structure of a charged black hole depend heavily on the electrodynamics of maxwell field in the spacetime , which means that the corrections to the standard einstein - maxwell theory must bring some new features for the charged black hole . 
 the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the charged black hole in the electromagnetic theory with weyl corrections , and to probe how the weyl corrections modify its properties and structure . 
 the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will construct a static and spherically symmetric solution of a black hole with small weyl corrections , and then study the effect of the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 on the black hole . in sec.iii , we obtain a rotating charged black hole with small weyl corrections by the method of complex coordinate transformation @xcite and study the change of the spatial topology of the event horizons and the infinite redshift surface originating from the weyl corrections . 
 we end the paper with a summary . 
 let us now first study a static and spherically symmetric charged black hole with weyl correction . 
 the action for the gravity system with the coupling between electromagnetic field and weyl tensor has a form @xmath20.\label{acts}\end{aligned}\ ] ] adopting to schwarzshild coordinates , the line element for a static spherically symmetric spacetime can be put in the form @xmath21 where the metric coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions of polar coordinate @xmath24 . moreover 
 , we assume that the electromagnetic field inherits the static spherically symmetries , which means that the potential four - vetor of the electric field has the form @xmath25 
 inserting eqs.([wten ] ) , ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ au ] ) into the action ( [ acts ] ) and varying the action with respect to @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath10 , one can three coupled equations of motion @xmath26 = 0,\label{em1 } \\ & & 3\bigg[\phi'(r)^2r(r)^2+f(r)\bigg(r'(r)^2 - 2r(r)r''(r)\bigg)-2r(r)\bigg(r(r)f''(r)+r'(r)f'(r ) \bigg)\bigg]\nonumber\\ & & -4\alpha\bigg[2r(r)\phi''(r)^2\bigg(\phi'(r)f(r)\bigg)'+2r(r)r'(r ) \bigg(f(r)\phi'(r)^2\bigg)'-\phi'(r)^2\bigg(r'(r)^2f(r ) + 2f''(r)r(r)^2\bigg)\nonumber\\&&+2f(r)r(r)\phi'(r)\bigg(r(r)\phi'''(r ) + r''(r)\phi'(r)\bigg)\bigg]=0,\label{em2 } \\&&\frac{d}{dr}\bigg\{\phi'(r)r(r)+\frac{4\phi'(r)\alpha}{3r(r ) } \bigg[f(r)\bigg(r'(r)^2-r(r)r''(r)\bigg)+r(r)\bigg(r'(r)f''(r)-f'(r)r'(r)\bigg ) -2r(r)\bigg]\bigg\}=0.\nonumber\\&&\label{em3}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in order to obtain a solution of a black hole with weyl correction , we must solve these three coupling equations . as @xmath27 
 , one can find that equation ( [ em1 ] ) is decoupled naturally and then the solution of reissner - nordstr m black hole can be obtained . however , for the case with non - zero weyl coupling constant @xmath0 , we find that the modified equations of motion ( [ em1])-([em3 ] ) are so complicated that it is difficult for us to obtain an analytical solution of black hole . here , we limit ourselves to the case where the deviation of the coupling parameter @xmath0 from zero is very small which is physically justified for the weak weyl correction . 
 then the terms containing the parameter @xmath0 on the left - hand - side of the three equations above can be regarded as perturbation . using the perturbation theory , 
 we have @xmath28 substituting the variables ( [ wer ] ) into the equations of motion ( [ em1])-([em3 ] ) , we can obtain a series of perturbational equations . obviously , the usual reissner - nordstr m black hole is a solution of the zeroth order equations , which means that @xmath29    -@xmath4 plane , the event horizon is existed only the region @xmath30 for the charged black hole with weyl corrections ( [ metr1 ] ) . in the region 
 @xmath31 , there does not exist any horizon and the central object is a naked singularity . 
 the solid line marks the upper limit on the charge @xmath4 as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath0 . 
 the dashed line corresponds to the upper limit on the charge @xmath4 in the reissner - nordstr m black hole . here 
 , we set @xmath32.,width=264 ]    solving the first order equation , we obtain @xmath33 obviously , the metric coefficients and the static electric potential depend on the coupling parameter @xmath0 , which means that weyl corrections affect the behavior of the electric field and the properties of the charged black hole in this case . especially , we find that the static electric potential @xmath34 depends also on the black hole parameter @xmath3 , which is different from that in the usual reissner - nordstr m black hole in which the static electric potential @xmath34 depends only on the charge @xmath4 . 
 it is understandable because the weyl coupling in here is a kind of coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields . 
 the radius of black hole horizon is located at where @xmath35 for the charged black hole with weyl correction ( [ metr1 ] ) . however , the equation @xmath35 in this case could have more than two real roots . 
 considered that we here focus only on the weak weyl correction , it is reasonable to regard the roots near those in the case of reissner - nordstr m black hole as the radius of black hole horizon and to abandon other one as the extraneous roots of the equation . in this way , we can single out the roots corresponding to the radius of black hole horizons and probe the effects of weyl corrections on the horizons . in figure ( 1 ) , we delineate the region @xmath30 in the parameter space @xmath36 , within which the event horizon is existed for the spacetime ( [ metr1 ] ) . 
 the solid line marks the upper limit on the charge @xmath4 as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath0 , for which the event horizon is still existed . 
 the region @xmath31 corresponds to the part of the parameter space , where there does not exist any horizon and the central object is a naked singularity . from figure 
 ( 1 ) , we find that with weyl corrections the allowed range of @xmath4 increases for the negative @xmath0 and decreases for the positive @xmath0 . in figure 
 ( 2 ) , we plot the effects of weyl corrections on the inner and outer horizons of the black hole as the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 lie in the region @xmath30 . it is shown that with the increase of the weyl corrections , the radius of outer horizon @xmath37 decreases , but the radius of inner horizon @xmath38 increases for @xmath1 , but the situation is just the opposite for @xmath2 . 
 the change of hawking temperature @xmath39 of black hole with @xmath0 is plotted in figure ( 3 ) , which tells us that hawking temperature decreases with @xmath0 . in the low energy limit , the luminosity of hawking radiation of a spherically symmetric black hole ( [ metr1 ] ) 
 can be approximated as @xmath40 . from figure 
 ( 4 ) , one can find that the luminosity of hawking radiation also decreases with the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 .     as the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 lie in the region @xmath30 . 
 the left is for the outer horizon and the right is for the inner horizon . here 
 we set @xmath32 . 
 , title=""fig:"",width=264 ] as the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 lie in the region @xmath30 . 
 the left is for the outer horizon and the right is for the inner horizon . 
 here we set @xmath32 . 
 , title=""fig:"",width=264 ]     of black hole with weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 . here 
 we set @xmath32 . 
 , width=264 ]    . here 
 we set @xmath32.,width=264 ]    in a word , with the increase of the deviation from the reissner - nordstr m metric , the effects of wely corrections on the properties of the black hole in the case @xmath1 is different from that in the case @xmath2 . 
 in this section , we will study a rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections . in the presence of the coupling between the maxwell field and the weyl tensor , 
 the field equations of gravity for a rotating black hole are complicated . even if in the case with small weyl corrections , we find it is still very difficult to find exact analytical solution of a rotating black hole by usual perturbational method with some calculation softwares including maple and mathematica . considering that the spacetime described by the action ( [ acts ] ) is an electrovacuum solution 
 , we can apply the method of complex coordinate transformation discovered by newman and janis @xcite to construct a rotating black hole with the previous static black hole solution with small weyl corrections ( [ metr1 ] ) and then study the properties of the black hole spacetime . 
 although our method in this section is different from the perturbational method used in the previous section , the solution is true because in the action ( 3 ) the only non - gravitational mass - energy present is the field energy of an electromagnetic field and the spacetime described by the action ( 3 ) is electro - vacuum and the approach of newman and janis is substantiated for vacuum or electr - ovacuum @xcite . 
 moreover , in the following calculation , we neglect the terms of the order @xmath41 and the higher - order terms to keep the consistency with the small wey corrections just considered in the section ii .    introducing the new variable @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 one can rewrite the metric ( [ metr1 ] ) as @xmath44 
 the inverse of the above metric can be expressed as @xmath45 with the null tetrad vectors @xmath46\delta^{\mu}_1,\\ m^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r)}}\bigg(\delta^{\mu}_{2 } + \frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg),\\ \bar{m}^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r)}}\bigg(\delta^{\mu}_{2 } -\frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg).\end{aligned}\ ] ] now we regard the radius @xmath24 as a complex variable and then rewrite the null tetrad in the form @xmath47\bigg\ } \delta^{\mu}_1,\\ m^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r\bar{r})}}\bigg(\delta^{\mu}_{2 } + \frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg),\\ \bar{m}^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r\bar{r})}}\bigg(\delta^{\mu}_{2 } -\frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the complex conjugate of @xmath24 . as in ref.@xcite 
 , we can perform a complex coordinate transformation @xmath49 and find that the tetrad is transformed as @xmath50\delta^{\mu}_1,\\ m'^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r')}}\bigg[ia\sin\theta(\delta^{\mu}_0- \delta^{\mu}_1)+\delta^{\mu}_{2}+\frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg],\\ \bar{m}'^{\mu}&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2r(r')}}\bigg[-ia\sin\theta(\delta^{\mu}_0- \delta^{\mu}_1)+\delta^{\mu}_{2}-\frac{i}{\sin{\theta}}\delta^{\mu}_{3}\bigg].\end{aligned}\ ] ] with help of this new tetrad , the metric of a rotating charge black hole with weyl corrections can be described by @xmath51 in the coordinates ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , the covariant components of the metric ( [ metric4 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath56a\sin^2\theta',\\ g'_{33}&=&-\frac{\sin^2\theta'}{\sigma(r',\theta')}\bigg[\sigma(r',\theta')\sigma_1(r',\theta ' ) + a^2\sin^2\theta'\bigg(2\sigma(r',\theta')-f(r',\theta')\bigg)\bigg],\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath57 in order to eliminate the elements @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we must use a transformation @xcite to the coordinates ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) which is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 } { f(r',\theta')\sigma_1(r',\theta')+\sigma(r',\theta')a^2\sin^2\theta'},\\ g(r',\theta')&=&\frac{g'_{00}g'_{13}-g'_{01}g'_{03}}{g'_{00}g'_{33}-g'^2_{03 } } = \frac{a\sigma(r',\theta')}{f(r',\theta')\sigma_1(r',\theta')+\sigma(r',\theta')a^2\sin^2\theta'}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] and 
 then the metric for a rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections reads @xmath62a\sin^2\theta dtd\phi -\frac{\sigma(r,\theta)\sigma_1(r,\theta)dr^2}{f(r,\theta)\sigma_1(r,\theta ) + a^2\sin^2\theta\sigma(r,\theta ) } -\sigma_1(r,\theta)d\theta^2\nonumber\\&-&\frac{\sin^2\theta}{\sigma(r,\theta ) } \bigg[\sigma(r,\theta)\sigma_1(r,\theta ) + a^2\sin^2\theta\bigg(2\sigma(r,\theta)-f(r,\theta)\bigg)\bigg]d\phi^2 , \label{metric5}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath63 obviously , the above metric can be reduced to the kerr - newman metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates as @xmath64 . 
 when the rotation parameter @xmath65 vanishes , one can get the previous solution of a static and spherically symmetric black hole with weyl correction ( [ metr1 ] ) .    the mass and angular momentum of the rotating black hole with weyl corrections ( [ metric5 ] ) can be calculated by the quasi - local formalism of the brown and york @xcite , which is extensively applied to various rotating black holes @xcite . from the quasi - local formalism 
 , one can find that the finite stress - energy tensor is defined as @xmath66,\label{t50}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath68 of the boundary @xmath69 of the manifold @xmath70 , with the induced metric @xmath71 . in order to compute the angular momentum of the spacetime 
 , one can choose a spacelike surface @xmath72 in @xmath69 with the metric @xmath73 and decompose the boundary metric into the adm form @xmath74 where the coordinates @xmath75 are the angular variables parameterizing the hypersurface of constant @xmath24 . 
 the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the lapse and shift functions respectively . if there is a killing vector field @xmath78 on the boundary , one can find that the quasi - local conserved charge associated with the stress tensors can be defined by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the determinant of the metric @xmath73 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the killing vector field and the unit normal vector on the boundary @xmath83 , respectively . 
 for the boundary with timelike ( @xmath84 ) and rotational ( @xmath85 ) killing vector fields , one can write the quasi - local mass and angular momentum as in the forms @xmath86 combining the metric ( [ metric5 ] ) with eqs.([t50])-([t53 ] ) , we obtain the quasi - local mass and angular momentum @xmath87=m,\\ j&=&\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty}\bigg[ma-\frac{2aq^2}{3r } -\frac{2aq^2(a^2 - 10\alpha ) } { 15r^3}+\mathcal{o}\bigg(\frac{1}{r^4}\bigg)\bigg]=ma.\end{aligned}\ ] ] obviously , the quasi - local mass and angular momentum of the rotating black hole with weyl corrections ( [ metric5 ] ) coincide with those in the usual kerr - newman black hole spacetime . 
 the main reason is that these quasi - local mass and angular momentum are decided by the properties of the surface @xmath83 at spatial infinity at where the effects of weyl corrections are vanished in the dominant terms . 
 this means that the wely corrections in the lagrangian density ( [ lem ] ) do not change the quasi - local mass and angular momentum of the black hole ( [ metric5 ] ) . 
 the electric charge of the black hole with weyl correction ( [ metric5 ] ) can be obtained by calculating the flux of the electric field at infinity @xmath88 here @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the area element of a two - dimensional closed space - like surface at the spatial infinity @xmath91 , which has a form @xmath92 at spatial infinity @xmath93 , the potential four - vetor of the electric field of the black hole ( [ metric5 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath94 substituting it into the integral ( [ mq0 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath95=q.\end{aligned}\ ] ] it indicates that the electric charge of the rotating black hole with weyl corrections is still @xmath96 and the presence of weyl corrections also does not affect the electric charge of the black hole . 
 -@xmath4 plane , the inner and outer horizons are topologically spherical surfaces without intersection in the region i. as the parameters lie in the region ii , there does not exist any horizon for black hole with weyl corrections .

 the right panel is for the black hole with the fixed parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . 
 here we set @xmath32.,title=""fig:"",width=264 ]    let us now study the properties of such a rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections ( [ metric5 ] ) . 
 the position of the black hole horizon is defined by equation @xmath104 i.e. , @xmath105 it indicates that for @xmath106 the radius @xmath107 depends on the polar angle coordinate @xmath108 , which is similar to those in the modified kerr metrics by the deformation parameter @xmath109 @xcite or the polymeric function @xmath110 in loop quantum gravity @xcite . 
 furthermore , the position and the shape of horizons are defined by the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath65 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 . for a rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections , we find that the whole parameter space ( @xmath0-@xmath4 ) can be divided into four regions for fixed @xmath65 as shown in figure ( 5 ) . in the region 
 i , we find that both of the inner and outer horizons are topologically spherical surfaces and these two surfaces never cross each other . in the region 
 ii , there exist no horizons and the singularity is naked entirely . these properties of black hole are similar to those in the non - rotating black hole with weyl corrections . 
 however , we also find that when the parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) lie in the region iii , the outer horizon coincides the inner horizon near the north and south poles and the horizons merge into a closed toroidal surface ( see in the left panel of figure(6 ) ) . 
 when the parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) lie in the region iv , the parts of the outer and inner horizons in the northern hemisphere join together to form a new closed surface with spherical topology . 
 the similar case also occurs in the southern hemisphere , and then two new and disconnected horizons are formed , which is shown in the right panel in fig . 
 these properties of black holes are not observed in the non - rotating black hole with weyl corrections . 
 moreover , we also note that the value of the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 is negative in the region iii and is positive in the region iv , which means that the effects of the weyl corrections with positive @xmath0 on the black hole are quite different from those in the case with negative @xmath0 . 
 it is easy for us to find that properties of the rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections ( [ metr1 ] ) are similar to the properties of the rotating non - kerr black hole @xcite . 
 the unique difference is that when the outer and inner horizons merge into a closed toroidal surface the singularity is naked in the rotating charged black hole with weyl corrections , but it is enveloped by the toroidal surface in the rotating non - kerr black hole . with the increasing weyl corrections , the value of the upper limit of @xmath4 in the regions i and iii is increasing for @xmath2 , but the value of the upper limit of @xmath4 in the regions i and iv is decreasing for @xmath1 . 
 moreover , with the increase of the rotation parameter @xmath65 , the range of the regions iii and iv increases . 
 furthermore , we find that as the parameters lie in the region i ( see fig.(5 ) ) the radius of the outer horizon for a black hole with @xmath1 is smaller than that in the case with @xmath2 , which is consistent with those in a static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetime with weyl corrections ( [ metr1 ] ) . 
 the ergosphere is an important zone around a rotating black hole , which is bounded by the event horizon @xmath37 and the outer infinite redshift surface @xmath111 . 
 the infinite redshift surface is determined by @xmath112 , i.e. , @xmath113 similarly , the whole parameter space ( @xmath0-@xmath4 ) can be divided into three regions to study the properties of the infinite redshift surface for fixed @xmath65 , which is shown in figure ( 7 ) . 
 we can find that the inner and outer infinite redshift surfaces are topologically spherical surfaces without intersection as the parameters @xmath36 lie in the region i and there is no any infinite redshift surface as the parameters @xmath36 lie in the region ii . in the region iii , the inner and outer infinite redshift surfaces merge into a new infinite redshift surface with toroidal topology around the original point , which is shown in figure ( 8) . 
 the new infinite redshift surface becomes more and more thin and looks like a disk as the rotation parameter @xmath65 increases . 
 -@xmath4 plane , the inner and outer infinite redshift surfaces are topologically spherical surfaces without intersection in the region i. as the parameters lie in the region ii , there does not exist any infinite redshift surface for black hole with weyl corrections .

 it means that with the increase of the weyl corrections the energy extraction become easier in the background of a black hole with @xmath1 , but more difficult in the background of a black hole with @xmath2 . 
 in this paper we present firstly a four - dimensional spherical symmetric black hole with small weyl corrections and find that the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 affects the radius of the event horizon , hawking temperature and hawking radiation of the black hole . 
 moreover , we find that with the increasing weyl corrections the region of the event horizon existence for the black hole increases for the negative @xmath0 and decreases for the positive @xmath0 . 
 moreover , we obtain also a rotating charged black hole with weak weyl corrections by the method of complex coordinate transformation . 
 we find that presence of weyl corrections makes the black hole horizon as a function of the polar angle coordinate @xmath108 , which brings some special properties of the black hole horizon . 
 in particular , the rotating black hole with @xmath2 develops two disconnected topologically spherical horizons above some critical spin and charge parameters . in the case with @xmath1 , the horizon looks more like a toroidal surface above some critical @xmath65 and @xmath4 . comparing with the spacetime with @xmath2 , the change of the topological properties of the horizons become easier in the spacetime with @xmath1 . 
 we also analyze the dependence of the ergosphere on the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 and find that the ergosphere in the equatorial plane becomes thick for a black hole with @xmath1 , but becomes thin in the case with @xmath2 . 
 it means that with the increase of the weyl corrections the energy extraction become easier in the background of a black hole with @xmath1 , but more difficult in the background of a black hole with @xmath2 . 
 finally , we must point out that we here have not discussed the thermodynamic properties of the rotating charged black hole with the weyl corrections . 
 the main reason is that the radius of black hole horizon is a function of the polar angle coordinate @xmath108 , which leads to that the surface gravity @xmath116 is not a well - defined quantity at the killing horizon .

10,"the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) will presumably be revealed in the coming years through a combination of lhc and ilc data . 
 it is expected that embedded in the newly discovered physics will be an explanation of how this mechanism remains stable under quantum corrections . until this time , it is vital that we study the different known field theoretical mechanisms of ewsb that stabilize the higgs potential . 
 the little higgs mechanism  @xcite is a revival of composite higgs models  @xcite that attempted to solve these issues . in these models , 
 the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson of approximate global symmetries that are added on to the standard model ( sm ) . in the little higgs mechanism , 
 the electroweak scale is stabilized against quadratically divergent corrections by the manner in which perturbative couplings break the global symmetries . in the simplest models , the higgs mass receives no quadratically divergent quantum corrections until two loop order , although models with a larger symmetry structure can postpone these corrections to higher loop order  @xcite . 
 the most compact implementation of the little higgs mechanism is known as the littlest higgs model  @xcite . in this model , the sm 
 is enlarged to incorporate an approximate @xmath10 global symmetry . 
 this symmetry is broken down to @xmath11 spontaneously , though the mechanism of this breaking is left unspecified . 
 the higgs is an approximate goldstone boson of this breaking . 
 while the earliest littlest higgs models have issues with low energy constraints  @xcite , recent studies have shown that this structure is still possible if one adds a discrete @xmath12 symmetry to the model  @xcite . 
 known as t - parity , this symmetry forbids the couplings which led to stringent electroweak precision and compositeness bounds in the original littlest higgs model . 
 a consistent and phenomenologically viable littlest higgs model with t - parity requires the introduction of `` mirror fermions ''  @xcite . for each new sm doublet 
 , there must be another doublet which has the opposite t - parity eigenvalue . 
 these mirror fermions are required to cut off otherwise large four - fermion operators constrained primarily by lep , and drell - yan processes  @xcite , but they also open up a new flavor structure in the model . from studies of supersymmetry and other models of new physics , it is known that new flavor structure at the tev scale is quite stringently constrained  @xcite . 
 this is primarily due to the presence , in the sm , of a gim mechanism  @xcite . 
 the lightness of the sm fermions , coupled with the near diagonal texture of the ckm matrix , strongly suppress flavor and cp violating amplitudes , pushing them well below their naive dimension analysis ( nda ) estimated values . in the absence of a tev scale gim mechanism , new contributions to neutral meson mixing and rare decays are often many orders of magnitude larger than the sm contributions  @xcite . 
 neutral meson mixing , cp violation , and rare decays have been tested experimentally through a variety of different observables , and are not substantially different than expectations derived from sm calculations . 
 therefore we expect there to be very little freedom in the new flavor sector . in this paper , we study the flavor constraints on the extended t - odd fermion sector of the littlest higgs model with t - parity . specifically , we consider constraints from neutral meson particle anti - particle mixing , leaving rare decays for future study .    in section  [ model ] 
 , we outline the conventions used to derive the feynman rules relevant to flavor physics . in section  [ flavorsec ] , 
 we discuss how we approach the process of diagonalizing the action to the mass eigenbasis , and identify the new parameters which describe the new sources of flavor mixing and cp violation . in section  [ smmix ] , we outline the calculations for neutral meson mixing in the sm . in section  [ calculation ] , the contributions to neutral meson mixing involving the t - odd fields is presented . 
 section  [ results ] contains a numerical analysis of the bounds on the parameters describing the t - odd fermion sector , and an analysis of @xmath5 mixing . 
 we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] . in the appendix 
 , we give the relevant feynman rules , as well as the formulas which arise from calculating the one loop contributions to flavor changing operators . 
 the littlest higgs model  @xcite is the most compact way of extending the sm to include a collective symmetry breaking structure that protects the higgs mass . in the littlest higgs model , 
 the theory is approximately invariant under @xmath10 global symmetry transformations . 
 a scalar vev of an @xmath10 symmetric tensor @xmath13 spontaneously breaks this @xmath10 down to @xmath11 at a scale @xmath14 . 
 this scale is presumed to be @xmath15 . 
 the higgs boson is one of the goldstone bosons associated with this breaking . 
 an @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] subgroup embedded in the global @xmath10 is gauged , and after @xmath13 gets a vev , this gauge symmetry is reduced to the sm @xmath17 . 
 perturbative couplings in the model break the @xmath10 global symmetry explicitly , and quantum corrections involving these interactions generate masses and non - derivative couplings for the goldstone fluctuations , rendering them pseudo - goldstone bosons . 
 the higgs mass is protected from quadratic divergences at the one - loop level due to the way in which perturbative couplings are introduced . 
 any single coupling preserves at least one of two overlapping @xmath18 subgroups of the full @xmath10 global symmetry . under these @xmath18 subgroups , 
 the higgs is still an exact goldstone boson . 
 the vev which breaks the @xmath10 softly breaks these @xmath18 symmetries , and thus generates logarithmically divergent contributions to the higgs mass at one loop . 
 amplitudes involving perturbative couplings only generate a quadratically divergent contribution at two loop order . 
 the value for the higgs mass obtained by nda arguments is then suppressed relative to the breaking scale @xmath14 by a loop factor 
 .    the effective action is parametrized by a non - linear sigma model . only the goldstone bosons of the @xmath10 breaking 
 are included in the low energy effective theory , and the way in which the theory is linearized , or uv completed , is left ambiguous . in terms of these goldstone fields , 
 the symmetric tensor @xmath13 can be expressed as : @xmath19 the `` pion '' matrix @xmath20 contains the goldstone degrees of freedom , and @xmath21 is the vev of @xmath13 : @xmath22    to implement the collective symmetry breaking structure , the gauge generators are embedded in the @xmath10 global symmetry such that any given generator commutes with an @xmath18 subgroup of the @xmath10 global symmetry : @xmath23 the @xmath24 and @xmath25 generators commute with the @xmath26 subgroup of @xmath10 whose generators occupy the lower right hand corner . 
 the @xmath27 and @xmath28 generators similarly commute with the @xmath29 subgroup in the upper left . 
 the vev @xmath21 breaks the extended gauge group @xmath30 ^ 2 $ ] down to the sm electroweak @xmath31 , leading to the broken combinations acquiring masses given to lowest order in @xmath32 by @xmath33 the pseudo - goldstone bosons of the @xmath10 breaking then decompose into representations of the electroweak gauge group as follows : @xmath34 the @xmath35 and @xmath36 are eaten in the higgsing of the extended gauge sector down to the sm gauge group . 
 the pion matrix , with the higgs doublet and complex triplet @xmath37 identified along with the eaten goldstone bosons , is given by @xmath38    in the model we consider , a t - parity @xmath12 discrete symmetry is enforced to make the model consistent with electroweak precision tests . this @xmath12 is derived from an automorphism of the gauge groups which exchanges the @xmath39_1 $ ] gauge group with @xmath40_2 $ ] . 
 if the lagrangian is made invariant under such a transformation , tree level electroweak precision constraints are avoided  @xcite . 
 this can be achieved by setting couplings associated with the two gauge groups to be equal , and also imposing that the particle content of the model is symmetric under this transformation . if the symmetry is made exact , the lightest t - parity odd particle is stabilized , and is a dark matter candidate  @xcite . 
 the heavy gauge bosons are odd under t - parity , and so tree level four - fermion operators involving sm fermions are also forbidden .    under t - parity , 
 the goldstone boson matrix transforms as @xmath41 where @xmath42 . 
 this transformation law can be derived from the requirement that the kinetic term for @xmath13 be invariant under exchange of the two sets of gauge bosons . 
 this transformation law for the goldstone bosons ensures that the @xmath43 triplet is odd under t - parity , and that there is thus no trilinear coupling of the triplet to the sm higgs doublet . 
 this forbids a small vev being generated for the triplet which would otherwise cause phenomenologically constrained violations of the custodial @xmath44 symmetry of the sm higgs potential  @xcite . 
 we will give now in detail the structure of the fermion sector of the model . 
 to avoid compositeness constraints and simultaneously implement t - parity , it is necessary to double the sm fermion doublet spectrum  @xcite . for each sm 
 @xmath43 doublet , a doublet under @xmath45 and one under @xmath46 are introduced . 
 the t - parity even combination is associated with the sm @xmath43 doublet while the t - odd combination is given a mass of order the breaking scale , @xmath14 . 
 the fermion doublets @xmath47 can be embedded into incomplete representations @xmath48 of @xmath10 , and the field content can be expressed as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a t - odd @xmath11 multiplet which transforms non - linearly under the global @xmath10 . 
 the transformation laws for @xmath51 and @xmath52 under @xmath10 are as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an @xmath10 transformation . 
 the action of t - parity on the multiplets takes @xmath55 and @xmath56 . 
 it is possible to extend the gauge and global symmetry structure of the model to include new t - even gauge bosons and scalars , and in some of these extensions , all of the fermions that are introduced can be made to transform linearly  @xcite . 
 the flavor changing processes that we calculate are in fact present in all of these models . 
 we note however that in these extensions , there may be new flavor changing processes involving the extra t - even fields that give additional contributions . we choose to work with the model that has the simplest gauge and global symmetry structure , and which is likely the least constrained . 
 the t - parity even combination of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the sm electroweak quark and lepton doublets , while the t - odd combination is given a dirac mass with the @xmath59 of the @xmath50 @xmath11 representations through the following yukawa interaction : @xmath60 the insertion of @xmath61 is necessary to make these terms invariant under @xmath10 rotations  @xcite . 
 the t - odd combination of left - handed doublets gains a mass ( before ewsb ) equal to @xmath62 . 
 after ewsb , a small mass splitting between the t - odd up and down - type quarks is induced , and the masses are given by @xmath63    the remaining degrees of freedom in @xmath50 are given masses with another non - linearly transforming multiplet . 
 a spinor multiplet of @xmath11 could be introduced . 
 this multiplet includes two @xmath43 singlets , and one doublet . 
 these could marry with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and then one more singlet would be necessary to lift the entire spectrum . 
 we note that the @xmath50 fields do not have any gauge interactions with sm fermions , due to the fact that they are odd t - parity eigenstates . 
 they can thus only have gauge interactions with the t - even sm gauge bosons . similarly , the interactions with t - odd goldstone bosons coming from eq . 
 ( [ yukdiag ] ) can only involve the left - handed sm fermions .    in our analysis 
 , we assume that the mass of the doublets @xmath65 are much larger than the breaking scale @xmath14 , and the additional singlets @xmath64 have masses of @xmath66 . 
 they are necessary to cancel two loop quartic divergences to the higgs mass , but are otherwise allowed to be decoupled from the spectrum  @xcite . at @xmath67 , 
 the mass is large enough to have only negligible effects on low energy phenomenology , but low enough to keep the higgs mass small . 
 the @xmath65 doublet is necessary only to cancel a divergence proportional to @xmath68 , which is relatively small , so it is fine for its mass to be rather large ( perhaps @xmath69  tev ) . 
 increasing its mass also decouples its effects on flavor physics , as the masses are not due to the yukawa coupling @xmath70 , and are simple dirac masses . 
 the flavor changing couplings of the @xmath64 singlets arise only at order @xmath32 , and thus the effects are suppressed relative to those we calculate . in summary , including these fermions in the flavor analysis is a higher order effect . 
 we note that if the @xmath65 doublet is taken to be light , then its flavor effects arise through box diagrams where components of the complex triplet @xmath37 run in the loop .    in order to prevent against large contributions to the higgs mass from one loop quadratic divergences , 
 the third generation light yukawa interaction must be modified so that it incorporates the collective symmetry breaking structure . 
 in order to do this , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 multiplets for the third generation must be completed to representations of the @xmath29 and @xmath26 subgroups of @xmath10 . 
 these multiplets are @xmath71 where @xmath24 and @xmath27 obey the same transformation laws under t - parity and the @xmath10 symmetry as do @xmath51 and @xmath52 . 
 it should be noted that the quark doublets are embedded such that @xmath72 one must also introduce additional singlets @xmath73 and @xmath74 which transform under t - parity as @xmath75 so the top sector can be implemented in the following t - parity invariant way  @xcite @xmath76 u_{3r } { \nonumber \\ } & & \hspace{1 in } + \lambda_2 f ( \bar{t}'_1 t'_{1r } + \bar{t}'_2 t'_{2r})+ h.c.\end{aligned}\ ] ] this yukawa interaction generates a mass for the top quark given by @xmath77 while the orthogonal t - even combination ( @xmath78 ) , and the t - odd combination of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , ( @xmath81 ) acquire masses given by @xmath82 the t - odd combination of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 doublets get their mass from the same yukawa coupling as the other t - odd doublets discussed earlier . 
 the other two generations of sm up - type quarks acquire their mass through similar terms , though with the @xmath85 quarks missing from the @xmath24 and @xmath27 multiplets since the yukawa couplings are small and these quadratic divergences are suppressed . 
 the @xmath81 quark only has sizeable `` flavor changing '' interactions with the sm top quark mass eigenstate and the @xmath86  @xcite , and so it does not contribute to any of the processes we study . 
 before beginning a discussion of the t - odd fermion mass sector , we briefly review the process as it works in the sm  @xcite . 
 the yukawa sector generates mass matrices for the three up - type quarks given by @xmath87 after ewsb which is diagonalized by two unitary matrices , @xmath88 and @xmath54 : @xmath89 the gauge eigenstates are then expressed in terms of ( the primed ) mass eigenstates by @xmath90 a similar procedure applies to the down - type quark mass matrix . 
 much of the information contained in the diagonalization of the mass matrices is redundant when one looks at sm amplitudes for cross sections . 
 the cross - over to the mass eigenbasis leaves most of the gauge interaction portion of the lagrangian invariant . 
 it is only the weak interactions which couple the @xmath91 and @xmath92 sectors that are affected : @xmath93 = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2 } } \left [ \bar{u'}_i    ( v_u^{\dagger})^i_j { \displaystyle{\not } w}^+ p_l ( v_d)^j_k d'^k + \bar{d}_i    ( v_d^\dagger)^i_j     { \displaystyle{\not } w}^- p_l ( v_u)^j_k u'^k \right]\ ] ] in the sm , the only observable rotation is the combination @xmath94 this is no longer necessarily the case when one introduces additional fermions which couple to the sm .    the mass eigenbasis in the t - odd fermion sector is not necessarily aligned with the sm fermion sector . 
 these additional mixings are a source of flavor changing processes that are the focus of this paper . 
 the interaction that gives the t - odd doublets their mass , eq .  ( 
 [ yukdiag ] ) , can be extended to include generational mixing : @xmath95 in analogy with the ckm transformations , the resulting mass matrix @xmath96 is diagonalized by two @xmath97 matrices : @xmath98 @xmath99 acts on the left handed fields while @xmath100 acts on the right handed @xmath50 fields . 
 we note that these matrices are identical for the up and down - type t - odd fermions , since the resulting dirac mass terms are @xmath43 symmetric . 
 the gauge interaction portion of the kinetic terms in the t - parity eigenbasis are given qualitatively by @xmath101 where the @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the t - odd gauge bosons and fermions with mass @xmath104 . 
 the @xmath105 are the t - even eigenstates . 
 one can further rotate this t - parity eigenbasis into the mass eigenbasis , where flavor mixings in both the t - odd and t - even sectors are taken into account . identifying the mass eigenstates with a @xmath106 and @xmath107 index for heavy and light , respectively , these interactions can be re - expressed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 the rotation matrix @xmath99 is in @xmath97 , and operates on the flavor indices of the left handed t - odd fermions 
 . in analogy with the ckm matrix then , the rotations relevant to flavor physics are @xmath110 note that the two matrices are related through the sm ckm matrix : @xmath111 this is an important result , as it implies that one can not completely turn off the new mixing effects except with a universally degenerate mass spectrum for the t - odd doublets . 
 for example , if @xmath112 is set to be the identity , then @xmath113 . 
 there is a subtlety here involving the t - even partner of the top quark which is responsible for canceling the top quark s quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs mass . 
 as it is only inserted in the top quark sector , it explicitly breaks flavor symmetries in a way such that the symmetry can not be restored through a spurion analysis . if we were to assume that the up - type yukawa couplings are flavor diagonal , then the top quark divergence is canceled as in the littlest higgs model . from this starting point , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , and @xmath117 . 
 because there is no symmetry in place which forbids such off - diagonal top - yukawa elements , this perhaps seems a bit unnatural . 
 we note that the flavor symmetry could easily be restored by completing all three generations of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 doublet quarks to be @xmath29 and @xmath26 triplets . 
 doing so leads to a somewhat more natural picture of how the top quark divergence is canceled , but at the expense of introducing @xmath118 additional particles ( a t - even and t - odd partner for each of the two remaining up - type quarks ) . 
 the effects of these new quarks on flavor physics and ewp would be vanishingly small , since , as found in  @xcite , these effects are approximately proportional to @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the mass of either the up or charm quark . 
 the new @xmath81 flavor contributions would scale in the same way . 
 since the masses for the first two generations are quite small , this effect is extremely suppressed . 
 depending on the mass of these new particles , however , the collider phenomenology  @xcite could be quite different . 
 for the remainder of this analysis , we assume that the flavor symmetry is only explicitly violated by mass terms , and that the fermions come in @xmath121 multiplets , and that therefore , @xmath122 is free to take on any value 
 . the earlier model can easily be obtained from this one by picking specific mass textures , and decoupling the partners of the lighter up - type quarks .    beyond the sm , there are three new rotation angles , and one new cp violating phase , as we explain here . 
 there are two unitary matrices which show up in observables , @xmath123 , and @xmath112 . 
 these have 3 rotations each , and 6 phases each . 
 there are 6 quark fields which transform under @xmath45 , and 6 under @xmath46 . 
 each set of 6 quark fields can absorb 5 phases ( an overall phase in each sector is unobservable ) . 
 what remains are 6 total rotations , and 2 cp violating phases . 
 one combination of @xmath123 and @xmath112 gives the sm ckm matrix , which has 3 rotations and 1 phase . 
 we then parametrize @xmath112 the same way as we do the ckm matrix , but with new angles @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and phase @xmath127 : @xmath128 the matrix @xmath123 can then be extracted from the relation @xmath129 . with this parametrization , we can analyze all of the physical degrees of freedom in the model . throughout our analysis 
 , we use for the sm ckm matrix the pdg best fit angles  @xcite @xmath130    there are also interaction terms containing a t - odd goldstone boson , a t - odd fermion , and a sm fermion . 
 these arise from expanding the t - odd yukawa interactions in eq . 
 ( [ toddyukmix ] ) in the mass eigenbasis . 
 similarly , these only involve the rotations @xmath123 and @xmath112 . in table  [ flavorrules ! ] , in the appendix , we give the feynman rules relevant to flavor physics . 
 the state of the art theory predictions for mixing in the @xmath0 and @xmath131 systems agree with experimental results up to theoretical errors in long distance effects and qcd corrections . in @xmath2 mixing , there is only an upper bound . in this section , 
 we give a very brief summary of the sm predictions for neutral meson mixing . for more detailed discussions 
 see  @xcite 
 . we also comment on the relevance of each system to our study of the littlest higgs model with t - parity .      the lowest order sm contribution to the effective hamiltonian that governs neutral @xmath0 meson mixing 
 is given by @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the masses of the quarks in the loop , and the @xmath136 are defined as functions of ckm matrix elements : @xmath137 . the function @xmath138 is given in the t hooft - feynman gauge in the appendix . 
 this function is finite in the t hooft - feynman gauge , but divergent in unitary gauge . when summing over the different flavors , the gauge dependence cancels after imposing unitarity of the ckm matrix through the relation @xmath139 . 
 the final form of the effective hamiltonian after this substitution is given by @xmath140 { \nonumber \\ } & & \hspace{3in}\times ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a ) } ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a ) } , \label{effhamsm}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath141 and the @xmath142 are qcd corrections . 
 we will see a similar structure for the contributions to the effective hamiltonian from the t - odd fermions . in practice , for the sm particles the masses of the lighter particles are taken to be zero in the formula above , leading to simplified expressions . 
 for example , in @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing , taking @xmath143 gives the standard functions : @xmath144    the effective hamiltonians for mixing in the other neutral meson systems can easily be obtained from eq . 
 ( [ effhamsm ] ) by altering the @xmath136 , the four - quark operator , and the @xmath142 . 
 for example , to get the result for @xmath131 mixing , each occurrence of @xmath145 should be replaced by @xmath146 , and the @xmath147 s that correspond to the @xmath1 system should be inserted . 
 we show here how to obtain the physical observables from the effective hamiltonians . 
 we restrict our analysis to neutral meson mass splittings and @xmath148 . 
 we comment on the relevance of these observables to our analysis of t - parity flavor physics .      we will use two observables from @xmath149 mixing : the mass difference @xmath150 , and the parameter @xmath148 , related to the real and the imaginary part of @xmath151 , respectively . 
 more specifically we have for @xmath150 : @xmath152 the sm prediction is @xmath153\right\},\ ] ] where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the @xmath0-meson decay constant and mass , respectively . 
 @xmath156 is an order one non - perturbative `` bag '' parameter . 
 the theoretical prediction for @xmath148 is given by @xmath157 and the sm prediction is then @xmath158 - \mathrm{re}\,\lambda_t \eta_2 s_0(x_t ) \right\ } \exp(i   \pi/4)\,.\ ] ]    @xmath0 mixing imposes some of the tightest bounds on the t - odd fermion spectrum . 
 bounds on the mass splitting of the neutral mass eigenstates ( or , equivalently , the mixing frequency of the cp eigenstates ) impose constraints on the first two generations of t - odd fermions , as we will show in section  [ results ] . 
 in addition , if there is a cp violating phase in @xmath112 , then there are new physics contributions to the @xmath148 observable , the measure of indirect cp violation in @xmath0 decays . as we show in section  [ results ] , this observable is often the most sensitive to little higgs physics . 
 this is in analogy with the `` @xmath148 problem '' in supersymmetry ( see for example  @xcite ) . 
 in addition , it would be interesting to study the @xmath159 observable , which is the measure of direct cp violation in @xmath0 decays . 
 we leave this for future work .      in our analysis we will also discuss the mass differences in the @xmath161 and @xmath162 systems . in terms of low energy matrix elements , 
 these mass splittings are given by @xmath163 for neutral b mesons the functional form is identical to the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 mixing , although with new @xmath136 , @xmath142 , and bag parameters . 
 the hierarchy of the ckm matrix elements , however , allows for simplification of the effective hamiltonian , so that to an excellent approximation , it depends only on @xmath164 . 
 the sm prediction is therefore @xmath165    neutral @xmath1 mixing is particularly interesting due to the large amount of progress currently being made both on experimentally constraining @xmath146-quark physics , and on pinning down the theoretical sm predictions for @xmath1 meson observables . 
 a particularly exciting system to study from the perspective of current developments is the @xmath5 system . 
 the mass splitting is so far undetermined by experiment .    in our analysis , the @xmath131 
 neutral meson mass splitting provides constraints that are complementary to those from the @xmath0 system . 
 because the @xmath131 system is more sensitive to physics in the third generation , it generally imposes stronger bounds on the third generation t - odd fermion doublet than the @xmath0 system alone .      for @xmath2 meson mixing no mass splitting 
 has yet been observed . the sm short distance contribution to the @xmath2 mixing effective hamiltonian 
 is extremely suppressed , due to gim and ckm factors . 
 there are potentially larger long distance contributions , but these are not well understood due to sensitivity to low energy strong dynamics . 
 the current experimental bound is given by  @xcite @xmath167 in our analysis , we assume that the new physics contribution dwarfs any sm contributions .    in our analysis , the @xmath2 system provides an important counterweight in constraining the extended fermion sector . unlike the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems , 
 the t - odd fermion contributions to mixing come from the up - type diagonalization matrix , @xmath123 . without the current experimental upper bound on the @xmath2 meson mass splitting 
 , the constraints on the t - odd fermion sector would be vanishing for @xmath168 . 
 however , the relation @xmath169 requires that if @xmath170 , then @xmath171 . if down - type mixing is suppressed by very small off - diagonal elements , then up - type mixing is unavoidable . 
 we now calculate the corrections to the relevant effective hamiltonians in the littlest higgs model with t - parity . 
 the dominant contributions arise from box diagrams which have t - odd fermions running within the loop , along with t - odd gauge bosons . 
 there are also sub - dominant effects coming from the extended top sector of the model , which we briefly discuss as well .      from the t - odd sector 
 we get several new contributions to neutral meson mixing . 
 these contributions come from box diagrams that contain heavy gauge bosons and t - odd fermions , and in general are suppressed by a factor of @xmath172 . 
 however , this suppression is vastly overcome in most regions of parameter space due to the absence of a tev scale gim mechanism . 
 the diagrams can be classified according to the gauge boson running in the loop : @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and `` mixed '' @xmath174 and @xmath175 . 
 these are shown in figure  [ fig : boxes ] . 
 we have calculated these diagrams both in the t  hooft - feynman and the unitary gauge , and we now review the results . 
 the diagrams with internal @xmath176 and charged goldstone bosons give a contribution to the effective hamiltonian which has the same functional form as the sm calculation , with some simple replacements . for the heavy neutral gauge bosons , @xmath177 and @xmath86 , we have apart from the @xmath178-like diagrams , also `` crossed '' diagrams where the gauge bosons attach to opposite vertices on one side of the box . after summing over the two types we find that each class of diagrams , namely the `` zz '' , `` aa '' , and `` za '' diagrams , are independently gauge invariant . 
 we carried out the full calculation in both t hooft - feynman gauge and unitary gauge , but gauge independence can be shown to hold in any @xmath179 gauge . 
 a similar phenomenon occurs in the sm for boxes that contain @xmath180 and @xmath181 @xcite ( these diagrams do not contribute to neutral meson mixing , of course ) . 
 furthermore , the contribution of the diagrams containing neutral scalars vanishes after summing over the regular and crossed diagrams . 
 this effect can be traced back to the fact that the coupling of the eaten t - odd goldstone bosons to the heavy and light fermions is purely left handed , and that the momentum assignment on one of the fermion lines is in the opposite direction of fermion number flow in the crossed diagrams .    the total contribution from the t - odd sector to neutral @xmath0 mixing ( neglecting qcd corrections ) 
 is given by @xmath182 ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a ) } ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a)}. { \nonumber \\}&&\ \label{effham}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the functions @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 correspond to the contributions of the `` ww '' , `` zz '' , `` aa '' , and `` za '' diagrams , respectively . 
 their explicit form in t  hooft - feynman gauge is given in the appendix . in the above formula @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which are identical at lowest order in @xmath32 . 
 ignoring the higher order effects of the @xmath189 mass splitting , we replace @xmath190 with @xmath191 in the rest of the text . @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the masses of the t - odd quarks in the loop , and the @xmath192 are functions of @xmath112 matrix elements : @xmath193 . 
 as in the sm calculation , we can present the result in a more compact way . imposing unitarity of @xmath112 
 , we can re - write the effective hamiltonian as : @xmath194 ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a ) } ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a)},\ ] ] where @xmath195{\nonumber \\ } & & r_3 ( z_i , z_j , z_k ) = \sum_{m \in \ { f , g , a_1,a_2 \ } }   \left[m      ( z_i , z_i ) - m(z_i , z_j ) - m(z_i , z_k)+ m(z_j , z_k)\right ] , { \nonumber \\}&&\   \label{toddcompact}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath147 parametrizes the effects of qcd corrections that will be discussed in more detail below .    the effective hamiltonians relevant to @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing can easily by obtained from eq . 
 ( [ toddcompact ] ) by simply interchanging indices in the mixing parameters , @xmath192 , and relabeling the quarks in the four - fermion operator . 
 interpreting these new contributions as shifts in physical observables is quite easy through application of the same techniques used in the sm calculations . 
 the only subtleties that arise are involved with the qcd corrections .    before moving on to examine the t - even contributions , 
 it is instructive to look at an approximate formula for the t - odd contributions to the effective hamiltonian . in particular , 
 if we go to the limit where the t - odd doublet spectrum is nearly degenerate , and assume that the t - odd fermion masses are significantly larger than the t - odd gauge bosons ( @xmath196 ) , we find that eq . 
 ( [ effham ] ) reduces to the following form : @xmath197 ^ 2 ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a ) } ( \bar{s } d)_{(v - a)},\ ] ] where @xmath198 , and @xmath199 . in this expression 
 , it is easy to see the gim mechanism at work . 
 the lowest order terms in the mass splitting expansion are at @xmath200 . 
 there are also contributions to flavor changing diagrams coming from diagrams which involve the t - even partner of the top quark , @xmath78 . 
 these have been calculated in  @xcite for the littlest higgs model without t - parity , and the results from these calculations are much the same as in the littlest higgs model with t - parity , although some of the diagrams in that model no longer exist due to certain couplings being forbidden by t - parity . 
 for example , in diagrams with t - even fermions running in the loop , there are no contributions which involve the heavy t - odd gauge bosons .     versus @xmath201 for different values of f , @xmath202 tev ( solid ) and @xmath203 tev ( dashed ) . 
 @xmath204 corrections are included to show the large @xmath201 behavior . ]    the leading order @xmath205 contribution to the effective hamiltonian that governs @xmath0 meson mixing from the t - even sector is given by @xmath206 ( \bar{s}d)_{v_a }    ( \bar{s } d)_{v - a},\ ] ] where @xmath207 and @xmath208 . 
 the parameter @xmath201 is a function of the couplings in eq . 
 ( [ topyuk ] ) : @xmath209 these corrections arise from two effects . 
 first , there are explicit new flavor changing diagrams which involve the partner of the top quark , @xmath78 . in addition 
 , the ckm matrix is modified at order @xmath172 in the @xmath210 elements .    to obtain these relations 
 , we have simply taken the limit of equal gauge couplings required by t - parity in the equations in  @xcite , and removed also the contributions from diagrams that violate t - parity . note that , because of those new conditions , imposing t - parity makes the t - even contributions somewhat smaller than those in the littlest higgs model without t - parity .    for regions of @xmath211 , where @xmath212 , we have to also consider formally order @xmath213 contributions , which increase linearly with @xmath214 . 
 these contributions come from box diagrams that contain two t - even partners of the top quark . 
 the leading behavior of these contributions is the same as that of the littlest higgs model without t - parity , given by  @xcite @xmath215    in figure  [ fig : t - even ] , we show the ratio @xmath216 as a function of @xmath201 at order @xmath204 , where @xmath217 is the sm contribution . in our analysis , we take @xmath218 , which corresponds to the point at which the @xmath78 mass is at its minimum . 
 this is also the point where the contributions to the higgs mass are minimized . for this ` natural ' value of @xmath201 , these t - even contributions are small ( less than @xmath219% of the sm contribution for @xmath202  tev ) , and can be neglected . 
 although t - even contributions could be very large in more fine - tuned regions of @xmath201 , we note that @xmath201 can not be arbitrarily close to 1 , in order not to violate direct search bounds on the t - odd top partner mass , @xmath220 ( as @xmath221 is increased , in order to hold the top quark mass fixed , @xmath222 must decrease , lowering the @xmath81 mass ) . 
 in addition , we want to keep @xmath221 from entering the strong coupling regime . 
 we leave a study which includes the effects of large @xmath201 for future work . 
 so far the expressions we have presented did not include qcd corrections . for the sm contributions 
 these corrections usually suppress the short distance predictions . 
 for example , the numerical values for the qcd corrections to the sm contributions are given by @xmath223 at nlo  @xcite . 
 a full nlo analysis for the new physics contributions would clearly be beyond the scope of this work , but as we will show below , we can account for the bulk of these corrections at leading order ( lo ) .    for the little higgs model with t - parity 
 we always match onto the same @xmath224 operator . 
 while the nlo value of the wilson coefficient at the high scale @xmath225 can not be determined without a full one loop calculation , the anomalous dimension will be the same as in the sm , as it depends only on the properties of the local operator . 
 this implies that we can immediately obtain @xmath226 , valid at lo . 
 we also need to address the issue of the choice of what to take for the high scale @xmath225 . 
 one might assume that @xmath227 is the best choice , but as we will explain below , we choose for our study @xmath228 .    * 
 while the masses of @xmath178 and @xmath177 are @xmath229 , the mass of @xmath86 is @xmath118 times smaller : @xmath230 , which for @xmath231 1000 gev is close to the top quark mass . 
 therefore for diagrams that involve @xmath86 we should use a scale lower than @xmath14 . 
 * the masses of the t - odd fermions are free parameters , so it is unclear which scale to use when integrating them out . 
 furthermore , since they couple to the gluons , their presence will lead to threshold effects which are functions of these masses and which greatly complicate the calculation . * 
 most importantly , the bulk of the qcd corrections result from running from the weak scale to the hadronic scale . since the variation of @xmath232 between the scales @xmath233 and 
 @xmath14 is rather small , neglecting these running and threshold effects is justified , considering the other uncertainties . 
 for example , in running up to @xmath234  gev from @xmath235 , the effect would only reduce @xmath147 by about @xmath236 .    considering these facts , and that there are uncertainties which would dominate these small effects , the common value for the qcd corrections that we adopt is then : @xmath237 in order to calculate the matrix element of the resulting effective hamiltonian 
 , we need to parametrize the matrix element of the four quark operator . 
 this calculation is precisely the same as in the sm as it only relies on physics at the low scale , and so the bag parameters are identical . 
 in this section , we show our numerical bounds on the t - odd fermion spectrum for some representative selection of textures for @xmath112 . we first consider cases where @xmath123 and @xmath112 are diagonal up to corrections that are of order the off - diagonal elements of @xmath238 . 
 we then analyze simple cases where the off - diagonal elements are allowed to be large . 
 we find in the former cases that some small gim suppression is necessary to satisfy experimental constraints . in the large mixing scenarios , 
 a strong gim suppression is necessary to avoid large contributions , and the t - odd fermion spectrum must be nearly degenerate . 
 the littlest higgs model is an effective field theory valid at most to the scale @xmath239 . as such 
 , there is no reason to suspect that one particular texture is favored over another . 
 however , if we begin from a basis where the t - odd dirac masses are diagonal , this leads to the relations @xmath240 , and @xmath241 . from this relation , 
 it is clear that , in this basis , all of the flavor and cp violating amplitudes arise as a result of the yukawa couplings which give mass to the sm fermions . 
 now the ckm matrix is given by @xmath242 . from this relation , 
 it is clear that @xmath122 and @xmath243 can not simultaneously be set to the identity . in this section 
 , we assume that both @xmath122 and @xmath243 are nearly equal to the identity matrix . 
 this is equivalent to assuming that there is an alignment mechanism between the t - odd masses and the sm yukawa structure . 
 this assumption provides us with a set of minimal mixing scenarios . 
 we take as examples two simple cases :    * * case i * @xmath244 , @xmath245 * * case ii * @xmath246 , @xmath247    in each of these scenarios , the only parameters relevant to neutral meson mixing are the mass eigenvalues of the t - odd fermions . in the first setup , the @xmath2 system is unaffected , and all constraints arise from neutral @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing . in the second 
 , there is no mixing in the down type gauge and goldstone boson interactions , and thus there are no contributions at one loop order in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems . 
 instead , the @xmath2 system gives the only constraints . 
 the one feature that these scenarios both share is a relative suppression mechanism that is borrowed from the sm ckm texture . 
 the smallness of @xmath248 and @xmath249 ensure that the neutral meson mixing amplitudes will be nearly independent of the mass of the third generation t - odd fermions . 
 the constraints will primarily be on the masses of the first two generations of t - odd fermions , because of the relatively larger values of @xmath250 and @xmath251 . 
 gev : in these plots , @xmath252 . in order of the darkest contours to lightest , the average mass of the first two generations varies through @xmath253 . 
 the @xmath2 system imposes no constraints in this scenario . ]    in finding the bounds on the mass eigenvalues of the t - odd fermion sector for a particular texture , we require that , for @xmath131 and @xmath0 mixing , the contribution from the t - odd fermions not exceed @xmath254 of the sm contribution to the mass splittings and @xmath148 . 
 this is roughly when the new physics contributions begin to exceed the long distance uncertainties associated with the sm predictions for these observables . 
 we note that this process eliminates the dependance on the bag parameters , which have rather large theoretical uncertainties . in the @xmath2 system 
 , there is only an experimental upper bound on the mass splitting , and the sm short distance contribution is very small compared with this bound . 
 thus , for the @xmath2 system we only require that the t - odd fermion contributions not exceed this experimental upper bound . 
 for every scenario , we hold the symmetry breaking scale @xmath14 fixed at @xmath255  gev . 
 the contributions from new physics simply scale as @xmath256 , so these results can easily be extended to other values of the breaking scale . in each plot , the horizontal axis is the ratio @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the average mass of the first two generations , and @xmath259 is the splitting @xmath260 . on the vertical axes we plot the dependence on the mass of the third generation t - odd quark doublet .    in figure 
 [ fig : casei ] , we show the constraints on the mass splitting of the first two generations of t - odd fermions as a function of the mass of the third generation t - odd doublet . 
 the regions of parameter space where the new physics contributions are smaller than the approximate long distance uncertainties in the sm contributions lie inside the shown contours . in this scenario 
 the up - type ckm , @xmath123 , is diagonal , and thus @xmath261 mixing has no contributions from new physics . 
 the features in the plot that cause the narrowing of the internal regions as @xmath262 varies away from @xmath258 are due to the influence of the @xmath148 observable . 
 if the cp violating phase @xmath263 is set to zero , the contours are nearly vertical . 
 gev : in this plot , we show the results for the case where @xmath246 . again , from darkest to lightest , the average mass of the first two generations increases as @xmath264 . in this scenario , 
 only the @xmath2 system is affected , and so the contours correspond to the points at which the t - odd fermion contributions exceed the experimental upper bounds . ]    in figure  [ fig : caseii ] , we set instead the down - type yukawa interactions to be diagonal . 
 as mentioned , the constraints in this region come only from the @xmath2 system mass splitting . 
 there are essentially no constraints on the mass of the third generation t - odd doublet . 
 the degeneracy required in the first two generations is quite relaxed , now varying between @xmath265 and @xmath69% as the average mass @xmath258 is increased . 
 we note , however , that this would change as the experimental bounds on the @xmath2 meson mass splitting are improved . 
 for example , if the bound on the mass splitting comes down by a factor of ten , the required degeneracy between the first two generations of t - odd fermions then varies between about @xmath266 and @xmath118% as @xmath258 varies between @xmath267 and @xmath268  gev . 
 as mentioned , another possibility for the textures is to have large off diagonal elements in @xmath112 . 
 there is no reason to assume that there is an alignment between the t - odd mass textures and the sm yukawa couplings . 
 we note that this requires that there are also , simultaneously , large off diagonal elements in @xmath123 which must cancel in the relation @xmath269 . 
 this is easy to realize in a natural way if most of this mixing comes in through the t - odd yukawa textures .    in this section 
 , we study the corrections that arise when the angles @xmath270 in eq . 
 ( [ newckm ] ) are taken to be large . in these cases , we find that not only is a degeneracy required between the first two generations , but the entire flavor spectrum of the t - odd vector - like quarks must often be degenerate . we consider four scenarios :    * * case iiia * @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 otherwise . * * case iiib * @xmath271 , @xmath274 , @xmath273 otherwise * * case iva * @xmath271 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath272 * * case ivb * @xmath271 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath274    in cases iiia and iiib , we allow one of the angles to be large . 
 we pick specifically @xmath277 to be large , as it is this angle to which the third generation mass dependence is sensitive . as @xmath148 is a strong factor in the analysis , we look at the case where it receives no contributions by setting @xmath263 to zero , relegating all new cp violation to the up - type quark interactions . in cases 
 va and vb , we chose some order one values for the three mixing angles , and again look at cases where the new cp violating phase is either all in the down - type , or all in the up - type quark interactions . 
 gev : in this plot , the angle @xmath271 , while the other angles are equal to the sm ckm angles .

 a large @xmath277 implies order one contributions to @xmath280 and @xmath281 . 
 it is clear from this figure that a degeneracy is now required in all three generations of t - odd fermions . for a generic choice of order one mixing angles 
 , it is expected that such a universally degenerate spectrum is required . 
 we show the results when the cp violating phase is set both to the sm value , @xmath282 , and to @xmath274 . 
 the dramatic difference between these two types of scenarios indicates the severe sensitivity of the @xmath148 observable to new flavor physics .    in figure 
 [ fig : bigall ] , we take all of the mixing angles to be somewhat large . 
 we find that this scenario is far more constrained then all the others if the phase @xmath272 . 
 there are some narrow windows where degeneracies of up to @xmath69% are allowed , but the majority of the parameter space where corrections are small is in the @xmath3% range . 
 however , when the angle @xmath263 is taken to be small , it happens that there is a cancellation in @xmath280 , such that the third generation mass @xmath262 is relatively unconstrained .

 however , there may be some special choices of textures that we have not considered that only strongly modify the @xmath5 system . 
 it is well known that this can occur in supersymmetry  @xcite . with this in mind , we have identified a texture that does not significantly affect @xmath0 and @xmath131 mixing , but which is able to enhance @xmath5 mixing . 
 a simple set of angles that achieves this is    * * case v * @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath274 . 
 the constraints from the other neutral meson systems are very weak here . 
 it is primarily the @xmath2 system which restricts the allowed parameter space . in this scenario , by varying the t - odd fermion masses within the allowed contours , the mass splitting in the @xmath5 system can be enhanced by as much as a factor of @xmath287 . 
 the constraints , along with a plot where we show the enhancement of the @xmath5 mass splitting for fixed @xmath288  gev are shown in figure  [ fig : bsmix ] . 
 it is interesting to note that the degeneracy required in the first two generations of t - odd fermions is more or less completely relaxed . 
 we emphasize that we have not performed an exhaustive search , and it is possible that there are other textures where the allowed enhancement of @xmath5 mixing is even larger .

 little higgs models with t - parity necessarily introduce new mirror fermions in order to cut off uv sensitive contributions to four - fermion contact operators that are constrained primarily by studies at lep . 
 these fermions introduce a new flavor structure to the model , and lead to new tree level flavor changing currents involving sm fermions and mirror fermions . 
 we have done a first exploratory study of this flavor structure , and found constraints on the mirror fermion mass spectrum from a one loop analysis of neutral meson mixing . we have noted that it is not possible to adjust all of the new flavor structure to be completely diagonal , due to relations with the ckm mixing already present in the sm .    for order one mixing parameters , we find that the mirror fermion mass spectrum must be degenerate to within a few percent or less . if the new mixing parameters are taken to be small , then this is significantly relaxed . in particular , 
 if all mixing is relegated to the up - type quark interactions , only @xmath2 mixing is affected , and a degeneracy of only @xmath265% or so is required between the first two generations of t - odd fermions . 
 we note that improved experimental constraints on the @xmath2 meson mass splitting could significantly restrict such scenarios . 
 we have found that the @xmath148 observable plays a significant role in the fits if there is a cp violating phase in @xmath112 . 
 we have also studied the @xmath5 system , identifying a scenario in which @xmath290 mixing can differ substantially from the sm prediction while still satisfying constraints on the other neutral meson mixing observables . in the setup 
 we have considered , the enhancement of the mass splitting can be as large as a factor of @xmath287 . 
 such scenarios are of particular interest for experimental studies of the @xmath5 system . also , in this scenario , the constraints on the first two generations are much more relaxed than in the others considered . 
 we wish to make clear that little higgs models with t - parity are not ruled out in any way by this study . 
 this analysis should instead serve as a guide to what properties any uv completion of this structure should have . 
 this is in close analogy with studies of the supersymmetric flavor problem , which have been an essential tool in constructing mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking which are consistent with low energy phenomenology . 
 we note that this is only an introduction to the flavor physics of this model . 
 there are many other observables which are sensitive to this flavor structure , such as rare decays and lepton flavor violating processes . including rare decay processes in an analysis 
 would possibly require a closer degeneracy in the mass spectrum , although this needs to be checked . 
 in addition , we have assumed that the sm ckm fit is unchanged , when in fact additional contributions to observables ( especially @xmath148 ) can change the best fit values of the ckm elements . 
 a full global analysis would remedy this situation , however many more observables must be computed and included to render such a fit meaningful .

 the gauge and yukawa interactions of the littlest higgs model with t - parity lead to tree level flavor changing currents which can , at one loop , affect sm observables such as neutral meson mixing . after identifying the mass eigenstates , 
 the lagrangian can be expanded , leading to the relevant feynman rules . 
 these rules are given in table  [ flavorrules ! ] . 
 while the conjugate interactions are not shown explicitly , they are easily derived . 
 one should note that the yukawa type interactions with the eaten goldstone bosons do not have an @xmath291 prefactor . because of this , the associated conjugate feynman rules have an additional minus sign .

 the function @xmath183 contains the contributions from the charged t - odd scalars and gauge bosons , while @xmath184 contains the contributions involving two @xmath177 propagators . 
 @xmath185 contains the contributions from diagrams with two @xmath86 propagators , while @xmath186 contains the contributions from diagrams with both a @xmath177 and an @xmath86 propagator running in the loop . 
 we note that in unitary gauge the expression for the @xmath183 function is not the same , and in fact contains divergent terms . 
 these cancel when the sum over flavors running in the box diagrams is performed , and unitarity of the mixing matrices is imposed . 
 it is only after this summation that the calculations in the two different gauges can be compared . 
 in contrast , the @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 functions which correspond to neutral current contributions are already gauge invariant .      n.  arkani - hamed , a.  g.  cohen and h.  georgi , phys .

11,"one of the promising directions of enhancement of the classical black 
 scholes model is construction and research of diffusion models with volatility of risky asset governed by a stochastic process . 
 empirical studies @xcite evidence in favor of the fact that the classical model with constant volatility is unable to capture important features of volatility observed in real financial markets . 
 this drawback of the black 
 scholes model has been widely investigated and to some extent eliminated by the extension of the theory in three directions : models with time - dependent deterministic volatility , models with state - dependent volatility , and models with stochastic volatility . 
 the first and second of these categories may be viewed as intermediate between the classical model and third category , although equipping the market with certain constraints ( the most essential is the limiting time period under consideration ) allow less complex models to produce results of acceptable precision .    despite recent popularity of the stochastic volatility modification of the black 
 scholes theory , the range of models under consideration is quite narrow . 
 one of the first models of such a type is presented in @xcite , where the authors assume the volatility of the price of risky asset to be governed by the square root of the geometric brownian motion . 
 an expression for the price of european call option is derived under the following assumption : the volatility process is driven by a brownian motion independent of the brownian motion governing the price of risky asset . in @xcite , the authors choose the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process to drive the volatility . 
 the ou process is mean - reverting , and there is a strong evidence that the volatility in real financial markets has such a feature @xcite . under this assumption , 
 the authors of @xcite describe the distribution of the price of risky asset and apply it to derive an estimate of the price of european call option . as an alternative 
 , there is an option to choose the cox  ingersoll 
 ross process to govern the volatility process @xcite . 
 it is worth mentioning that although all cited works contain some significant results , they rely upon simplified models of real - world volatility process ( e.g. , ignoring the mean - reversion property ) . 
 we remark that there is a vast amount of further investigations that consider more sophisticated and thus more realistic models . 
 an extensive overview of these results is given in @xcite . 
 nonnegativity is another desirable feature of the process modeling volatility . 
 one of possible choices is to use the exponential function of the ou process ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . 
 questions of existence of equivalent ( local ) martingale measures are investigated in different frameworks and different generality in @xcite . often , after specifying the model , the authors state that a risk - neutral measure exists and continue investigation in the risk - neutral world without defining the measure . 
 a significant part of works ( including aforementioned ) use the fourier transform to derive an analytical representation of the price of european call option . 
 a great deal of information about developments in application of the fourier transform to option pricing problems can be found in @xcite . 
 our work investigates the market defined by a diffusion model with stochastic volatility being an arbitrary function governed by the ornstein  uhlenbeck process . under general 
 setting and quite mild assumptions , we prove that the market satisfies two distinct no - arbitrage properties for different classes of trading strategies . 
 for the special case of uncorrelated wiener processes , we derive an analytical expression for the price of european call option . 
 this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we define a general model . in section  [ sec3 ] , we present definitions and preliminary results necessary for further analysis . in section  [ sec4 ] , we investigate matters of existence of equivalent ( local ) martingale measures and arbitrage properties of the general model . in section  [ sec5 ] , we define a particular case of the general model and raise the problem of pricing european call option . 
 section  [ sec6 ] covers the derivation of an  analytical expression for the option price . 
 let @xmath0 be a complete probability space with filtration generated by correlated wiener processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 . 
 we consider the model of the market where one risky asset is traded , its price evolves according to the geometric brownian motion @xmath4 , and its volatility is driven by a stochastic process . 
 more precisely , the market is described by the pair of stochastic differential equations    @xmath5    @xmath6    denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the deterministic initial values of the processes specified by eqs .  . 
 in sections  [ sec2][sec4 ] , we impose the following assumptions :    * the wiener processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are correlated with correlation coefficient @xmath11 $ ] , that is , @xmath12 ; * the volatility function @xmath13 is measurable , bounded away from zero by a constant @xmath14 , that is , @xmath15 and satisfies the conditions @xmath16 a.s . ; * the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are positive . 
 for example , the conditions mentioned in assumption ( a2 ) are satisfied for a  measurable function @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for @xmath22 and some constants @xmath23 . 
 moreover , given the square integrability of @xmath24 , the solution of the differential equation is given by @xmath25 which yields that @xmath26 is continuous . 
 hence , the product @xmath27 is square integrable : @xmath28 a.s 
 .    the unique solution of the langevin equation @xmath29 is the so - called ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process . 
 its properties make it a suitable tool for modeling the volatility in financial markets . 
 one of the most important features is the mean - reversion property . 
 the ou process is gaussian with the following characteristics : @xmath30=y_0\operatorname{e}^{-\alpha t } , \qquad \operatorname { var}[y_t]=\frac{k^2}{2\alpha}\bigl(1-\operatorname{e}^{-2\alpha t}\bigr).\end{aligned}\ ] ]    moreover , the ou process is markov and admits the explicit representation @xmath31    we can represent the process @xmath10 in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a wiener process independent of @xmath9 . in 
 what follows , we will use this representation . 
 notice that @xmath34 , where the filtration @xmath35 is generated by independent wiener processes @xmath9 and @xmath33 . 
 most of the information presented in this section can be found in more detail in @xcite ( and other references below ) . 
 we consider the market with one risky asset and one risk - free asset . 
 evolutions of prices of both assets are given by a semimartingale process @xmath36 and deterministic process @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 is a constant risk - free rate of return . 
 we introduce the discounted price process @xmath39 . 
 agents acting in the market may buy or sell risky asset and make their decisions concerning the structure of their portfolios basing upon the information available at the moment of decision . 
 this principle can be formalized by the following definition . 
 [ ts ] a trading strategy is a predictable process @xmath40 . 
 the value  @xmath41 of this process represents the amount of asset @xmath42 in a portfolio at time @xmath43 . 
 certain amount of preliminary concepts is necessary in order to introduce the essential notion of admissible self - financing strategy . 
 let a semimartingale  @xmath44 admit the decomposition @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a bounded - variation process , and @xmath47 is a local martingale . according , for example , to @xcite , p.  635 
 , there is a nondecreasing adapted ( to the filtration @xmath48 ) process @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and adapted processes @xmath51 and @xmath52 such that @xmath53 and the quadratic variation equals @xmath54_t=\int_0^t \hat{c}_s dc_s.\ ] ]    [ ts2 ] let @xmath55 be a predictable process . 
 we shall say that :    * @xmath56 if for all @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 , @xmath61 , if there exists a sequence of stopping times @xmath62 approaching @xmath63 as @xmath64 such that @xmath65^{q/2}<\infty;\ ] ] * @xmath66 if there exists a representation @xmath45 such that @xmath67

 [ ts4 ] an admissible strategy is said to be self - financing ( relative to the price process @xmath44 ) or , equivalently , @xmath69 if its value @xmath70 has a  representation @xmath71 . 
 further , we define two particular classes of trading strategies along with the corresponding classes of @xmath72-measurable pay - off functions @xmath73 that can be majorized by returns of strategies belonging to each class .

 now following the notation presented in @xcite , we proceed to the main definitions of absence of arbitrage . 
 [ naplus ] we say that the property @xmath93 ( or equivalently that the  market is @xmath93 ) holds if @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the subset of nonnegative random variables in @xmath96 .    [ nag ] we say that the property @xmath97 holds ( or equivalently that the  market is @xmath97 ) if @xmath98    there are two theorems that establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of arbitrage in the market in terms of equivalent ( local ) martingale measures . 
 an important condition that will be addressed further is the local boundedness of the price process . 
 [ emmeas ] a probability measure @xmath99 , which is equivalent to the objective measure @xmath100 , is called an equivalent ( local ) martingale measure if the discounted price process is a ( local ) martingale under the measure @xmath99 .    a stochastic process @xmath44 is called locally bounded if there exists a sequence @xmath101 of stopping times increasing a.s . to @xmath102 and such that the stopped processes @xmath103 are uniformly bounded for each @xmath104 .

 a minimal martingale measure is unique ( see @xcite ) . 
 in this section , we investigate the absence of arbitrage in the model . 
 notice that we further deal with an undiscounted process @xmath44 defined in section  [ sec2 ] . 
 the market defined by the model ( [ model0])([model1 ] ) with assumptions ( a1)(a3 ) :    * satisfies @xmath93 property ; * satisfies @xmath116 property , provided that for some elmm @xmath99 , @xmath117    \(i ) since @xmath44 is locally bounded due to its continuity , theorem  [ napluscriteria ] yields that in order to prove the first part of the theorem , it suffices to show that @xmath118 
 .    consider the process @xmath119 defined by with @xmath120 . 
 let @xmath121 . 
 in view of theorem  [ frey ] , it suffices to show that , under such a choice of  @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 it suffices to verify the novikov condition @xmath124    it follows from the boundedness away from zero of the function @xmath125 ( assumption ( a2 ) ) and our choice of @xmath122 that inequality holds . 
 hence , @xmath126 , which proves part ( i ) of the theorem . 
 \(ii ) now let us show that the measure @xmath99 from ( i ) is an emm . 
 denote @xmath127 . 
 knowing that the measure @xmath99 is equivalent to the measure @xmath100 and is defined by the radon  nikodym derivative @xmath128 , we may apply the girsanov theorem to derive that the processes @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , are wiener processes w.r.t .   @xmath132 . 
 the asset price process under the measure @xmath99 is a solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath133 which yields the following representation for the discounted price process @xmath134 : @xmath135    hence , provided that assumption ( a2 ) , as mentioned before , yields the square integrability of @xmath136 on @xmath137 $ ] , @xmath138 is a martingale . 
 therefore , @xmath139 , and by theorem  [ nagcriteria ] we deduce that the market @xmath140 is @xmath97 .    in order to prove @xmath97 and @xmath93 properties of the market 
 , we have proved the existence of one emm . 
 however , we actually have a family of equivalent martingale measures in the market . 
 the discounted price process is of the form   and thus is always a martingale given the square integrability of @xmath136 and any _ admissible _ choice of process @xmath122 .    let the market defined by ( [ model0])([model1 ] ) with assumptions ( a1)(a3 ) and additional condition ( [ sigma2x2 ] ) , and let the measure @xmath99 be such that @xmath141    then @xmath139 .    since we have more than one equivalent martingale measure in the market , it is straightforward that the market is incomplete . 
 each emm in the market is defined by the process @xmath142 associated with it . in the financial literature , the process @xmath143 is called the market price of volatility risk .    under the emm @xmath144 , the pair of processes @xmath145 has the following representation : @xmath146 where the processes @xmath147 are wiener processes w.r.t . 
 @xmath99 according to the girsanov theorem , and @xmath148 and  @xmath149 are independent .    in the risk - neutral model ( [ modelq ] ) , 
 the volatility process is not the ornstein  uhlenbeck process anymore . 
 so , generally speaking , there is no analytic solution to the corresponding differential equation . 
 therefore , we further consider a particular case of the general model , which is defined by a set of assumptions concerning the form and behavior of certain parameters of the model . 
 let us define a modified set of assumptions :    ( b1 ) the wiener processes @xmath150 and @xmath151 are independent , that is , @xmath152 ;    ( b2 ) @xmath153 ( a2 ) ;    ( b3 ) @xmath153 ( a3 ) . 
 assumption ( b1 ) simplifies the risk - neutral model to the following form : @xmath154 where @xmath155 are independent wiener processes w.r.t . 
 @xmath99 . 
 our purpose is to price a european call option in the model ( [ modelb ] ) . 
 we limit further investigation to the valuation w.r.t .  the minimal martingale measure . 
 the emm @xmath99 in the market defined by the model ( [ modelb ] ) is minimal iff the process @xmath122 corresponding to @xmath99 is identically zero . 
 suppose @xmath156 , @xmath157 $ ] . 
 let @xmath9 and @xmath148 be @xmath158-adapted wiener processes w.r.t . 
 measures @xmath100 and @xmath99 , respectively . 
 if @xmath159 is a square - integrable @xmath160-martingale , then we can apply the kunita 
 watanabe decomposition to derive @xmath161 where @xmath162    let @xmath163 be strictly orthogonal to @xmath164 . 
 then @xmath165 where @xmath166 , @xmath157 $ ] , a.s .. then for @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169    the process @xmath170 is a local @xmath100-martingale ; hence , @xmath159 is a local @xmath99-martingale . by definition @xmath99 
 is mmm . 
 the converse statement of the theorem comes straightforward from the uniqueness of mmm . 
 the solution of the differential equation defining the evolution of the price of asset has the following representation : @xmath171    for a fixed trajectory of @xmath172 , the argument of the exponential function in the right - hand side of is a gaussian process , and @xmath26 , @xmath173 , has the log - normal distribution with @xmath174 , where @xmath175 , @xmath131 . 
 this fact is crucial for the derivation of expression for the value of european call option .    the value of european call option at time 0 w.r.t . 
 the mmm is defined by the general formula @xmath176    we apply the telescopic property of mathematical expectation to transform the previous expression as follows : @xmath177    the inner expectation is conditional on the path of @xmath178 , and therefore , it is actually the black 
 scholes price for a model with deterministic time - dependent volatility . according to lemma 2.1 in @xcite , the inner expectation in has the following representation : @xmath179 where @xmath180 , and @xmath181 is the standard normal distribution function . 
 notice that @xmath182 . 
 the former notation may be viewed as the volatility averaged from the current moment to maturity , whereas the latter is the volatility averaged from the initial moment to the current one . 
 notice that the inner conditional expectation is an increasing function of  @xmath183 ( see lemma  3.1 in @xcite ) , which is the type of behavior one may expect to be exhibited by the black 
 scholes price of european call option . 
 taking into account the form of inner integral , in order to derive an analytic expression for the price of an option @xmath184 , it is necessary to deal with expectation of @xmath181 . instead of trying to evaluate the integral analytically 
 , it is possible to use the monte carlo method . 
 from eqs .    we can see that in order to derive the formula for the option price , it is necessary to present the exact formula for the expectation of @xmath181 . in this section 
 , we apply the inverse fourier transform after rearranging of the right - hand side of . 
 we introduce the following deterministic functions @xmath185 , @xmath186 : @xmath187 we define the domains of each of these functions to guarantee the nonnegativity of the expressions under square root , that is , @xmath188 for @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 for @xmath192 , @xmath193 . 
 [ ev0int ] suppose that the market is defined by the model ( [ modelb ] ) with assumptions ( b1)(b3 ) , @xmath99 is mmm , and @xmath184 is the price of european call option at time 0

12,"the study of low mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs yields useful information regarding the initial mass function near the bottom of the main sequence and below , the overall binary fraction of intermediate mass stars , and the long term stability and survivability of low mass objects in orbit about post - asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite . of particular interest is common envelope evolution and its consequences for any low mass companion . 
 understanding how low mass , unevolved companions fare inside and outside a common envelope is an easier task than distentangling binaries which have experienced two envelopes , such as double degenerates , and should provide insight into more complex binary evolution . 
 this paper presents the first results from a _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging survey of 90 candidate white dwarf + red dwarf binaries . 
 the goals of the study are to empirically test the bimodal distribution of orbital semimajor axes predicted by post - asymptotic giant branch binary evolution models , and to examine the distribution of companion masses as a function of current separation @xcite . 
 the prime focus of the present study is to image white dwarf + red dwarf pairs with sufficient spatial resolution to directly probe the @xmath0 au range . 
 specifically , models of orbital expanion due to adiabatic mass loss , combined with models of frictional inspiral within a circumbinary envelope , predict a gap between diminished ( @xmath1 au , @xmath2 yr ) and augmented ( @xmath3 au , @xmath4 yr ) orbits for low mass , unevolved companions to white dwarfs . a crude model of the expected distribution 
 is given in @xcite ; basically , companions originally within @xmath5 au are brought inward of 0.1 au , while those formerly outside this radius migrate farther by a factor of 3 . 
 the selected program stars , taken from and described in @xcite , are almost exclusively white dwarfs in @xcite which were found by @xcite to exhibit excess near - infrared emission in the 2mass point source catalog @xcite . 
 several additional targets of a similar nature were taken from @xcite . 
 white dwarfs with measured near - infrared flux above the photospheric contribution are strong candidates for harboring cool , low mass companions . 
 with radii of @xmath6 @xmath7 , low mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs ( @xmath6 @xmath8 ) can easily dominate the spectral energy distribution of the binary at red to near - infrared wavelengths , despite their low luminosities and low effective temperatures @xcite . 
 the target list for the white dwarfs discussed in this paper is given in table [ tbl1 ] . 
 the present data were taken with the acs @xcite high resolution channel ( hrc ) aboard _ 
 hst_. the observations at each target consisted of a small 4-point dither pattern with the f814w ( approximately @xmath9 band ) filter to such a depth as to reach signal - to - noise ( s / n ) @xmath10 on both the white dwarf and its suspected red dwarf companion . 
 these dithered frames were processed with multidrizzle to create a single combined , cosmic ray free image on which to perform astrometry and photometry . 
 each reduced image was visually inspected , and if two or more components were seen separated by @xmath11 , or if the candidate binary appeared to be a single unresolved point source , the analysis was as follows . for these single or well resolved multiple point sources , astrometry and aperture photometry 
 were performed with standard iraf tasks . 
 a few astrometric tasks were carried out with idp3 , which has the ability to determine the length and orientation of the major and minor axes in a gaussian profile fit . 
 both centroid and radial profile fits were executed for each star to determine its coordinates on the chip and to measure the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , as well as eccentricity . 
 radial profiles were fit using a @xmath12 ( 3 pixel ) radius , while photometry was carried out with a @xmath13 ( 5 pixel ) aperture radius . 
 corrections to the standard acs aperture , as well as appropriate sky annuli values , and color corrections , were taken from @xcite . 
 counts were converted into flux , then into vega magnitudes , and finally into cousins @xmath9 band magnitudes , all following the methods and calibrations of @xcite .    if a binary appeared resolved but with point - spread functions ( psfs ) separated by @xmath14 , then a different approach was used . in order to perform astrometry and photometry on these components with overlapping psfs , it was first necessary to remove the nearby companion flux individually for each star . 
 for this purpose , tinytim was used to generate acs psfs which were then processed with multidrizzle . 
 these multidrizzled psfs were interpolated , scaled , and subtracted in turn from each star of the binary systems to isolate one star at a time . 
 each binary component was then examined in the same manner as for single sources and resolved components as described above . however , after companion removal there were often residuals still contaminating aperture photometry out to @xmath15 pixels . for these close binary components , 
 an aperture of @xmath16 pixels was used and the measured flux was corrected to @xmath15 pixels using aperture corrections derived from all well - separated single point source science targets in the data set . 
 psf subtraction was performed in the manner described above for all science target point sources to search for faint , close companions . in a typical psf subtracted image , 
 the residuals contain some small structure which is likely attributable to imperfections in the artificial , multidrizzled psfs . 
 although the residuals were typically @xmath17% of the peak flux , this still might obscure any close companions at @xmath18 magnitudes . 
 there is an ongoing effort to improve the psf subtractions by : 1 ) performing the subtractions on the calibrated , flat fielded images and then multidrizzling the resultant images or ; 2 ) using real acs multidrizzled psfs rather than artificial ones . 
 table [ tbl1 ] lists all astrometry and photometry results for the 48 targets analyzed so far in the program . 
 the table is organized so that the first line for a given target provides data on the white dwarf and subsequent lines are the companion data . 
 the first column lists the white dwarf number from @xcite , and the second column lists an alternate name for the white dwarf or the companion name . 
 the third column contains `` yes '' if the components are totally or partially resolved in the acs observation , or `` no '' if unresolved . 
 the fourth column lists the fwhm in arcseconds for the airy disk from gaussian profile fitting , and the fifth column lists the ratio of the major to minor axes of the profile fit . 
 the sixth and seventh columns contain the separation in arcseconds and the position angle in degrees of the companion , if present . 
 the eighth and ninth columns list the photometry , in vega magnitudes , for the f814w filter and cousins @xmath9 band . 
 the last column lists system specific notes . 
 there are a several sources of photometric and astrometric errors for the data shown in table [ tbl1 ] . 
 first , there is the flux calibration error of the acs / hrc instrument , which is 0.5% @xcite . 
 second , there is the uncertainty in performing photometry on targets within calibrated , multidrizzled images . for targets with no neighbors within @xmath19 , 
 the photometric uncertainty is essentially the inverse of the s / n , which is @xmath20 4% for all 75 photometric targets 
 ( i.e. all white dwarfs and companions ) , and @xmath20 2% for all but 9 sources . 
 third , there is the error introduced by transforming the flux in the f814w bandpass to the cousins @xmath9 band , which according to @xcite is no more than a few percent . 
 fourth , there is the error introduced when photometry was executed on a target with a close ( @xmath21 ) companion . 
 after psf subtraction , a few companion point sources retained a very small amount of residual flux which fell into the @xmath16 pixel photometric aperture of the target star . 
 this is smaller than @xmath22% of the subtracted target s peak flux (  2.4 ) . 
 fifth , there is error introduced by using photometric apertures of @xmath16 pixels which were then corrected to @xmath15 pixels . 
 the standard deviations in these correction factors were @xmath23% , depending on aperture size and spectral type . 
 the end result of adding all of these photometric errors in quadrature is that : typical errors for isolated point sources are @xmath24 5% , while those for point sources with close companions are typically @xmath24 6% . 
 only relative astrometry between multiple system components has been perfomred in the study . 
 the astrometric errors for point sources without close companions are completely due to the uncertainty in centroiding , which is strictly a function of s / n . 
 these are typically @xmath20 0.04 pixels ( @xmath25 for s / n @xmath26 50 ) . for targets with close companions 
 , the measured centroid can be biased in the direction of the companion , if its flux is not removed by psf subtraction . 
 although the measured centroid uncertainty for these binary components had essentially the same range of errors as for single point sources , it is possible that small biases remained for targets contaminated by any positive or negative residual flux from its psf - substracted close companion . using @xmath22 pixel radii for centroiding and comparing the value obtained for a target with a close companion before and after psf subtraction of the companion 
 , shifts were measured that were no larger than 0.2 pixels ( @xmath27 ) . 
 the centroiding errors for components of close binaries are no larger than this shift . 
 as can be seen in figures @xmath28 and table [ tbl1 ] , there are 28 systems for which 2 or more objects were totally or partially resolved ( one of which is a previously known wide red dwarf companion that fell within the acs field of view and was itself resolved into 2 close components ) . generally speaking , the acs multidrizzled psfs at f814w had fwhms @xmath29 and were symmetric to within 5% of unity in the ratios of their major to minor axes by gaussian profile fits . 
 this allowed mostly resolved binaries with clearly separated airy disks to be imaged down to @xmath30 in separation at @xmath31 magnitudes between the components . for those binaries separated by @xmath32 ( 17 in all ) , 
 there was very little or no overlap between component psfs , and both the white dwarfs and red dwarfs were used to derive aperture corrections to be used for more closely separated pairs . 
 it should be noted that there are a few resolved binaries at separations @xmath33 , which , in principle , would be resolvable from the ground with good seeing . 
 the reason for this is that the sample was selected from unresolved 2mass point sources , where the beam size is approximately @xmath34 at @xmath35 band in the images provided by the archive server . 
 typically , equally luminous binaries at magnitudes @xmath36 mag can appear partially resolved in 2mass at separations of @xmath37 @xcite . however , the fact that most red dwarfs in this sample are @xmath22 magnitudes brighter than their white dwarf primaries at @xmath35 band makes it difficult or impossible to identify them as binaries in the 2mass images .      for imaged binaries separated by @xmath38 , there are two varieties : those in which two distinct airy disks are present and those in which there is a single , elongated airy disk . 
 pairs with two distinct psf cores were treated as described above , while those with elongated cores proved problematic during psf fitting and subtraction aimed at revealing individual point sources . 
 relative to the apparently single stars in the acs image set , these closest binaries all display significantly larger than normal residuals after single psf subtractions are performed , corroborating their binarity . 
 there are three systems ( 0949@xmath39451 , 1419@xmath39576 , 1631@xmath39781 ) whose 
 images show the presence of binaries with likely separations @xmath40 , corresponding to a single acs / hrc pixel . in all three cases , 
 the elongated airy disk is associated with the red dwarf component of a resolved binary ; i.e. , these systems are all triples . 
 this is a fortunate situation because in each case the white dwarf component can be used as a comparison psf . 
 these systems are described in  3.7 . 
 the separations of these very close binary systems were estimated in the following manner . 
 all the measured psfs in table [ tbl1 ] show some very minor elongation that is typically on the order of one milliarcsecond . 
 specifically , the difference between the major and minor axes of the gaussian profile fits is typically @xmath41 mas . for the three close doubles , these differences , or elongations , lie in the range @xmath42 mas . 
 equally luminous components were assumed and the separation of the binary was taken to be its elongation . 
 of course , if the pair is not equally bright , then the separation will be slightly larger , but contour plots of all three objects display a high degree of symmetry along the major axes , consistent with equal luminosity .    without spatially resolved spectra of the close binary components of these triple systems 
 , it can not be firmly concluded that all three are double red dwarfs . 
 it is likely that only one of the systems will be observable from the ground as a spectroscopic target that is spatially resolved from its white dwarf primary . 
 therefore , it may be difficult ( or impossible ) to know with certainty the nature of the two close components in the remaining two systems . 
 however , depending on the actual orbital period , it may be possible with radial velocity monitoring to confirm the nature of these candidate double red dwarfs from the ground over a period of one to a few years . 
 none of the other 24 spatially resolved white dwarf + red dwarf pairs have separations as small as the three targets with elongated airy disks , and it is a safe assumption ( for reasons discussed in  4 ) that these are double red dwarfs . 
 there are 15 systems in table [ tbl1 ] for which there is strong photometric evidence , and often spectroscopic evidence , for the presence of an unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf pair . 
 in fact , a thorough literature search beyond @xcite reveals that a few of these systems are recently ( since their selection as targets for this program ) discovered da+dme systems , radial velocity variables , or low mass ( he core , @xmath43 @xmath44 ) white dwarfs  all of which imply binaries with separations @xmath45 au @xcite , consistent with single point sources in the acs observations . in any case , all of these stars have composite optical and near - infrared colors perfectly consistent with white dwarf and red dwarf components @xcite . 
 for these binaries , it was necessary to calculate the flux contribution of the white dwarf in order to subtract it and obtain the flux of the red dwarf companion . 
 this was done utilizing techniques discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and  3.6 , where particular attention was given to avoid biasing the calculations by excluding white dwarf data which may have been contaminated by the cool companion star . 
 there were 6 targets (  3.7 ) for which the evidence of binarity was based on low s / n ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) @xmath48 data in the 2mass point source catalog . 
 these were included in the hst / acs survey as low priority targets and do not belong to the sample of highly probable white dwarf + red dwarf binaries . as yet , none of these targets have revealed companions in the acs observations . 
 any study of stellar multiplicity must address the likelihood of physical association between putative companions . 
 there are several reasons why all the targets designated here as multiples have a very high probability of being gravitationally bound . 
 the first and foremost is spatial proximity  the white dwarf targets are associated with a single point source in 2mass images . 
 second , the combination of optical and near - infrared colors yields photometric distance ranges for each component that overlap when appropriate , mundane white dwarf and red dwarf stellar parameters are assumed . 
 third , some of the systems imaged in this study have published references listed in tables @xmath49 containing spectroscopic confirmation of their red dwarf companions in unresolved , composite observations , and/or previously established common proper motion . 
 fourth , common proper motion is almost certain for all posited multiples over the timescales since the identification of the white dwarf component @xmath50 years ago ; otherwise any false pairs should separate when `` blinking '' images available through the digitized sky survey ( e.g. , in the northern hemisphere , the first and second epoch palomar observatory sky survey plates ) . 
 fifth , there exist several white dwarf + red dwarf studies which have established spectroscopic and/or common proper motion confirmation for numerous targets of a nearly identical nature @xcite . 
 therefore , the multiple stellar systems presented here should be regarded as physically associated until shown otherwise .      to determine the projected companion separations in astronomical units , distances to each binary had to be assessed . 
 table [ tbl2 ] lists the stellar parameters from the literature for the white dwarf primaries in table [ tbl1 ] . 
 the first column contains the white dwarf number , followed by effective temperature , surface gravity , apparent visual magnitude , photometric distance , and references . 
 a single digit following the decimal place for log @xmath51 indicates an assumption of @xmath52 @xmath44 . 
 the @xmath53 magnitude is either a value uncontaminated by the red dwarf or one derived ( based on effective temperature and models , magnitudes and colors in other filters , or photographic magnitudes and colors ; @xcite ) to more correctly reflect the likely uncontaminated value . 
 distances were calculated from absolute magnitudes for individual white dwarfs , using the models of @xcite as well as specified references in table [ tbl2 ] . 
 less than half of the white dwarf targets in table [ tbl2 ] have well - determined stellar parameters ( i.e. , @xmath54 , log @xmath51 ) in the literature and , hence , fairly reliable distance estimates . for these well - studied white dwarfs 
 there are published parameters based on data ( typically spectra , but also photometry where available ) and analyses which are not contaminated or biased by the light from their red dwarf companions . 
 fortunately , most if not all ground - based white dwarf studies are performed in the @xmath55   range , where most red dwarfs should not contribute significantly . 
 however , there are plenty of cases where flux is seen at these wavelengths and this has been taken into account in table [ tbl2 ] and often by authors in the corresponding references . 
 for the remainder of the targets , published white dwarf parameters do not exist at present ; mccook & sion ( 1999 and references therein ) sometimes contain @xmath56 or other optical photometry , but frequently there is only a single photographic magnitude and/or a spectral type with no temperature index . 
 therefore , at worst , the values in table [ tbl2 ] represent conservative best guesses  assuming parameters which would make the white dwarf and any companion typical  but more often they are guesses informed by available data . some of the ways in which the effective temperatures and visual magnitudes were estimated for white dwarf targets include : ( 1 ) published @xmath57 color , which is unlikely to be contaminated by a cool companion ; ( 2 ) the implied color indices ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) for any white dwarf which was resolved from its companion in the acs observations ; ( 3 ) information on the colors and spectral type of the companion star from 2mass data , acs photometry , or other literature sources ; ( 4 ) any published optical spectrum revealing one or both of the binary components ( but without parameter determinations ) . 
 generally , for each target all available information was gleaned from the usno - b1.0 @xcite , 2mass all - sky point source @xcite , and supercosmos sky survey catalogs @xcite to assist in constraining and disentangling binary component stellar parameters . 
 although photographic photometry can have large absolute calibration errors , typically @xmath59 mag , resultant colors tend to be as accurate as @xmath45 mag for the magnitude range spanned by the white dwarf targets here @xcite and can be useful in a number of ways . 
 any colors assist in the assessment of where the flux of the red dwarf begins to dominate the spectral energy distribution of the binary , which is typically shortward of 8000  . 
 if published optical photometry or spectra were suspected of contamination ( i.e. , effective temperature underestimated in the literature ) then adjustments using model colors based on a more likely ( conservative ) temperature were made . in this way , 
 the best available data and estimates were used for all targets in order to constrain white dwarf parameters and subsequently deconvolve any composite @xmath60 data to obtain colors and magnitudes for red dwarf companions , following methods described fully in @xcite and @xcite . where model white dwarf parameters were needed , they were taken from @xcite and p. bergeron ( 2002 , private communication ) . where empirical red dwarf parameters were needed , they were taken from @xcite and @xcite .    a separate but related issue is the identification of the hot and cool components for the numerous binaries resolved in the acs observations . utilizing techniques discussed above , and because in almost every case there was a significant brightness difference ( @xmath61 mag ) between the components , there is high confidence that the white dwarf component was correctly identified in the acs images ( possible exceptions are discussed in  3.7 ) . specifically , the implied @xmath62 color of the red dwarf and the @xmath63 color of the white dwarf are consistent only if the components were correctly identified ; reversing identities leads to contradictions . 
 additionally , the acs camera scatters light at red wavelengths , yielding significant haloes for all bright objects ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) , and broadening the psf of any red objects relative to blue objects @xcite . 
 the measured psf sizes in table [ tbl1 ] reflect this phenomenon , with a single possible exception discussed in  3.7 . despite apparent good agreement and reassurance that the individual components have been correctly identified , it is by no means absolute . in a few cases , it is possible that an apparently single , resolved binary component is itself an unresolved double red dwarf binary or white dwarf + red dwarf binary . 
 tables [ tbl3 ] and [ tbl4 ] list the measured and derived parameters of the red dwarf companion stars . in the first column 
 is the white dwarf number followed by the companion name . 
 the third column contains the spectral type estimate based on the @xmath62 color listed in the fourth column . 
 the fifth column lists the photometric distance to the red dwarf based on empirical m dwarf data @xcite . 
 it should be mentioned that the white dwarf distance estimates listed in table [ tbl2 ] do not always agree with the implied distance to the red dwarf from absolute magnitude - spectral type relations @xcite . 
 there are several reasons why this might happen : ( 1 ) the white dwarf has a mass significantly above or below the typically assumed 0.60 @xmath44 value for field da stars ; ( 2 ) the effective temperature of the white dwarf has been poorly estimated ; ( 3 ) the spectral type of the red dwarf has been poorly estimated ; ( 4 ) either the white dwarf or red dwarf is itself an unresolved binary ; ( 5 ) the intrinsic width of the lower main sequence in a hertzsprug - russell ( or reduced proper motion ) diagram is at least @xmath64 magnitude , the slope is steep , and placement of a component depends upon both metallicity and age . 
 this alone can impose on the order of @xmath65 magnitudes of apparent discrepancy with the white dwarf estimate when photometric distances are all that is available . 
 these are some of the reasons why spectral type estimation was based on color , not on any absolute magnitude implied by the ( often nominal ) photometric distance to the white dwarf @xcite .    in principle , obtaining a good photometric distance to nearly all the white dwarfs in the sample is feasible , since the bulk are da white dwarfs which can be spectroscopically fit sans contamination ( by avoidance if necessary ) in the @xmath66   region for @xmath54 and log @xmath51 . 
 however , a similar spectroscopic assessment is not possible for the red dwarf secondaries ; spectral types can be determined to limited accuracy by subtracting the expected white dwarf contribution over @xmath67  , but the equivalent of a stellar radius ( log @xmath51 ) determination does not exist . 
 using empirical absolute magnitude - spectral type relations is likely to prove reliable in most cases ( assuming knowledge of an accurate spectral type ) ; however , there is intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitudes for a given red dwarf spectral type , potentially compounded up to @xmath68 magnitudes by metallicity and/or multiplicity @xcite . for comparison and completeness , 
 the red dwarf distance from color - magnitude relations is also listed in the tables .      _ 
 0023@xmath39388 _ is more likely closer to @xmath69 pc than 24 pc as suggested by references in @xcite . 
 the distance underestimate is likely due to the unresolved red dwarf causing the white dwarf to appear redder , cooler and , hence , nearer @xcite .    _ 
 0131@xmath70163 _ is a singular case in which it was difficult to distinguish which resolved star is the white dwarf or red dwarf . 
 the parameters in table [ tbl3 ] present the most consistent scenario , but a full optical spectrum and multiband photometry should be able to reveal which star contributes more flux around 8000  .    _ 
 0208@xmath70153 _ is the only resolved pair in which the psf widths do not follow the pattern of @xmath71 . 
 the reason for this is unclear , but given the fact that acs scatters more light for redder objects , this white dwarf could conceivably harbor an unresolved red companion .    _ 
 0237@xmath39115 , 0347@xmath70137 , 1218@xmath39497 , 1333@xmath39005 , and 1458@xmath39171 _ all appear to have discrepancies betwen the distances implied by the ( sometimes inferred ) brightness of the white dwarf and red dwarf binary components . 
 many of the white dwarfs have reliable log @xmath51 determinations @xcite but the cool companion appears too bright for its color and , hence , may be a binary . in other cases , the white dwarf may be overluminous ( or the red dwarf may be underluminous ) . 
 these cases are those that stand out presently , but spectroscopic observations ( which are currently being obtained ) may resolve them .    _ 0324@xmath39738 _ has many measurements in @xcite and the current online version of that catalog that are either contaminated by nearby background stars or were performed on the wrong stars . 
 recently published values of @xmath72 k and an extremely low mass @xcite are also likely due to the same phenomenon , as the white dwarf is currently moving between two background stars and has a nearby ( @xmath73 ) red dwarf common proper motion companion ( which is incorrectly identified as the white dwarf by coordinates in @xcite and finder charts provided in the current online version of that catalog ) . 
 these four stars are all currently within a @xmath74 radius of one another . for the present work , 
 the correct stars were identified by using digitized sky survey images to confirm the pair by their common proper motion over 40 years and by their photographic magnitudes , colors and positions in the usno - a2.0 , usno - b1.0 , and 2mass catalogs @xcite . from the acs images , 
 the white dwarf has coordinates of @xmath75 while the brighter component of the double red dwarf ( resolved in the observations ) is located at @xmath76 , both epoch 2005.09 . 
 using @xcite and the acs data gives @xmath77 for the white dwarf and ( if correct ) together with its measured parallax of @xmath78 would give @xmath79 k and log @xmath80 ( @xmath81 @xmath44 ) . 
 the properly identified white dwarf does not have any published , accurate , and uncontaminated near - infrared data and , hence , there is currently no evidence for any close ( i.e. unresolved by acs ) , cool companion .    _ 
 1133@xmath39489 _ is the same object as sdss j113609.59 + 484318.9 for which @xcite recently determined that the white dwarf is a db star with @xmath82 k , despite the presence of he ii absorption at 4686   in their spectrum , together with an m6 or later companion . 
 the white dwarf was found to be a composite white dwarf by @xcite and @xcite who correctly determined the primary to be a type do star with @xmath83 k plus a cool companion . however 
 , a companion as late as m6 would place this system at a distance of about 166 pc based on @xmath84 from 2mass , implying @xmath85 mag for the white dwarf and a mass @xmath86 @xmath44 . 
 the present analysis finds the @xmath62 color of the companion gives a spectral type of m5 , consistent if the white dwarf has log @xmath87 ( @xmath88 @xmath44 ) .    _ 1247@xmath39550 , 2211@xmath39372 , 2323@xmath39256 , and 2349@xmath70283 _ are all low priority targets whose 2mass photometry in the second incremental data release , despite low s / n at @xmath48 , suggested near - infrared excess @xcite . 
 some of these targets have @xmath84 data in the all sky point source catalog which differ significantly from the preceeding catalog values @xcite . 
 none of these white dwarfs show any evidence of companions in the acs images , and until more accurate near - infrared photometry is available , binarity should be considered unlikely .    _ 
 1517@xmath39502 _ is a rare da+dc ( white dwarf + dwarf carbon star ) system @xcite which remained unresolved in the acs observation . 
 the expected magnitude difference at @xmath9 band is 1.05 mag ; thus , conservatively speaking , a separation of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 au ) can likely be ruled out .    _ 
 1603@xmath39125 _ is listed in @xcite as a possible magnetic white dwarf , type dah . 
 based on the deconvolved , @xmath91 , color for the companion , a spectral type of k3 is inferred . 
 this places the system at @xmath92 pc and implies that the primary is very likely an sdb star with @xmath93 mag @xcite .    _ 
 1619@xmath39525 _ displays three objects within a @xmath94 radius on the acs images ; their separations and magnitudes are listed in table [ tbl1 ] . 
 the photometry was performed with color and aperture corrections appropriate for one white dwarf and two red dwarfs of the implied intrinsic faintness and color . 
 if this is a physical triple , then the ratio of the projected separations is 5.6 to 1 . 
 the companionship of the two brighter stars is quite firm as the elongated pair can be seen on at least 2 digitized sky survey images , almost certainly comoving over 43 years . 
 the third candidate companion lies within @xmath19 of the white dwarf , which is located at @xmath95 . 
 hence , they are quite likely to be physically associated . 
 additionally , the candidate third component appears quite red , as would be expected of a late m dwarf ; the 2mass images are elongated at @xmath96 , and especially at @xmath48 , along the correct position angle . 
 this is consistent if the tertiary candidate is a companion because , although the brightness difference of the two red dwarfs is 2.8 magnitudes at @xmath9 band , it should become @xmath97 magnitudes in the near - infrared if the two contributing components are around m5 and da2.8+m7 @xcite . 
 attempts to deconvolve the 2mass magnitudes into two components failed , however , and the 2mass photometry may be inaccurate due to the presence of two objects ( the white dwarf should contribute very little in the near - infrared ) . 
 ground - based followup should conclusively demonstrate that this system is a da2.8+dm5+dm7 ( approximate m types ) triple system .    _ 
 1631@xmath39781 _ is a triple system with a well - resolved red dwarf companion which is itself a barely resolved double . 
 this system is mentioned in 47 papers in the literature since its discovery by @xcite , at least 12 of which mention or discuss its nature as a precatacylsmic variable or post - common envelope binary . 
 however , both @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the unlikelihood that the main binary lies in a close orbit by finding an absence of radial velocity variability in the balmer emission lines from the companion . 
 @xcite added the possibility that the system is face on or has low enough inclination to preclude significant variations in radial velocity as seen from earth . 
 @xcite conclude that the system is not face on from a positive detection of rotational broadening ( @xmath98 km s@xmath99 ) in the red dwarf at several lines in a high resolution optical spectrum . 
 given that all components of the triple system are seen in the acs image , it is entirely possible that this system has a low inclination , and the line broadening reported by @xcite might be due in part or in whole to the binarity of the red dwarf component . 
 somewhat surprisingly , @xcite lists this system among all known detached , post - common envelope binaries with known periods , citing @xcite who report x - ray variability with a period of @xmath100 hours and a false - alarm probability of 4.4% . 
 since the main binary is quite widely separated , the source of the x - ray variations are either intrinsic to the hot degenerate star itself ( i.e. , perhaps a starspot ) as seen in other single white dwarfs @xcite , or flare activity from one or both components of the red dwarf pair @xcite . in any case , two things are clear from the acs data . first , this system never shared a common envelope , as the current projected separation of the double red dwarf from the primary is 17 au ( @xmath101 years ) . 
 second , all the documented optical emission features arise from activity within the double red dwarf system , either intrinsic to one or both of the stars ( interactions are unlikely at @xmath102 au , @xmath103 days ) .    _ 
 1845@xmath39683 _ is a hot white dwarf ( @xmath104 mag , @xmath105 k ; see references in table [ tbl2 ] ) reported as a binary in both @xcite and @xcite . 
 it is likely that the second reference is merely pointing to the work presented in the first reference , as there exists no other discoverable discussion of suspected binarity of this white dwarf in the literature . 
 the 2mass catalog gives @xmath106 mag , @xmath107 mag , and an upper limit of @xmath108 mag for the white dwarf , which are consistent with a single star of the appropriate effective temperature , and also consistent with the acs @xmath9 band magnitude . 
 @xcite have @xmath109 mag and @xmath110 mag which apparently corresponds to a field star located @xmath111 away at @xmath112 , which has 2mass photometry of @xmath113 mag , @xmath114 mag , and @xmath115 mag , all with s / n @xmath116 . 
 all this suggests that the white dwarf is neither a suspected nor confirmed binary .    _ 
 2151@xmath70015 _ contains a resolved m8 dwarf , the coolest companion resolved in the survey so far . 
 the identity of the white dwarf and red dwarf components are firm from ground - based @xmath117 images , where the m star is seen partially resolved only at @xmath9 @xcite . 
 however , the white dwarf exhibits a significant halo in the acs image which is unexpected for a @xmath118 k object , and not seen in other white dwarf primaries  even those with unresolved , spectroscopically confirmed , late m dwarf companions such as 0354@xmath39463 ( rubin 80 , da6+dm7 ; @xcite ) . 
 while this may simply be the result of the fact that the primary is relatively bright compared to the other resolved white dwarfs , it might be due to a third , unresolved , even cooler component . 
 this hst / acs survey was specifically designed to search for white dwarf + red dwarf binaries separated by around one to a few au . 
 theory predicts , and extant observations support , a bimodal distribution of orbital separations in which low mass companions vacate this region during the post - main sequence evolution of the white dwarf progenitor @xcite . 
 specifically , companions within a few au should interact both directly and tidally with the agb slow wind and expanding photosphere , imparting some of their angular momentum to the envelope and arriving eventually at closer orbital semimajor axes . 
 those companions originally outside of a few au should eschew the agb envelope and experience an expansion of their orbital semimajor axes by a factor proportional to the total amount of mass lost there is no a priori reason to believe that the phase space around @xmath119 au should be utterly devoid of low mass main sequence companions to white dwarfs . 
 in fact , there should be some real width in both peaks of the actual bimodal distribution of separations , each with tails overlapping the `` forbidden '' range of semimajor axes . 
 figure [ fig6 ] displays the sensitivity of the survey to companions in the few au range . here 
 , two assumptions are used ; 1 ) @xmath120 sensitivity , for companions at @xmath121 mag and 2 ) @xmath122 sensitivity , for companions at @xmath123 mag . 
 these assumptions are conservative , especially given the performed psf subtractions . 
 all targetted binary candidates are expected to have flux ratios corresponding @xmath124 mag in the f814w filter . 
 figure [ fig7 ] shows the distribution of projected separations for detected companions and upper limits for unresolved binaries . 
 so far , no white dwarf + red dwarf systems have been resolved at separations around a few au . 
 the ability of this survey to detect binaries of comparable luminosity at such separations is demonstrated by both figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , plus the three very close binaries ( likely double red dwarfs ) in table [ tbl5 ] , implying that pairs separated by as little as 1 au at @xmath125 pc were at least partially resolvable . 
 although accurate distances are needed for the sample stars to confirm these preliminary findings , there are not yet any ambiguous cases where a reasonable change in the distance to the binary would bring the separation into the few au range 
 .    if these initial conclusions are correct , these data are the first empirical evidence for the bimodal distribution of low mass , unevolved companions to white dwarfs . 
 this would also imply that as many as 100% of the 15 unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf pairs are in close orbits , and good candidates for radial velocity variables . 
 if the first half of this survey is representative of the whole , it should be expected that this program will eventually resolve around 55 total wide binaries , and identify around 30 total binaries that are candidate radial velocity variables . 
 followup work is currently being carried out for all program stars for which a good photometric distance determination ( i.e. , reliable @xmath56 photometry , @xmath54 , and log @xmath51 ) does not exist in the literature . in order to assess the physical separations of the low mass companions in au , 
 an accurate distance is required . 
 combined with the near - infrared data , optical photometry and spectroscopy should allow a complete determination of stellar parameters for these binary and triple systems . 
 stellar parameters are not only needed to determine distance and separation for these binaries , but also to study the system components themselves . 
 another goal of this survey is to compare the masses ( via spectral types ) of the red dwarf companions in wide , resolved systems versus those in unresolved , likely post - common envelope systems . given enough stars in both categories , a statistical analysis can be made of the resulting spectral type ( and , by proxy , mass ) distributions to see what effect , if any , common envelope evolution has had on the secondary masses @xcite

13,"ricci curvature lower bounds for riemannian manifolds play a crucial role in differential geometry , but also in probability theory and analysis . 
 in particular , such bounds are known to imply important properties of brownian motion on the manifold . 
 for example , positive curvature bounds imply several useful functional inequalities ( logarithmic sobolev inequality , poincar inequality ) , as well as exponential rates of convergence to equilibrium . such results were first obtained using the celebrated bakry  mery approach developed in @xcite .      in @xcite and 
 @xcite a notion of ricci curvature bounds for markov chains was introduced , based on convexity properties of the relative entropy along geodesics in the space of probability measures over the state space , for a well - chosen metric structure . 
 it is the discrete analogue of the synthetic notion of ricci curvature bounds in geodesic metric - measure spaces obtained in the contributions of lott 
 villani @xcite and sturm @xcite .    the main observation behind the lott  villani 
 sturm definition of ricci curvature bounds is that , on a riemannian manifold @xmath0 , the ricci curvature is bounded from below by some constant @xmath1 if and only if the boltzmann  shannon entropy @xmath2 is @xmath3-convex along geodesics in the @xmath4-wasserstein space of probability measures on @xmath0 . 
 however , this definition is not well adapted to discrete spaces , because the @xmath4-wasserstein space over a discrete space does not contain any geodesic .    to circumvent this issue 
 , @xcite and @xcite introduced a different metric @xmath5 . 
 this metric is built from a markov kernel in such a way that the heat flow associated to this kernel is the gradient flow of the entropy with respect to the distance @xmath6 . 
 this is an analogue of the continuous situation , where it has been proven by jordan , kinderlehrer and otto in @xcite that the heat flow on @xmath7 is the gradient flow of the entropy with respect to the wasserstein metric . a markov chain 
 is then said to have ricci curvature bounded from below by some constant @xmath3 if the relative entropy ( with respect to the invariant probability measure of the chain ) is @xmath3-convex along geodesics for the metric @xmath5 . 
 it has been shown in @xcite that a ricci curvature lower bound has significant consequences for the associated markov chain , such as a ( modified ) logarithmic sobolev inequality , a talagrand transportation inequality and a poincar inequality . 
 therefore , it is desirable to obtain sharp ricci curvature bounds in concrete discrete examples . to this day , there are very few results of this type . 
 mielke @xcite obtained ricci curvature bounds for one - dimensional birth and death processes , and applied these bounds to discretizations of 1-dimensional fokker 
 planck equations . 
 erbar and maas @xcite proved a tensorization principle : the ricci curvature lower bound for a product system is the minimum of the ricci curvature bounds of the components . 
 this property is crucial for applications to high - dimensional problems . 
 as a special case , the result yields the sharp ricci bound for the discrete hypercube @xmath8 . 
 the first high - dimensional results beyond the product - setting have been recently obtained by erbar , maas and tetali  @xcite , who obtained ricci curvature bounds for the bernoulli  laplace model and for the random transposition model on the symmetric group .    in spite of this progress , 
 a systematic method for obtaining discrete ricci curvature bounds has been lacking . in this paper 
 , we present such a method , which allows us to obtain curvature bounds for several interacting particle systems on the complete graph . 
 the method allows us to recover all of the above - mentioned results , and yields new curvature bounds for zero - range processes on the complete graph .      to explain our method , 
 let us recall that the discrete ricci curvature bounds considered in this paper correspond to bounds on the second derivative of the entropy along @xmath9-geodesics . in the continuous setting , on a riemannian manifold @xmath10 , the second derivative of the entropy along a @xmath11-wasserstein geodesic @xmath12 is formally given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 \times{\mathcal{m}}\to{\mathbb{r}}$ ] satisfies the continuity equation @xmath15 and the hamilton 
 jacobi equation @xmath16 therefore , it follows at least formally that a lower bound @xmath17 implies @xmath3-convexity of the entropy along geodesics .    in the discrete case , 
 the second derivative of the entropy along geodesics is given by an expression @xmath18 which somewhat resembles the right - hand side of ( [ eq : second - derivative ] ) , but the dependence on @xmath19 is more complicated . 
 unfortunately , there does not seem to be a suitable discrete analogue of bochner s formula . 
 in this paper , we present an approach to get around this difficulty . 
 we obtain a convenient lower bound for the second derivative of the entropy , which turns out to be very useful ; see theorem  [ thmm : curv - crit ] below . 
 this expression has the same features as the right - hand side of bochner s formula ( [ eq : bochner ] ) : one of the terms is nonnegative and contains only second - order ( discrete ) derivatives , while the other terms contain only first - order derivatives . 
 the expression is remarkably flexible , since it allows us to derive sharp ricci bounds in the rather diverse examples mentioned above . 
 the work of caputo , dai pra and posta @xcite which inspired this paper , fits very naturally into this framework . in order to obtain 
 modified logarithmic sobolev inequalities , these authors followed the bakry  mery strategy , which consists of computing the second derivative of the entropy along the `` heat equation '' @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the generator of a reversible markov chain . it can be checked that this second derivative can be expressed as @xmath22 
 . therefore , the bounds obtained in @xcite and @xcite are a special case of the bounds on @xmath18 , which we obtain for arbitrary @xmath23 . 
 we refer to section  [ sec : bak - eme ] for more details .      in section  [ sec : pre ] , we collect preliminaries on discrete transport metrics , the associated riemannian structure , and the notion of discrete entropic ricci curvature . 
 section  [ sec : method ] contains the general criterion for ricci curvature bounds . 
 various examples are studied in section  [ sec : examples ] . 
 the states a few useful properties of the logarithmic mean that are used in the proofs .    throughout the paper 
 , we use the probabilistic notation @xmath24 = \pi\bigl[f(\eta)\bigr ] = \sum_{\eta\in{\mathcal{x } } } f(\eta ) \pi(\eta).\ ] ] 
 in this section , we briefly recall some basic facts on the discrete transportation metric @xmath9 , which plays a crucial role in the paper . this metric has been introduced in @xcite in the setting of finite markov chains , and ( independently ) in @xcite for reaction  diffusion systems . 
 closely related metrics have been considered in @xcite in the setting of fokker 
 planck equations on graphs . 
 our discussion follows @xcite with a slightly different normalisation convention ( see also @xcite ) . 
 we work with a discrete , finite space @xmath25 and a markov generator @xmath21 , acting on functions @xmath26 by @xmath27 the transition rates @xmath28 are nonnegative for all distinct @xmath29 , and we use the convention that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 . 
 we assume that @xmath32 is _ irreducible _ , that is , for all @xmath33 , there exists a sequence @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . 
 it is a basic result of markov chain theory that there is a unique stationary probability measure @xmath39 on @xmath25 , which means that @xmath40 we shall always assume that @xmath39 is _ reversible _ for @xmath32 , that is , the detailed balance equations @xmath41 hold for all @xmath42 
 . we shall refer to @xmath43 as a markov triple . 
 let @xmath44 be the set of _ probability densities _ on @xmath25 ( with respect to the stationary measure @xmath39 ) . 
 we consider the nonlocal transport metric @xmath5 defined for @xmath45 by @xmath46 where the infimum runs over all sufficiently smooth curves @xmath47 \to{\mathscr{p}}(\mathcal{x})$ ] and @xmath14 \to{\mathbb{r}}^{\mathcal{x}}$ ] satisfying the _ continuity equation _ 
 @xmath48 with boundary conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 . it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath9 defines a distance on the set of probability densities @xmath51 . 
 moreover , this distance is induced by a riemannian structure on its interior @xmath52    this definition is a natural analogue of the benamou  brenier formulation of the wasserstein metric , with one crucial additional feature in the discrete setting : 
 the logarithmic mean @xmath53 is used to define , loosely speaking , the value of @xmath19 along the edge between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . 
 note that the integral representation of @xmath56 holds for all @xmath57 , while the alternative expression requires @xmath58 and @xmath59 to be strictly positive . 
 the main reason for the appearance of this particular mean is the fact that it allows one to formulate a discrete chain rule @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the discrete gradient . 
 this identity takes over the role of the usual chain rule @xmath62 that conveniently holds in the continuous setting .    in @xcite 
 , it is shown that the `` heat equation '' @xmath63 is the gradient flow equation for the relative entropy @xmath64 with respect to the riemannian structure associated with @xmath5 . in this sense 
 , the metric @xmath9 is a natural discrete analogue of the @xmath4-wasserstein distance . 
 moreover , at least in some situations @xcite , it can be shown that the metric @xmath9 converges to the @xmath4-wasserstein in the continuous limit , in the sense of gromov  hausdorff .    following the lott 
 sturm approach , @xcite gave the following definition of lower ricci curvature boundedness . 
 [ def : ricci ] we say that a markov triple @xmath43 has ricci curvature bounded from below by @xmath65 if for any constant speed geodesic @xmath66}$ ] in @xmath67 we have @xmath68    we shall use the notation @xmath69 [ or briefly @xmath70 . 
 since @xmath71 is a geodesic space , this definition is nontrivial . 
 this notion of curvature has several interesting properties , obtained in @xcite :    * a markov chain that has @xmath72 satisfies various functional inequalities , such as the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality @xmath73 with constant @xmath74 , as well as a poincar inequality @xmath75 with constant @xmath76 . here 
 , @xmath77 - \pi[\psi]^2 $ ] , and @xmath78 denotes the discrete dirichlet form given by @xmath79.\ ] ] these functional inequalities imply the exponential convergence estimates @xmath80 along the heat equation @xmath63 . * 
 ricci curvature bounds tensorize : if @xmath81 , then the product chain @xmath82 defined by @xmath83 satisfies @xmath84 .    besides the entropic ricci curvature studied in this paper , 
 several other notions of discrete ricci curvature have been studied in the literature , including ollivier s coarse ricci curvature @xcite , rough ricci curvature by bonciocat and sturm @xcite and bakry  mery - type conditions , for example , @xcite . 
 we refer to @xcite to a survey covering some of these concepts 
 .      it will be useful to describe the riemannian structure associated to @xmath9 in more detail . 
 let @xmath85 be the set of edges in the graph induced by @xmath32 , and let @xmath86 be the set of discrete gradients , that is , all functions @xmath87 of the form @xmath88 for some function @xmath26 . 
 note that , at each @xmath89 , the tangent space of @xmath90 is naturally given by @xmath91 . 
 it can be proved ( see @xcite , section  3 ) that , for each @xmath92 , the mapping @xmath93 defines an bijection between @xmath86 and @xmath94 . at each @xmath89 , this map allows us to identify the tangent space with @xmath86 . 
 in other words , the continuity equation ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) provides an identification between the `` vertical tangent vector '' @xmath95 and the `` horizontal tangent vector '' @xmath96 . a riemannian structure is then defined by the @xmath19-dependent scalar product @xmath97 given by @xmath98\ ] ] for @xmath99 . 
 we shall frequently use the notation @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the norm induced by the scalar product @xmath102 . 
 the geodesic equations for this riemannian structure are given by @xmath103 where , by abuse of notation , @xmath104 denotes the partial derivative of the logarithmic mean defined in ( [ eq : log - mean ] ) , that is , for @xmath105 , @xmath106 these equations can be regarded as discrete analogues of the continuity equation and the hamilton 
 jacobi equation , respectively . 
 the hessian of the entropy can then be calculated using the expression @xmath107 where @xmath108 solves the geodesic equations with initial conditions @xmath109 and @xmath110 . 
 the following result provides an explicit formula for the hessian which resembles its continuous counterpart ( [ eq : second - derivative ] ) ; we refer to @xcite for a proof . with a slight abuse of notation , 
 we write @xmath111.\ ] ]    [ prop : b ] for any @xmath89 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 where @xmath114    since the metric structure we consider is riemannian in @xmath90 , one expects that @xmath3-geodesic convexity of @xmath115 is equivalent to @xmath116 for any function @xmath23 and any probability density @xmath89 . as 
 the riemannian structure is degenerate on the boundary of @xmath117 , this is not an immediate result , but this issue has been solved in @xcite , theorem  4.4 . 
 we thus have the following result . 
 [ prop : ric - char ] let @xmath65 . 
 a  markov triple @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 if and only if for all @xmath89 and all functions @xmath112 , we have @xmath120    in this paper , we provide a systematic method to prove such an inequality in concrete situations . 
 a very useful criterion will be given in section  [ sec : method ] . 
 let us now compare our method with the bakry  mery approach to the ( modified ) logarithmic sobolev inequality ( mlsi ) , which has been developed in the discrete setting in @xcite and @xcite . in order to prove the mlsi @xmath121 , in the bakry  mery method one considers the behaviour of the entropy @xmath122 for solutions to the heat equation @xmath123 . 
 since @xmath124 , the mlsi asserts that @xmath125 . rather than approaching this inequality directly , the idea is to investigate the second derivative of the entropy . 
 suppose that one could prove the `` convex entropy decay inequality '' @xmath126 . 
 since @xmath127 as @xmath128 , this inequality implies the mlsi after integration . 
 taking into account that @xmath129 + \pi \biggl[\frac{({\mathcal{l}}\rho_t)^2}{\rho_t } \biggr],\ ] ] the following lemma ( taken from @xcite ) summarises this discussion . 
 [ lem : bak - eme ] let @xmath130 and suppose that the convex entropy decay inequality @xmath131 + \pi \biggl[\frac{({\mathcal{l}}\rho)^2}{\rho } \biggr ] \geq { \alpha } { \mathcal{e}}(\rho , \log\rho)\ ] ] holds for all @xmath89 . 
 then the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality @xmath132 holds as well . moreover , ( [ eq : heat - flow - convexity ] ) implies the exponential convergence bound @xmath133 for all @xmath89 . 
 the last assertion follows readily from gronwall s lemma and is actually equivalent to ( [ eq : heat - flow - convexity ] ) . 
 a direct calculation shows that @xmath134 + \frac{1}2 \pi \biggl[\frac{({\mathcal{l}}\rho)^2}{\rho } \biggr],\end{aligned}\ ] ] hence , in view of proposition  [ prop : ric - char ] , the following lemma follows immediately . 
 [ lem : ric - convex decay ] let @xmath65 and suppose that @xmath135 . then the convex entropy decay inequality ( [ eq : heat - flow - convexity ] ) holds with @xmath136 . 
 the condition @xmath135 is in principle strictly stronger than the convex entropy decay inequality ( [ eq : heat - flow - convexity ] ) : we need to check that the inequality @xmath137 holds for all functions @xmath23 , and not just for @xmath138 . 
 there seems to be no reason why @xmath138 should always be the extremal case in this inequality , but we are unaware of an explicit example which demonstrates this .    in general , the constant we shall obtain here for the lower bound on ricci curvature is worse ( i.e. , smaller ) than the best known constant for the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality . 
 this was to be expected , since even in the continuous setting lower bounds on the ricci curvature have no reason to yield the optimal constant for the logarithmic sobolev inequality in general . 
 to explain and apply our method , it will be convenient to use the following point of view . given an irreducible and reversible markov triple @xmath43 , we consider a set @xmath139 of maps of @xmath140 onto itself , that represents the set of allowed moves , and a function @xmath141 , that represents the jump rates . 
 [ def : mapping ] the pair @xmath142 is called a mapping representation of @xmath21 if the following properties are satisfied :    the generator @xmath21 can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 .    for any @xmath145 
 , there exists a unique @xmath146 satisfying @xmath147 for all @xmath54 with @xmath148 .    for every @xmath149 
 , we have @xmath150 = \pi \biggl [ \sum_{\delta\in g } f \bigl(\delta \eta , \delta^{-1}\bigr ) c(\eta , \delta ) \biggr].\ ] ]    every irreducible reversible markov chain has a mapping representation . 
 it is always possible to explicitly build one , by considering the set of bijections @xmath151 that exchanges @xmath54 and @xmath152 , and leaves all other points unchanged ( see @xcite ) , but in general it is more natural to work with a different , smaller set @xmath139 , as we shall see in the examples of section  [ sec : examples ] . 
 property  3 expresses the reversibility of the markov chain .    with this notation 
 , we can rewrite the action functional @xmath153 as @xmath154.\ ] ]    as discussed in the , a key element of the optimal transport approach to curvature in the continuous setting is the bochner identity @xmath155 . 
 this identity allows one to reformulate @xmath156 the continuous analogue of @xmath157 , in the equivalent form @xmath158 since the first term in this expression is nonnegative , lower bounds on the ricci curvature immediately translate into lower bounds on @xmath159 .    in the discrete setting , as far as we know , there is no direct analogue of bochner s identity . to get around this issue ( in the context of the bakry  mery approach for functional inequalities ) 
 , it was suggested in @xcite and @xcite to introduce a function @xmath160 that satisfies some properties of spatial invariance , in such a way that a one - sided bochner inequality holds . 
 [ ass : r ] there exists a function @xmath161 such that    @xmath162 for all @xmath163 and @xmath164 ;    @xmath165 = \pi [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta)\psi(\gamma\eta , \gamma^{-1 } , \delta )   ] $ ] for all bounded functions @xmath166 ;    @xmath167 for all @xmath168 and @xmath164 with @xmath169 . 
 clearly , ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) imply that for all bounded functions @xmath23 , @xmath170 = \pi \biggl [ \sum _ { \gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \psi\bigl(\delta\eta , \gamma , \delta^{-1}\bigr ) \biggr].\ ] ] we will show that a function @xmath160 that satisfies these assumptions automatically satisfies the following identity . 
 [ lem : bochner_identity ] let @xmath171 and @xmath23 be two real - valued functions on @xmath25 , and let @xmath172 be a symmetric function . 
 then the following identity holds : @xmath173\\ & & \qquad = \frac{1}{4}\pi \biggl [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \nabla_{\gamma } \bigl[\alpha(\eta , \delta\eta ) \nabla_{\delta } \varphi ( \eta ) \bigr ] \nabla_{\delta } \nabla_{\gamma } \psi(\eta ) \biggr].\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in the case @xmath174 , the right - hand side in this equation can be thought of as a discrete analogue of @xmath175 . 
 we can therefore think of this identity as a sort of weighted discrete bochner identity . 
 this is a generalization of the identity used in @xcite , where the authors proved this identity in the case @xmath174 . in the applications 
 , we have in mind , we will use this identity with @xmath176 the logarithmic mean , that is @xmath177 .    proof of lemma  [ lem : bochner_identity ] we consider @xmath54 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 such that @xmath180 . note that , by assumption ( iii ) , @xmath181 . 
 first , we write @xmath182 \nabla_{\delta } \nabla_{\gamma } \psi(\eta ) \\ & & \qquad= \alpha(\gamma\eta , \delta\gamma\eta)\nabla_{\delta } \varphi ( \gamma \eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi(\delta\eta ) - \alpha(\gamma\eta , \delta\gamma\eta ) \nabla_{\delta } \varphi ( \gamma\eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi ( \eta ) \\ & & \qquad\quad { } - \alpha(\eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\delta } \varphi(\eta ) \nabla _ { \gamma}\psi(\delta\eta ) + \alpha(\eta , \delta\eta)\nabla _ { \delta } \varphi(\eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi(\eta).\end{aligned}\ ] ]    we will show that each of the four terms on the right - hand side of this equality , when multiplied by @xmath183 , summed over all @xmath179 and @xmath178 and averaged over @xmath39 , yields @xmath184.\ ] ]    for the fourth term , there is nothing to prove . for the third term , we have @xmath185 \\ & & \qquad= \pi 
 \biggl [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r ( \eta , \gamma , \delta ) \alpha ( \eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\delta^{-1}}\varphi ( \delta \eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi(\delta\eta ) \biggr ] \\ & & \qquad\stackrel{\scriptsize{{(\ref{eq : r - property } ) } } } { = } \pi \biggl [ \sum _ { \gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \alpha(\delta\eta , \eta ) \nabla_{\delta } \varphi(\eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi(\eta ) \biggr]\\ & & \qquad = \pi \biggl [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \alpha ( \eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\delta } \varphi(\eta ) \nabla _ { \gamma}\psi ( \eta ) \biggr].\end{aligned}\ ] ] the same argument works for the second term . finally , for the first term , we have @xmath186 \\ & & \qquad = -\pi \biggl [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \alpha(\gamma\eta , \delta\gamma\eta)\nabla _ 
 { \delta } \varphi(\gamma\eta ) \nabla_{\gamma^{-1}}\psi(\delta\gamma\eta ) \biggr ] \\ & & \qquad \stackrel{\mathrm{(a2 ) } } { = } -\pi \biggl[\sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta)\alpha(\eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\delta } \varphi ( \eta ) \nabla_{\gamma}\psi(\delta\eta ) \biggr ] \\ & & \qquad= \pi \biggl [ \sum_{\gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \alpha(\eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\delta } \varphi ( \eta ) \nabla_{\gamma } \psi(\eta ) \biggr ] , \ ] ] where the last identity is the one we proved right before for the third term . 
 this completes the proof .    following @xcite , our strategy is to decompose the local weight @xmath187 as @xmath188 for a suitable function @xmath189 . since the contribution of @xmath160 to the curvature 
 is nonnegative , we will only have to study lower bounds for a functional that depends on @xmath189 . 
 [ thmm : curv - crit ] assume that there exists a function @xmath160 satisfying assumption  [ ass : r ] , and let @xmath190 then we have @xmath191 where @xmath192 , \\ { \widetilde{\mathcal{b}}}_2(\rho , \psi ) & : = & \frac{1}{2}\pi \biggl [ \sum _ { \gamma , \delta } \gamma ( \eta , \gamma , \delta ) \bigl ( \nabla_{\delta } \psi(\eta ) \bigr)^2 \hat{\rho } _ 1 ( \eta , \delta\eta)\nabla_{\gamma } \rho(\eta ) \biggr ] , \\ { \widetilde{\mathcal{b}}}_3(\rho , \psi ) & : = & \frac{1}{4}\pi \biggl[\sum _ { \gamma , \delta } r(\eta , \gamma , \delta ) \hat{\rho}(\eta , \delta\eta ) \bigl(\nabla_{\gamma } \nabla _ { \delta } \psi(\eta)\bigr)^2 \biggr]\end{aligned}\ ] ] for all @xmath193 and all @xmath26 .    as a consequence , if @xmath194 , then the ricci curvature of the markov chain is bounded from below by @xmath3 . 
 inequality ( [ eq : b - inequality ] ) can be viewed as a discrete replacement for bochner s inequality ( [ eq : bochner ] ) : the quantity @xmath195 , which is a discrete analogue of the continuous expression @xmath196 , is estimated in terms of @xmath197 , a  nonnegative expression involving only second - order derivatives , and a number of terms involving first - order derivatives that may be seen as curvature terms .    in most of our applications 
 , we will use the trivial bound @xmath198 , so that we will only need to obtain a lower bound on the terms @xmath199 involving  @xmath189 . 
 this result can be used to recover the criterion of proposition  5.4 in @xcite . 
 indeed , under their assumptions , we can take @xmath200 and , therefore , @xmath201 . 
 the conclusions easily follow . 
 this criterion has been applied in @xcite to obtain the sharp ricci bound for the discrete hypercube , as well as nonnegativity of the ricci curvature for the discrete cycle @xmath202 for @xmath203 .

 in this section , we consider the case of birth and death processes on @xmath224 . 
 these are markov chains with generator @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are nonnegative functions on @xmath228 , such that @xmath229 . 
 the set of allowed moves is @xmath230 , where @xmath231 and @xmath232 . following the notation of the previous section , we write @xmath233 . 
 the generator can therefore be written as @xmath234 and , in accordance with our notation , we set @xmath235 and @xmath236 . 
 we assume that this markov chain is irreducible , and that there exists a probability measure @xmath39 on @xmath228 satisfying the detailed balance condition @xmath237 clearly , the latter condition is satisfied if and only if @xmath238 when applying our method to study curvature bounds for this markov chain , we obtain the following result .

 [ rem : countable ] strictly speaking , to include this example in our framework we need to assume that the transition rates @xmath243 vanish whenever @xmath244 is sufficiently large , so that the state spaces becomes finite . 
 however , it is reasonable to expect that the result below and its proof remain valid without this assumption . a rigorous inclusion of the countable

 mielke worked on a finite state space @xmath245 rather than on @xmath228 , but this does not effect the argument . 
 proof of theorem [ th4.1 ] first of all , using the reversibility condition , we can rewrite the action functional as @xmath246 \\ & = & \pi \bigl[a(n ) \bigl(\nabla_+\psi(n)\bigr)^2\hat{\rho}(n , n+1 ) \bigr].\end{aligned}\ ] ] following @xcite , we define the function @xmath247 by @xmath248 so that @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 .

 therefore , recalling that @xmath257 , we have @xmath258 \nonumber \\[-8pt ] \\[-8pt ] \nonumber & & { } + \frac{1}{2}\pi \biggl[a(n ) \biggl ( \frac{\nabla_+ b(n)}{\rho ( n+1)}- \frac{\nabla_+a(n)}{\rho(n ) } \biggr ) \bigl(\nabla_+\psi ( n ) \bigr)^2\hat { \rho}(n , n+1)^2 \biggr ] . \nonumber \ ] ] using the definition of @xmath259 , we obtain the inequality @xmath260 summing ( [ eq : equality3 ] ) and ( [ eq : tilde - b ] ) , and substituting the latter inequality , it follows from the assumption ( [ eq : assumpt_rates_bd ] ) that @xmath261 the result follows by an application of theorem  [ thmm : curv - crit ] . 
 we now consider interacting particle systems on the complete graph , whose sites are labeled @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is the number of sites . configurations of particles are given by collections of nonnegative integers @xmath264 , where @xmath265 denotes the number of particles at site @xmath266 
 . the whole configuration will be denoted by @xmath267 . 
 changes in the configuration are made by moving a particle ( if any ) from a site @xmath266 to a different site @xmath268 . 
 allowed moves are therefore given by maps of the form @xmath269 , where @xmath270 are two different sites , and @xmath271 is given by @xmath272 the set of allowed moves is @xmath273 , where @xmath274 denotes the map @xmath269 . 
 we write @xmath275 to denote the corresponding discrete gradient , and note that @xmath276 in the sense of definition  [ def : mapping ] .    in this section 
 , we consider zero - range processes on the complete graph with @xmath263 vertices . in such processes , the jump rate from site @xmath266 to site @xmath268 depends only on @xmath266 and on the number of particles present at @xmath266 . 
 the rates are thus given by a family of functions @xmath277 such that @xmath278 and @xmath279 for all @xmath280 and @xmath281 . 
 here , @xmath282 is the rate at which a particle is moved from site @xmath266 to a site @xmath268 , with @xmath268 chosen randomly , with uniform probability on @xmath283 . 
 the generator of the markov chain we just described is @xmath284 this dynamic conserves the total number of particles @xmath285 . 
 we define a probability measure @xmath286 on configurations with @xmath287 particles as @xmath288 with the usual convention that the latter product equals @xmath289 whenever @xmath290 . 
 the constant @xmath291 is a normalization constant , which is indeed finite , since there are a finite number of configurations with @xmath287 particles . 
 it can then be checked that the markov chain is reversible with respect to @xmath286 . in the sequel 
 , we shall systematically omit the subscript @xmath287 , which we consider fixed . 
 when applying our method to study the curvature of this process , we obtain the following result . 
 [ thmm : zrp ] assume that there exists @xmath292 and @xmath293 $ ] such that @xmath294 then the ricci curvature is bounded from below by @xmath295 . in particular , if @xmath296 , then we obtain a positive lower bound on the ricci curvature . 
 note that the assumption implies that the rates @xmath297 are strictly increasing . of particular interest 
 is the fact that the bound does not depend on either @xmath263 or @xmath287 . 
 simply assuming that the rates are strictly increasing is not enough to ensure ricci curvature is positive . in section  4.2 of @xcite , a simple example of a zero - range process for which @xmath298 is large 
 was shown to exhibit nonconvex decay of the entropy and , therefore , the ricci curvature of the markov kernel can not be positive . 
 so some assumption of the form @xmath299 is necessary . 
 on the other hand , we do not know if the assumption @xmath300 is optimal . assuming a uniform positive lower bound on the increase of the rates is known to be necessary to obtain a lower bound on the curvature that is independent of the system size and number of particles . 
 indeed , it was shown in @xcite that for the case of constant rates , the spectral gap is of order @xmath301 .    for independent random walks on the complete graph ( which corresponds to @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) , 
 we recover the size - independent lower bound on ricci curvature that was obtained in example  5.1 of @xcite . 
 the estimate on the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality that can be deduced from the curvature bound has a worse dependence on @xmath178 than the one obtained in @xcite [ which would correspond to a constant @xmath304 . 
 the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality for this model has also been studied in @xcite .

 the bound ( [ eq : final ] ) leads to a lower bound on the ricci curvature of @xmath388 , which is what we were seeking to prove . 
 we now consider the random transposition model , which is a random walk on the group of permutations @xmath389 with @xmath390 .

 [ th4.9 ] for @xmath390 , the ricci curvature of the random transposition model is bounded from below by @xmath404 . 
 this bound was already obtained using a different method in @xcite . 
 it should be noted that the modified logarithmic sobolev constant implied by this ricci curvature bound is significantly worse ( by a factor @xmath405 ) than its known optimal behaviour .

 it follows directly from this lemma that for every @xmath424 and @xmath425 , @xmath426 the following inequality plays a crucial role in the proof of the curvature bound for the bernoulli  laplace model and for zero - range processes .

 using the fact that @xmath56 is @xmath289-homogeneous , and @xmath433 and @xmath434 are @xmath435-homogeneous , the inequality we wish to prove is equivalent to @xmath436 since @xmath56 is concave , we have @xmath437 using the `` curve below tangent '' formulation of concavity applied to the function @xmath438 , we have @xmath439 and ( [ eq : lem_concavity_zrp ] ) immediately follows , which completes the proof .

14,"the _ international technology roadmap for semiconductors _ indicates the need to decrease the sio@xmath4 gate thickness to less than 3 nm to pursue the continuity of the moore s law @xcite . 
 research efforts to maintain this trend have been focusing on : ( _ i _ ) the advantageous substitution of sio@xmath4 by high dielectric constant materials to allow equivalent gate dielectric oxide thickness bellow 1 nm @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) a better understanding of the fractal regime of ultra - thin gate dielectric oxide growth , where spatial inhomogeneities or fluctuations are important @xcite considerations for the control of dielectric breakdown conditions . 
 consequently , the reliability of ultra - thin oxides for ultra - large scale integration is one of the most important concerns in the domain of electronics miniaturization nowadays @xcite . 
 two quantities which are experimentally measured to assess the reliability of a metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) device are : the charge - to - breakdown @xmath5 , defined as the time - integrated current density which flows until breakdown occurs , and the time - to - breakdown @xmath3 , defined as the samples lifetime . 
 these quantities are statistically distributed and are usually assumed to be weibull distributed @xcite 
 . in particular , accurate assessment of reliability of ultra - thin oxides is seriously affected by fluctuations of oxide thickness . 
 these fluctuations cause a deviation from the weibull distribution , which is easily observed by a curvature in a graph of @xmath6 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] , being@xmath8 the cumulative distribution . 
 extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles to lower failure percentiles can lead to serious errors in reliability assessment , as shown by wu _ 
 _ @xcite . 
 deviations from a given distribution can be generated by taking scale mixtures of it @xcite . 
 for instance , the scale parameter of the exponential and gaussian distributions can be averaged by a gamma distribution . in these two cases , 
 the deviation induced by the fluctuation in this parameter has been successfully employed in the description of physical situations , such as those related with nonexponential decay @xcite and turbulence @xcite . 
 furthermore , this average process has also been connected with the entropic parameter @xmath2 in the context of tsallis statistics @xcite . by taking the fluctuations of the modal parameter of the weibull distribution into account , 
 we obtain a generalized weibull distribution which properly describes @xmath3 data when oxide fluctuations are present , thus improving reliability assessment of ultra - thin oxides by @xmath3 extrapolation and area scaling . 
 this generalized weibull distribution , without focusing fluctuations , was discussed and applied in ref . 
 @xcite to other systems .    in the following section we present the generalized weibull distribution employed here . 
 the application of this distribution to the description of the dielectric breakdown in oxides is considered in section 3 .

 the weibull distribution often used in the statistical description in the study of the time - to - breakdown in electronic devices @xcite is given by @xmath14,\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath15 is the modal value that corresponds to @xmath16 of the samples lifetime . 
 the parameter @xmath17 is the weibull slope and defines the time - to - breakdown spreading degree . in order to incorporate the referred fluctuation 
 , we consider a weibull compound distribution @xmath18 . here , 
 @xmath19 , with @xmath17 fixed and @xmath15 changing so that the new parameter @xmath20 is a stochastic variable ruled by the gamma probability density function    @xmath21    therefore , the average in the stochastic parameter @xmath20 , @xmath22 leads to @xcite @xmath23    note that by naming this average @xmath24 , it can be written as @xmath25,\ ] ] where we used the @xmath2-exponential function defined as @xmath26^{1/(1-q')}$ ] if @xmath27 , and @xmath28 if @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] .    by comparing eq.([weibull ] ) with eq.([q - w ] ) we verify that @xmath24 is a generalization of the weibull distribution in the same sense that the @xmath2-exponential function generalizes the exponential one . 
 in view of this observation and following ref . 
 @xcite , we refer to @xmath24 as @xmath2-weibull distribution . 
 we also remark that @xmath24 contains a broad class of distributions as particular cases . 
 in fact , in the limit @xmath32 it reduces to the weibull distribution , for @xmath33 it gives the @xmath2-exponential distribution , and when @xmath32 and @xmath33 it becomes the exponential distribution . 
 furthermore , from eq.([qw ] ) we verify two power law regimes , one for small @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and another for large @xmath34 , @xmath36 . 
 notice also that @xmath37 exists and is equal to one when @xmath38 .    before addressing our discussion to the application of the @xmath2-weibull distribution concerning experimental and simulation results 
 , we give a connection of this distribution with the tsallis statistics . the first step towards verifying this connection 
 is based on the fact that the @xmath2-exponential can be viewed as a signature of the tsallis statistics , since it basically replaces the exponential in the canonical distribution . 
 in fact , this canonical distribution is obtained when the tsallis entropy @xmath39 is maximized subjected to appropriate constraints @xcite . here , @xmath40 is the probability of the @xmath41th state , @xmath42 is the number of accessible states , and @xmath2 is a real parameter that rules the degree of generalization of the theory ( when @xmath43 we recover the usual entropy ) . on the other hand , the @xmath2-exponential function can be obtained from the average of the exponential function by using the gamma distribution , eq . ( [ beta ] ) 
 thus , the parameter @xmath2 occurring in the tsallis statistics is shown to be entirely induced by the fluctuations of the parameter of the usual exponential distribution @xcite . following this interpretation , 
 the average process employed to obtain @xmath24 characterizes an implicit connection with the tsallis statistics . 
 to apply our distribution , eq . 
 ( [ q - w ] ) , to investigate experimental and numerical simulated data , we consider the cumulative distribution for @xmath24 , _ 
 i.e. _ , @xmath44,\ ] ] with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in connection with the @xmath2-exponential function , the @xmath2-logarithm function 
 is usually defined as @xcite @xmath47 thus @xmath48=\exp_q[\ln_q(x)]=x$ ] . by using eq . 
 ( [ q - rank ] ) , we obtain that the graph of @xmath49 $ ] versus @xmath9 gives a straight line since @xmath50\,=\beta\,ln(t)\,-\,\beta\ln(\alpha).\ ] ] therefore , if a cumulative distribution relative to the dielectric breakdown for a given set of data , @xmath51 , is well described by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , then the @xmath2 parameter present in the @xmath2-logarithm is obtained through a linear adjustment , and the parameter @xmath17 is the slope of the graph . this procedure introduced here 
 will be referred as a @xmath2-weibull plot .    to compare the usefulness of the weibull and the @xmath2-weibull distributions , we analyze experimental @xcite and simulation results . 
 figure [ fig1](a ) , which is adapted from the work of wu et _ al . _ 
 @xcite , shows a curvature in a graph @xmath52 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] . 
 the variation of this slope is associated with oxide thickness fluctuations . 
 in fact , wu _ et al . 
 _ @xcite were able to generate this slope variation by performing simulations in which the oxide thickness obeyed a gaussian distribution . 
 extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles ( conventional experimental window ) to lower failure percentiles leads to an error in @xmath3 projection and , consequently , in projection of reliability . 
 it is necessary to use large and time - consuming sample sizes ( thousands of devices ) in order to obtain @xmath3 distributions down to lower percentiles and avoid erroneous projections . 
 the same @xmath3 data can be correctly fitted in the entire range of percentiles by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , as shown in fig . [ 
 fig1](b ) . in the @xmath2-weibull plot 
 , the data follow a straight line . 
 we conclude that , by taking the fluctuations of the modal parameter of the weibull distribution into account , one obtains a statistical distribution which completely describes @xmath3 data when oxide fluctuations are present . 
 therefore , the @xmath2-weibull distribution allows improved @xmath3 projection for ultra - thin oxides and does not require a very large number of samples , _ 
 i.e. _ , correct @xmath3 extrapolation can be performed in the conventional experimental window . 
 this is a striking benefit brought by the @xmath2-weibull distribution . 
 in addition to correct @xmath3 projection , we have found that the @xmath2-weibull also improves area scaling , another important consideration for reliability studies @xcite . in fig . 
 [ fig2](a ) , we have used the data from the work of teramoto _ et al . _ @xcite . 
 they studied the time - dependent dielectric breakdown for @xmath10 thin sio@xmath4 oxides with samples areas of @xmath12 and @xmath53 , and subjected to a @xmath54 applied field . 
 it is clear , when comparing fig . 
 [ fig2](a ) and fig . 
 [ fig2](b ) , that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better area scaling than the weibull one , another remarkable benefit . 
 when @xmath3 data are plotted in a limited range of percentiles , the differences between the @xmath2-weibull and the weibull distributions become less apparent , but can still be seen . as an example , we consider the simulations performed by sombra _ 
 they developed a percolation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a mos capacitor investigating effects of bias polarity , oxide film thickness and electric field strength . 
 the hot electron injection is either through the gate or the substrate . in fig . 
 [ fig3](a ) we have performed a linear fit of the simulation data of sombra @xcite with the weibull distribution , while in fig . 
 [ fig3](b ) we depict the same data but with a linear fit through the @xmath2-weibull distribution . 
 one can see once more that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better fit than the weibull one , for small and large @xmath3 . 
 in summary , we conclude that : ( _ i _ ) fluctuation on the modal value is a mechanism to explain deviations from the weibull distribution in reliability studies of electronics devices ; ( _ ii _ ) this fluctuation leads to a generalization of the weibull distribution ( @xmath2-weibull distribution ) and a connection with the tsallis statistics ; and ( _ iii _ ) the generalized weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment of experimental and simulated data in comparison with the weibull one , giving improved @xmath3 extrapolation and area scaling . 
 finally , the results presented here can be very useful for an improved description of the dielectric breakdown in the high dielectric constant materials @xcite which will be present in future generations of advanced mos devices .

15,"in recent years the dynamics of dissociative adsorption and associative desorption of hydrogen has been studied in great detail , experimentally as well as theoretically ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite and @xcite ) . 
 one of the key motivation for these investigations is that by studying this simple surface reaction one hopes to learn about the crucial principles underlying more complex surface reactions which occur , e.g. , in heterogenous catalysis . in the following 
 i will focus on quantum dynamical investigations aimed at the understanding of dissociation . for a much more detailed discussion 
 see the recent excellent review by darling and holloway @xcite . 
 chemical reactions at surfaces represent the interaction of a system with a limited number of degrees of freedom ( the molecule ) with the half - infinite solid which posesses in principle an infinite number of degrees of freedom . 
 however , for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen , especially on metal surfaces , there is little energy transfer to the substrate phonons due to the large mass mismatch . 
 the crucial process in the understanding of the dissociation is the conversion of the kinetic and internal energy of the molecule into translational energy of the atoms relative to each other , the subsequent energy dissipation to the solid is not relevant for the dissociation . in addition , 
 electronic levels of hydrogen molecules in front of metal surfaces are broadened significantly @xcite so that electronic excitations are very effectively quenched . 
 this situation seems to be different for hydrogen adsorption on semi - conductor surfaces , especially in the well studied system h@xmath0/si . 
 it had been proposed @xcite that the experimental puzzle of low sticking coefficient and almost thermal distribution in desorption - the former result indicating a high barrier to adsorption , the latter a low barrier ( see @xcite and references therein ) - can be reconciled if lattice distortions on adsorption are taken into account . the strong rearrangement of the silicon surface due to hydrogen adsorption has been confirmed in total - energy calculations @xcite , and also the predicted strong surface temperature dependence of the sticking probability of h@xmath0/si @xcite has been found experimentally @xcite . 
 the dynamics of dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the more densely packed metal surfaces , however , can be described using low - dimensional potential energy surfaces ( pes ) because of the large mass mismatch , the smaller space for surface rearrangements , and the quenched electronic excitations @xcite . in principle 
 the pes should be six - dimensional describing all the degrees of freedom of the hydrogen molecule . however , up to recently there had been no six - dimensional quantum dynamical investigations of the adsorption and desorption dynamics because the calculations were computationally too demanding . hence the quantum dynamicists were restricted to low - dimensional model calculations . since the crucial coordinate for the dissociation process is the intramolecular spacing , a large number of studies were devoted to the dynamics on two - dimensional so - called `` elbow '' potentials where 
 the h@xmath0 center of mass distance from the surface and the h - h distance were considered @xcite . 
 these studies provided us with a qualitative understanding of the topological features that realistic potentials should have in these two coordinates in order to describe surface reactions . 
 further quantum mechanical model studies coupled the two - dimensional elbow potential to one surface oscillator in order to account for recoil and surface temperature effects @xcite . 
 just recently there has been a large number of papers dealing with the effects of rotations on the sticking probability , especially with steric effects and the non - monotonous dependence of the sticking probability on rotational quantum number  @xmath1 in the system h@xmath0/cu(111 ) @xcite . 
 although already in the earliest studies on dissociative adsorption @xcite the important role of surface corrugation was stressed , except for in the studies of nrskov and co - workers @xcite and holloway and co - worders @xcite , little attention has been paid to the influence of corrugation on the adsorption dynamics . 
 there are two main reasons for this . 
 firstly a large number of adsorption systems show the so - called normal - energy scaling @xcite , i.e. , the sticking probability is a function of the normal component of the kinetic energy of the impinging molecules alone . 
 this scaling behaviour is usually associated with a flat , structureless surface . and 
 secondly , the magnitude of the corrugation had to be more or less guessed since the mapping out of the whole pes by _ ab initio _ methods was much too time - consuming . since also 
 the electronic density in front of metal surfaces is rather smeared out @xcite , the picture of low - corrugated metal surfaces was widely accepted .    due to the improvement of computer power and the development of efficient algorithms it just recently has become possible to map out the six - dimensional pes of hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces @xcite by reliable density - functional calculations . 
 it came as a surprise when elaborate studies of the h@xmath0/cu system @xcite revealed that the pes is strongly corrugated although this system obeyed normal energy scaling in the beam experiments @xcite . 
 these theoretical findings renewed the interest of the role of corrugation for the dissociation dynamics @xcite . in a three - dimensional model study darling and holloway @xcite showed how the apparent contradiction between normal energy scaling and strongly corrugated pes can be reconciled if the pes exhibits topological features now termed `` balanced corrugation '' @xcite . 
 the availability of high - dimensional potential energy surfaces has caused new efforts for the improvement of the quantum dynamical algorithms . 
 while up to recently it was believed that the inclusion of all molecular degrees of freedom in a quantum dynamical calculation is too computationally expensive @xcite , there is now the first six - dimensional quantum study of the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption @xcite . 
 high - dimensional quantum dynamical studies using _ ab initio _ potentials serve a twofold purpose . 
 firstly they can yield a quantitative as well as also a novel qualitative understanding of the dissociation process because all relevant degrees of freedom are included . 
 but secondly also the reliabiblity of the total - energy calculations can be checked . 
 the results for the h@xmath0/cu system showed that one has to go beyond the local - density approximation ( lda ) in the treatment of exchange - correlation effects in order to obtain realistic barrier heights @xcite . 
 but still the non - local corrections are approximative and their validity is highly debated , especially in the h@xmath0/si(100 ) system @xcite . 
 since from just looking at a pes one can not extract whether the pes is accurate , one has to perform dynamical calculations _ on _ this pes in order to find out .    in the following 
 i will present two examples of high - dimensional quantum dynamical studies on _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces . 
 the first example deals with the h@xmath0/cu(111 ) system @xcite where dissociation is hindered by noticable barriers . 
 i will focus on the effect of lateral surface corrugation on the sticking probability in the tunneling and the classical regime and on the role of additional parallel momentum . 
 the second example is then devoted to h@xmath0/pd(100 ) @xcite , a system where activated as well as non - activated paths to dissociative adsorption exist . 
 it will be shown that the initial decrease of the sticking probability with kinetic energy found in this system @xcite is not due to a precursor mechanism , as was commonly believed , but can be explained by dynamical steering . in addition , rotational effects will be discussed . 
 the paper ends with some concluding remarks . 
 h@xmath0/cu has been the benchmark system for the study of dissociative adsorption . 
 an abundance of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations about this system exists , just to mention a few . 
 the calculated barrier heights varied substantially over the years ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) and the discussion still goes on @xcite . for the h@xmath0/cu(111 ) it was found that the barrier to dissociative adsorption for the molecular axis parallel to the surface varied between 0.73 and 1.43  ev within the surface unit cell for a four - layer substrate in the slab calculations . 
 convergence tests suggested that the minimum barrier should be lowered to 0.5  ev . 
 a five - dimensional parametrisation of the _ ab initio _ pes has served as an input for a dynamical study of the adsorption and desorption @xcite , were the consistent four - layer results have been used . 
 further convergence tests which were finished after the completion of the dynamical calculations showed that the whole barrier region of the pes should be shifted by approximately the same amount as the minimum barrier @xcite . in the dynamical study 
 the three center - of - mass coordinates and the interatomic spacing of the h@xmath0 molecule have been treated quantum mechanically , while the azimuthal orientation of the molecule has been taken into account in a classical sudden approximation which works quite well in the h@xmath0/cu system @xcite . 
 the polar orientation is not varied which means that the molecular axis is kept parallel to the surface . 
 the quantum dynamics were determined in a time - independent coupled - channel scheme using the concept of the _ local reflection matrix _ @xcite and the _ inverse local transmission matrix _ @xcite . 
 this very stable method also yields the wave function of the scattering problem @xcite . 
 it is closely related to the logarithmic derivative of the solution matrix and thus avoids exponentially increasing evanescent waves which cause numerical instabilities . 
 ( 10,6 )    ( 10,6 )    the results of the quantum dynamical calculations of the sticking probability of h@xmath0/cu(111 ) for molecules initially in the vibrational ground state under normal and non - normal incidence are shown in fig . 
 [ stickh2cu ] versus the normal kinetic energy in a linear and in a logarithmic plot . for comparison also 
 the results of two - dimensional calculations with the minimum barrier are shown . 
 i will first focus on the normal - incidence data in the low - energy regime ( fig . 
 [ stickh2cu](b ) ) where sticking is impossible classically . comparing the 2d and the 5d results shows that the effect of corrugation in the tunneling regime is an almost energy - independent suppression of the sticking probability , in this case by about two orders of magnitude . 
 since the increase of the sticking probability in 2d calculations is determined by the barrier width @xcite , this indicates that at energies below the minimum barrier height the adsorption dynamics are governed by the minimum barrier path . this result 
 is also confirmed by wave function plots @xcite . 
 it can be simply understood by the fact that the transmission through a barrier in the tunneling regime is exponentially suppressed which on the other hand leads to an exponential preference of the minimum barrier path compared to all other paths .    in the energy regime where sticking classically is possible ( which will be referred to as the `` classical regime '' in the following ) the sticking curves of the 2d and the 5d calculations are no longer parallel ( fig . 
 [ stickh2cu](a ) ) . 
 indeed the sticking probability in the 5d calculations starts rising in the linear plot at an energy corresponding to the minimum barrier height and reaches unity at an energy which corresponds to the maximum barrier height ( the onset of the sticking in the linear plot occurs already at approximately 0.15  ev below the minimum barrier height due to the softening of the h@xmath0  bond at the surface and the accompanying reduction of the zero - point vibrational energy ) . 
 obviously the whole distribution of the barrier heights determines the sticking probability . at these high kinetic energies ( larger than 0.6  ev ) the dynamics in the classical regime 
 can be described in the sudden limit . a molecule impinging on the surface sticks or not according to whether its energy is larger than the barrier it hits or not , there are little reorientation and steering effects . 
 this means that the sticking in this energy regime can be understood in terms of the available phase space for dissociation which is the basic assumption underlying the so - called hole - model @xcite .    in the first presentation @xcite the theoretical results 
 were compared to data compiled by michelsen and auerbach @xcite . 
 they fitted existing adsorption data and , via the principle of detailed balance , also desorption data to a functional form of the sticking probability of the form @xmath2.\ ] ] these experimental data were at variance with the theoretical data of ref . 
 @xcite especially at low and at high energies . in the meantime 
 a new , very detailed experimental study of the adsorption and desorption of h@xmath0/cu(111 ) has been published by rettner _ 
 _ @xcite . to describe the sticking function they used @xmath3,\ ] ] because this functional form reproduces the adsorption data better at low energies @xcite . and indeed , while in the old parametrisation the experimental sticking probability did not drop below 10@xmath4 @xcite , now at low energies in fig . 
 [ stickh2cu](b ) the experimental and the theoretical curve no longer disagree substantially . 
 the two curves are almost parallel , whereby the shift of approximately 0.25  ev can be related to the minimum barrier height in the calculations which seems to be to too high by the same amount @xcite . 
 this indicates that , except for the barrier height , the minimum barrier path is properly described by the _ ab initio _ pes . 
 the same shift of 0.25  ev between theory and experiment is also seen at the onset of sticking in the linear plot , fig . 
 [ stickh2cu](a ) ( note the different energy scale in the linear and the logarithmic plot ) . however , while the experimental curve saturates at a sticking probability of 0.25 , the theoretical curve reaches almost one . 
 the issue of the maximum sticking probability for h@xmath0/cu(111 ) is still strongly debated . 
 @xcite state that their experimental sticking probabilities could equally well fitted with a values between 0.15 and 0.5 since the measurements do not extend to energies above 0.55  ev . 
 just one fitting parameter @xmath5 for the width of the sticking curve may not be sufficient , since the increase of the sticking probability is determined by two different properties : in the tunneling regime by the barrier width , and in the classical regime by the distribution of the barrier heights . on the other hand the polar rotation of the molecule had not been considered for the theoretical results in fig . 
 [ stickh2cu ] . 
 particles that hit the surface in the upright orientation can not dissociate . 
 so the inclusion of the polar orientation will probabably reduce the maximum sticking probability since at high energies molecules will not have enough time to reorientate towards a more favorable configuration towards dissociative adsorption during the scattering process .    with regard to the effect of additional parallel momentum , fig . 
 [ stickh2cu]a ) shows that for non - normal incidence the sticking probabilities fall upon the normal incidence sticking curve if they are plotted versus the normal kinetic energy , at least in the classical regime . 
 this normal - energy scaling is surprising considering the strong corrugation of the surface which is shown in fig . 
 [ h2cuwfpes ] . 
 darling and holloway @xcite have first addressed this issue . 
 they showed that the variation of the barrier height ( energetic corrugation ) and the variation of the barrier position ( geometric corrugation ) have opposing effects as far as the role of additional parallel momentum is concerned . the plot of the wave function @xcite scattered at the corrugated pes in fig . 
 [ h2cuwfpes ] illustrates these effects . in order to make both the incoming and the reflected part of the beam visible in one single plot , the lateral extension of the beam perpendicular to its propagation direction , which is in principle infinite , 
 is restricted . 
 thus by following the wave fronts the propagation of the beam and its splitting in a reflected and transmitted part can be followed . 
 due to the energetic corrugation molecules with additional parallel momentum will sample a range of energy barriers which leads to a averaging process over the barriers . 
 if their normal kinetic energy is less than the mean barrier height then this averaging process leads to a suppression of the sticking probability @xcite . 
 [ h2cuwfpes ] shows that molecules which encounter the high - barrier sites are scattered back into the gas phase . 
 ( 10,6 )    on the other hand the area in the surface unit cell where the propagation direction of the incoming beam is aligned to the local gradient of the potential becomes actually larger for additional parallel momentum due to the geometric corrugation . 
 this results in an enhancement of the sticking probability @xcite . now if the maximum barriers are at a greater distance from the surface , the opposing effects of energetic and geometric corrugation can balance @xcite leading to normal - energy scaling in spite of the strong corrugation . 
 the question now arises whether this is just a coincidence that nature has hidden the fact of the strongly corrugated surfaces by these peculiar balancing features of the pes . however , total energy calculations show that usually the larger barriers to dissociative adsorption are in front of on - top positions @xcite . and there the interaction between molecule and surface occurs further away from the surface as compared to , e.g. , bridge and hollow sites @xcite since in front of the atoms the electron density spills further out into the vacuum . 
 so the topological features responsible for the normal - energy scaling do not seem too peculiar regarding the underlying principles of the chemical interaction . 
 figure  [ stickh2cu](b ) also reveals that in the tunneling regime additional parallel momentum enhances sticking . 
 this is due to the fact that in the realm of tunneling dynamics parallel momentum is effectively converted into normal momentum for energetic as well as for geometric corrugation @xcite . 
 the observation that in beam experiments normal energy scaling is found for all energies in the system h@xmath0/cu(111 ) @xcite can be explained by the fact that a low kinetic energies sticking in the beam experiments is dominated by the vibrationally excited molecules , and for these molecules the range where normal - energy scaling is obeyed is shifted to lower energies @xcite . 
 molecular beam experiments of the dissociative adsorption of h@xmath0 on various transition metal surfaces like pd(100 ) @xcite , pd(111 ) and pd(110 ) @xcite , w(111 ) @xcite , w(100 ) @xcite , w(100)-c(2@xmath62)cu @xcite and pt(100 ) @xcite show that the sticking probability initially decreases with increasing kinetic energy of the beam in these systems . 
 such a behaviour is usually attributed to a precursor mechanism : before dissociation the molecules are temporarily trapped in a molecular adsorption state , the so - called precursor state , where they accomodate to the surface temperature . in order to be trapped , the molecules have to lose their initial kinetic energy which is assumed to happen primarily by energy transfer to the substrate phonons @xcite . and 
 it is this trapping probability which decreases with increasing energy and thus determines the sticking probability for dissociative adsorption . at higher energies the sticking probability rises again in all systems mentioned above indicating that the adsorption via direct activated paths becomes dominant . 
 however , for hydrogen adsorption the large mass mismatch between adsorbate and substrate should make the energy transfer process inefficient . together with the missing surface temperature dependence this led to a dynamical steering process being proposed in order to explain the initial decrease of the sticking probability @xcite , but there had been no theoretical confirmation whether this mechanism could be effective . 
 recent density - functional theory calculations show that there exist non - activated as well as activated paths to dissociative adsorption in the system h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , but no molecular adsorption well @xcite . and three - dimensional quantum dynamical calculations using a model pes with such features suggested that a steering mechanism can indeed be responsible for the initial decrease of the sticking probability @xcite , but large quantitative discrepancies to the experiment remained . 
 ( 10,6.0 )    using a parametrization of the _ ab initio _ pes of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) dynamical calculations of the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption have been performed where for the first time _ all _ six degrees of freedom of the hydrogen molecule have been treated quantum dynamically @xcite . 
 figure  [ h2pdstick ] shows a comparison between experiment @xcite and the 6d calculations . 
 the dashed curve which corresponds to molecules initially in the rotational ground state exhibits a strong oscillatory structure which is at variance with the experimental data . performing three - dimensional model calculations on a pes with similiar features as the _ ab initio _ pes of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) 
 it has been shown that the quantum nature of the hydrogen beam leads to an oscillatory structure in the sticking probability@xcite . whenever the kinetic energy becomes large enough to open up new scattering channels , 
 the reflection rate has a maximum . 
 since the reflection rate and the sticking probability are related by unitarity , this means that at these energies the sticking probability shows a minimum . 
 strong oscillations in the sticking probability were also found in three - dimensional wave - packet calculations @xcite where the pes included a precursor well . 
 they were attributed to the existence of resonance states in the attractive well which , however , does not exist in the _ ab inito _ potential of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) @xcite .    in order to compare the results of the 6d calculations with the beam experiment data 
 one has take into account that the experimental beam does not correspond to a single quantum state . 
 firstly , excited rotational states are populated according to a boltzmann distribution with a temperature of 0.8 of the nozzle temperature in the case of hydrogen beams @xcite . and 
 secondly , the beam is not strictly monoenergetic , but has a certain energy spread of typically @xmath7 @xcite ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the initial kinetic energy and velocity , respectively ) . if the theoretical results are averaged over initial states according to the experimental conditions ( solid line in fig . 
 [ h2pdstick ] ) , the strong oscillations disappear . 
 the resulting theoretical curve agrees quite satisfactory with experiment . 
 although no precursor state exists in the pes and the energy transfer to substrate phonons is not taken into account due to the fixed substrate atoms , the initial decrease of the sticking probability with increasing kinetic energy is well reproduced . 
 since the precursor mechanism can not be responsible , only a dynamical steering effect can cause the initial decrease . 
 this steering effect is confirmed in the coupled - channel calculations by the fact that at low energies more channels are needed in order to get converged results than at high energies . 
 usually it is the other way around since at higher energies more channels are energetically accessible . 
 this unusual behavior indicates that at low energies there is a strong dynamical redistribution among the different channels while at high energies the dynamics is closer to the adibatic limit with little transitions between the channels . 
 ( 10,6.0 )    the classical analogue to the quantum dynamical description of the steering effect is illustrated in fig . 
 [ h2pdtraj ] which shows a two - dimensional cut through the six - dimensional pes together with two typical trajectories of impinging h@xmath0 molecules . by symmetry , 
 both trajectories have equivalent impact parameters , but while the slower molecule ( left trajectory ) can be steered towards a non - activated path to adsorption by the attractive forces , the other molecule ( right trajectory ) is too fast for the forces to divert it significantly . 
 it hits the repulsive part of the potential and is reflected back into the gas phase . by further increasing the kinetic energy 
 the molecule will eventually have enough energy to directly cross the barrier which leads to the increase of the sticking probability at higher energies ( see fig . 
 [ h2pdstick ] ) . 
 ( 10,6.0 )    the steering effect should also be observed in desorption properties , e.g. , the mean kinetic energy in desorption . in ref . 
 @xcite three - dimensional dynamical calculations on a model potential with non - activated as well as activated paths to dissociative adsorption have been performed where the pes looked quite similiar to fig . 
 [ h2pdtraj ] . in order 
 to desorb the molecules have to have enough kinetic energy normal to the surface to overcome the barrier for desorption . 
 this corresponds to trajectories starting from below in fig . 
 [ h2pdtraj ] . 
 now most desorbing molecules propagate along minimum barrier paths @xcite . except for the molecules following the high - symmetry path 
 there are forces acting on the molecules which will divert them from the normal desorption direction . and 
 again , the slower the molecules are , the more they will be diverted . 
 this also means that at high desorption angles primarily low - energy molecules will be found . 
 indeed the 3d model calculations follow this trend ( see fig .  [ wkinpd ] ) @xcite . 
 while for normal desorption the mean kinetic energy is in equilibrium with the surface temperature ( note that in two dimensions the flux - corrected mean kinetic energy of a gas in equilibrium is 3/2 kt ) , for high desorption angles the mean kinetic energy is strongly lowered . 
 this means that a peaked mean kinetic energy in desorption is not always indicative of non - thermal processes @xcite . 
 in addition , it shows that one - dimensional models @xcite are not sufficient in order to describe angular distributions in desorption . 
 a dynamical degree of freedom that has not been considered so far in this brief review is the rotational degree of freedom . as for the influence of additional rotational motion on the sticking probability 
 , there are two different mechanisms operative . 
 just recently it has been pointed out @xcite that , apart from the change in moment of inertia , an isomorphism exists between surface corrugation and a planar rotor which means that there is a close correspondence in the way the lateral surface corrugation and the orientational anisotropy of the molecule - surface potential enter into the dynamics . 
 the barrier to dissociative adsorption strongly depends on the molecular orientation @xcite . 
 thus additional rotational motion acts like additional parallel momentum in the case of energetic corrugation . due to the range of barrier heights which is probed by the rotating molecule the sticking probability 
 is effectively suppressed @xcite . however , in the case of the h@xmath0/cu system due to the late barrier to adsorption the molecular bond is strongly extended when the barrier region is crossed . 
 the resulting increase in the moment of inertia causes a decrease of the rotational energy . 
 this leads to a lowering of the effective barrier with increasing rotational quantum number @xmath1 and to an enhancement in the sticking probability for high @xmath1  values @xcite in agreement with the experiment @xcite . 
 ( 10,6.0 )    now in the system h@xmath0/pd(100 ) there are non - activated paths to dissociative adsorption so that the concept of early and late barriers is not applicable . 
 indeed fig . 
 [ h2pdstick ] shows that by taking into account the rotational population of the incoming beam in adsorption , the averaged sticking probability is slightly decreased as compared to molecules in the rotational ground state @xcite at all kinetic energies . especially at low energies additional rotational motion 
 strongly reduces the sticking probability . 
 this is shown in fig . 
 [ steric ] for a initial kinetic energy of @xmath10  mev . 
 the diamonds correspond to the orientationally averaged sticking probability @xmath11 the strong decrease is caused by a suppression of the steering effect . 
 the faster a molecule is rotating , the harder the molecular axis can be focused to a favorable orientation towards adsorption , and the more molecules will be reflected at the surface . 
 in addition , fig . 
 [ steric ] shows the effect of molecular orientation on the sticking probability . 
 the most favorable orientation to adsorption is with the molecular axis parallel to the surface . 
 molecules with azimuthal quantum number  @xmath12 have their axis preferentially oriented parallel to the surface . these molecules rotating in the so - called helicopter fashion 
 dissociate more easily than molecules rotating in the cartwheel fashion ( @xmath13 ) with their rotational axis preferentially parallel to the surface since the latter have a high probability hitting the surface in an upright orientation in which they can not dissociate . 
 this steric effect has also been investigated in a number of model studies for purely activated adsorption @xcite .    invoking the principle of detailed balance , from the suppresion of the sticking probability by rotation 
 it follows that the population of rotational states in desorption should be lower than expected for molecules in thermal equilibrium with the surface temperature . 
 this so - called rotational cooling has indeed been found for h@xmath0 molecules desorbing from pd(100 ) @xcite and is also well reproduced by the six - dimensional quantum dynamical calculations @xcite . 
 in this brief review two recent examples of high - dimensional quantum dynamical studies using _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces have been presented . for the interaction of light diatomic molecules interacting with metal surfaces the continous excitation spectrum of the solid can be often neglected . for these systems 
 now an almost complete understanding of the dissociation process can be gained since translational , vibrational , rotational and lateral effects no longer have to be treated separately . 
 our current understanding of simple surface reactions is mostly based on low - dimensional dynamical studies on model potentials . 
 these studies provided us with a great deal of insight into the crucial principles underlying these simple surface reactions . 
 however , high - dimensional studies do not only enhance the quantitative agreement with experiment . 
 due to the microscopic information also a new qualitative understanding of dissociation and scattering at surfaces can be obtained . 
 since this development has just started , many interesting results should be anticipated in the near future .

16,"a large body of work has already been devoted to the cgl equation , which reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex field .    in the context of amplitude equations  @xcite , which are large - scale descriptions of physical systems passed ( and near ) symmetry - breaking instability thresholds , 
 the cgl equation has been recognized as the relevant equation for the slow modulations of oscillations in a continuous medium near a hopf bifurcation  @xcite . 
 more generally , it appears in the description of spatially - extended systems when oscillations or waves are present .        under the form ( [ cgl ] ) , 
 the cgl equation has been reduced ( without loss of generality ) to its simplest from , with only two real parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . 
 the first term of the rhs is related to the linear instability mechanism which led to oscillations . 
 the second term accounts for diffusion and dispersion , while the cubic nonlinear term insures if @xmath4 , otherwise other terms may be necessary the saturation of the linear instability and is involved in the renormalisation of the oscillation frequency . 
 two important limits are worth mentioning : when @xmath5 , one has the real ginzburg - landau equation , which possesses a lyapunov functional and thus exhibits only relaxational dynamics  @xcite . 
 when @xmath6 dispersion plays the essential role , as one recovers the nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite . in the general case , sustained spatio - temporally disordered regimes are observed in large regions of the parameter plane ( fig .  1 ) . 
 the genericity of the cgl equation , associated to its relative simplicity , has made it one of the favorite playgrounds for testing ideas about spatiotemporal chaos in a rather realistic context  @xcite . 
 it is only recently , though , that a comprehensive study has been undertaken , as it was realized that away from the intricacy of the bifurcation diagrams at small sizes , there exists a crossover size beyond which chaos becomes extensive and can be characterized by intensive quantities independent of system size , boundary conditions , and , to a large extent , initial conditions  @xcite . indeed , 
 when chaos is extensive , statistical approaches are legitimate and should provide rather simple descriptions . in this context , 
 bifurcation diagrams typically used for small dynamical systems are replaced by `` phase diagrams '' delimiting the regions of different statistical signatures in parameter space .    whereas the one - dimensional case is now rather well known  @xcite , the situation in two dimensions is much less satisfactory , mainly because previous work was devoted to punctual problems rather than to acquiring a global picture of the properties of the equation . 
 here , thanks to current computer power , we provide a comprehensive overview of the two - dimensional cgl equation in the large - size limit  @xcite . 
 we now introduce a few important features of the cgl equation before proceeding to the description of the phase diagram .    early work on cgl has dealt with the problem of the linear stability of its family of plane - wave solutions @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . 
 all these solutions are unstable for @xmath10 ( newell criterion ) , a condition which defines the so - called `` benjamin - feir '' ( bf ) line ( fig .  1 ) . 
 for @xmath11 , plane - wave solutions with @xmath12 are linearly stable  @xcite . 
 the instability of the travelling wave solutions above the bf line is readily verified as to be linked to the `` gauge '' invariance of the equation , i.e. its invariance by an arbitrary phase shift ( @xmath13 ) . near the bf line , 
 the amplitude modes are strongly damped , `` slaved '' to the marginal phase mode , so that one often speaks of a _ phase instability_. this instability has been conjectured to lead to a disordered regime called _ phase turbulence _ 
 @xcite , in which the field @xmath1 never reaches zero , so that the phase @xmath14 is defined everywhere . near the bf line 
 , the phase gradient @xmath15 is expected to remain small , and a systematic expansion can be performed , leading to a description of the large - scale dynamics in terms of the phase only . 
 the behavior of the resulting series of _ phase equations _ obtained by truncation of this expansion is actually not very well known , except for the kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) equation to which these equations reduce infinitely close to the bf line . if phase turbulence ( i.e. spatiotemporal chaos ) has been established for the ks equation , it is the subject of an ongoing controversy away from the bf line , both for the phase equations and for the cgl equation itself  @xcite . 
 another important feature of the cgl equation is the structure , nature , and role of `` defects '' , i.e. points in space - time where @xmath16 . at such points , the phase is not defined , and it varies by a multiple of @xmath17 when going around them . for space dimensions @xmath18 , defects are topologically constrained 
 this has been recognized for a long time as one of the salient features of the two - dimensional cgl  @xcite . for @xmath19 , defects are points and can only appear and disappear by pairs . for small enough @xmath2 values , they appear in two different types , `` spirals '' and `` shock - line vertices '' ( fig .  2 ) . 
 the shock - line vertices have mostly been considered as `` passive '' objects which play no important role . 
 however accurate this statement may be , it remains that the spiral defects have attracted the most attention  @xcite . in spite of all these efforts , 
 no exact expression is available ; on the other hand , much is known about the core structure and the `` wings '' , i.e. the emitted outward - going waves . 
 away from the core , these waves are asymptotic to a planewave with a well - defined wavenumber @xmath20 depending only on @xmath2 and @xmath3 . 
 the stability properties of the @xmath21 planewave solution give rise to two important lines in the @xmath22 parameter plane . on the   line , 
 @xmath23 , the maximum wavenumber of linearly stable planewaves ( fig .  1 ) . 
 this line delimits the region of linear stability of the @xmath21 wave . to its left , 
 the wave is linearly unstable ( perturbations grow exponentially in phase space ) ; this is in fact a _ convective _ instability : a _ localized _ perturbation indeed grows , but is advected away from its initial position at the group velocity of the @xmath21 planewave . at this initial position 
 , the solution relaxes to the planewave . according to aranson et al . 
 @xcite , the @xmath21 planewave becomes _ absolutely _ unstable to the left of the   line : any initial perturbation grows at its initial location ( in addition to spreading in the direction of the wave ) .     with periodic boundary conditions and parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .

 we now formulate , at a somewhat conjectural level , the stability properties of the spiral solution and their consequences observable in experiments ( be they numerical or not ) . to the right of line , 
 one expects the spiral to resist a ( small ) amount of noise , due to its `` complete '' ( core and wings ) linear stability . between   and 
 , perturbations are amplified but convected away from the core at the group velocity of the @xmath21 solution . 
 numerical experiments have shown that the spiral is most sensitive to perturbations in the crossover region between the core and the wings  @xcite . at a given level of ( experimental ) noise , 
 perturbations coming from this region are the most dangerous ones . 
 this convective instability in fact takes the form of growing oscillations of the _ modulus _ @xmath26 as one goes away from the core ( see fig . 
 experimentally , these oscillations do not saturate , and the wave breaks down , creating more defects . 
 this mechanism defines a maximum radius @xmath31 which limits the size of observable spirals , and depends on the instability rate and ( weakly ) on the noise level . approaching the limit of absolute instability ( line ) 
 , this diameter goes to zero , and beyond   the spiral is `` completely '' unstable and can not be observed in an experimental ( noisy ) context . 
 finally , we note that if defects do play an important role in the two - dimensional cgl equation , as we will show below , their topological character is not crucial in determining the dynamical regimes : for @xmath32 , localized `` quasi - defects '' where @xmath26 remains locally very close to zero have been shown to be the key - ingredient in some disordered regimes  @xcite . 
 but the topological constraint on defects for @xmath18 does provide them with a large domain of existence in parameter space , insuring their relevance in most of the regimes of interest . 
 fig .  1 shows the phase diagram of the two - dimensional cgl equation established from a numerical exploration of systems of linear size of the order of @xmath33 with periodic boundary conditions , using a pseudospectral code . 
 details about the integration scheme and the numerical protocol will be given elsewhere  @xcite . 
 the various transition lines are discussed in detail in section  4 .    as in the one - dimensional case 
 @xcite , two types of disordered regimes can be distinguished , depending on whether they exhibit defects or not . to the right of the line l in the parameter plane , _ phase turbulence _ 
 ( no defects ) is observed , whereas _ defect turbulence _ 
 occurs to the left of line t.      between the bf and the l lines , spatiotemporally chaotic regimes of phase turbulence where no defect occurs are observed . with periodic boundary conditions , the total phase gradient across the system ( the `` winding number '' ) 
 is conserved . 
 this introduces a new invariant to the problem . 
 most results reported here ( in particular the location of line l ) are for the case of zero winding number .     with periodic boundary conditions and parameters @xmath24 and @xmath34 .

 the typical size of the cells diverges like @xmath39 when approaching the bf line ; this size is in fact of the order of the wavelength of the most unstable mode in the corresponding ks equation . if the correlations of the modulus @xmath26 still decay rapidly , those of the phase @xmath40 decay slowly , with power - law - like behavior . 
 this is apparent in the large - scale modulations of the phase field ( fig . 
 3b ) . in section  5 
 , we discuss the effective large - scale model for phase turbulence and the asymptotic behavior of the correlations in phase turbulence . 
 even though they are certainly important to better understanding the dynamics of phase turbulence , the `` elementary processes '' at play in this regime are not known . for @xmath32 
 , it has been shown that propagative structures are the objects triggering the breakdown of phase turbulence  @xcite . here 
 , no equivalent has so far been found ( see below ) . 
 one should also investigate whether the evolution of the cellular structure involves some of the elementary events observed in the coarsening of soap froths  @xcite ( even though these can not account for all the dynamics here , since the cellular structure is statistically stationary ) . 
 knowledge of the local dynamics is necessary to build a large - scale effective description of two - dimensional phase turbulence in the spirit of the work of chow and hwa  @xcite for the one - dimensional ks equation . 
 defect turbulence is the most chaotic regime of the two - dimensional cgl equation : correlations decay exponentially , with short correlation lengths and times . 
 depending mostly on @xmath2 , the space - time signature of the solutions varies . for large @xmath2 , 
 the density of defects is large , they come and go rapidly , and they rarely form spirals ( fig .  4 ) . 
 indeed , it can be argued that defects _ 
 per se _ are not crucial features in this case . 
 `` amplitude turbulence '' is a better name for such spatiotemporal chaos regimes . 
 furthermore , increasing @xmath2 toward the nonlinear schrdinger equation limit , _ pulses _ become the relevant objects : the solutions consist of localized regions where @xmath41 . approaching the bf line , the defect density decreases , the characteristic scales increase , and spirals 
 can be observed . 
 in fact well - developed spirals can only be observed , in the defect turbulence region , to the right of the   line ( see the discussion of the transition lines in the next section ) .     with parameters @xmath42 ( a - b ) and @xmath43 ( c - d ) . 
 there are 268 defects in the first case , but no well - formed spirals are observed ; in the second case , on the other hand , spirals are clearly visible .

 the field @xmath26 is generally completely stationary in time . 
 the network of these lines form the cells of these spatially - disordered states ( fig . 
 non - spiral defects lie at the shock - line vertices , sometimes also along the shock lines themselves , in metastable arrangements . because the timescales involved are very long , it is actually difficult to decide when these structures stop evolving . 
 residual , intermittent , local rearrangements  less and less frequent along time are observed , and this relaxation process is reminiscent of that taking place in glasses . 
 in fact , much remains to be done in order to decide to what extent these dynamical states are glassy states . 
 a first study along these lines can be found in huber  @xcite . 
 a particular point of interest is to investigate whether some kind of aging phenomena are taking place in these frozen structures . 
 the frozen states are easily observed in the region of the parameter space to the right of line t , where they are the only asymptotic solutions possessing defects . 
 their total domain of existence in the @xmath22 plane can be estimated on the basis of the stability properties of spirals , as discussed in section  2 . 
 the frozen states do not exist to the left of line , since there the spirals are absolutely unstable . on the other hand 
 , nothing precludes their existence to the right of . 
 the size of the cells is not limited , except in the presence of noise , since in this case , between   and , spirals have a maximum radius @xmath31 . in practice , 
 the dynamical `` history '' which led to a given frozen structure greatly influences the distribution of sizes of cells in the structure ( see the discussion in section  4.1 below ) .     with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath46 . 
 ( a ) : field @xmath26 ; color scale from @xmath27 ( dark red ) to @xmath47 ( light yellow ) ; ( b ) : lines @xmath29 ( green ) and @xmath29 ( red).,title=""fig : "" ] with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath46 . ( 
 a ) : field @xmath26 ; color scale from @xmath27 ( dark red ) to @xmath47 ( light yellow ) ; ( b ) : lines @xmath29 ( green ) and @xmath29 ( red).,title=""fig : "" ]    the actual observation of frozen states in the region between lines   and t , where defect turbulence exists , is not easy , though , because these states are metastable with respect to defect turbulence . 
 coming , for example , from a frozen asymptotic state to the right of line t , the parameters have to be changed `` adiabatically '' to prevent the nucleation of defect turbulence . 
 even then , the necessary rearrangements of the cellular structure , which involve the rapid motion of some defects , most often trigger the `` melting '' of the frozen structure . 
 frozen structures are most easily observed far to the right of line t , and especially to the right of . 
 their domain of existence probably extends to large values of @xmath3 ( except maybe for large @xmath48 ) . at any rate , along the @xmath49 axis 
 , it extends to the real ginzburg - landau ( @xmath50 ) limit , where the spirals become the vortex excitations of the xy model  @xcite . 
 the respective domains of existence of the three disordered phases described above are delimited by the lines bf , t , l , and . 
 we discuss now the nature of the various ( phase ) transitions observed when crossing these lines and comment on the relative stability of the disordered phases . 
 as already mentioned , line t delimits the ( numerically estimated ) domain of existence of _ sustained _ regimes of defect turbulence . starting from a defect turbulence regime , _ increasing @xmath3 
 _ , this highly chaotic regime is maintained until line t is crossed ; defect turbulence is only transient then , and is followed by the nucleation of a frozen state ( fig . 
 6 ) . as observed by huber et al . 
 @xcite , this transition is indeed reminiscent of a first - order phase transition . depending both on the amplitude of 
 the `` quench '' beyond line t ( i.e. the distance of the current parameters to line t ) and the @xmath2 value of the crossing point , the duration of the transient varies widely . 
 the smaller the quench and the larger @xmath2 , the longer the transient . as a matter of fact , 
 line t can be seen as the line where this transient is infinite . 
 the nucleation process involves the appearance of a sufficiently large spiral core . to the right of line t , the spiral may then grow , but its size is limited to a maximum radius @xmath51 ( fig . 
 this radius results from the interaction between the outward - going spiral waves and the strong , finite - amplitude fluctuations characteristic of the defect turbulence `` bath '' surrounding it . 
 these fluctuations trigger the most unstable mode of the spiral solutions , i.e. the oscillations of @xmath26 which are the signature of the nonlinear stage of the convective instability , and influence the spiral wave _ inward_. we stress that this is different from the problem usually considered when studying convective instabilities . here a semi - infinite convectively - unstable medium is put in contact `` downstream '' with a turbulent medium . 
 the balance between the ( destabilizing ) turbulent fluctuations and the ( regularizing ) advection of perturbations by the spiral waves takes place at the nonlinear level , so that the radius @xmath51 can not be determined from the stability properties of the spiral alone  @xcite . 
 approaching line t from the right , @xmath51 decreases . 
 numerical experiments  @xcite show that the line t where @xmath52 ( not shown in fig . 
 1 ) is located to the _ left _ of line t. note that , in contrast with line t , line t is defined _ via _ a local dynamical phenomenon . in the region between lines t and t , `` fully developed '' defect turbulence decays to mixed states , i.e. mostly - frozen structures in which some localized patches of turbulence subsist ( fig . 
 6b ) . numerically speaking 
 , this residual turbulence does not seem to vanish at long times ; extensive statistical data has to be compiled in order to decide whether this remains true in the infinite - time limit , in which case lines t and t are distinct . in the other case , one must conclude that line t , in the thermodynamic limit , moves to the left to coalesce with line t. however , in a similar fashion to what happens with line l in phase turbulence ( see next section ) , line t is numerically well - defined for all practical purposes , and it is only a theoretical point to know whether it is distinct from t in the infinite - time limit . 
 we note finally that the frozen states nucleated this way ( i.e. from the spontaneous decay of defect turbulence ) possess a maximal cell size given by @xmath51 .     with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath34 . 
 ( a ) : two spirals have been nucleated and have reached their maximal size @xmath53 ; ( b ) : asymptotic state consisting of a frozen structure of spirals with maximum radius @xmath51 with some residual turbulence for @xmath54 , @xmath24 , and @xmath55 . 
 this asymptotic state is typical of the region between lines t and t ( compare with fig .  5 ) . 
 ( snapshots of field @xmath26 , color scale from @xmath27 ( dark red ) to @xmath56 ( light yellow ) ) . note the oscillations of @xmath26 away from the spiral cores , near their maximum radius , which are the signature of the convective instability of the @xmath21 planewave.,title=""fig : "" ] with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath34 .

 6b , coexist in the region between lines t and t ) . 
 as mentioned in section  3 , line   is only an absolute and approximate limit of the hysteresis region : in theory , the effects of the curvature of the waves and the spiral core should be taken into account , and in practice , in this region of parameter space , the frozen states are easily destroyed by perturbations , so that it is extremely difficult to observe the frozen states far to the left of line t. in fact , the real limit of existence of frozen states might be actually determined by the properties of the _ nonlinear _ stage of the convective instability of the waves and possibly also by the stability properties of the shock - line vertices , the other key - component of frozen structures . 
 this very intricate situation will be examined in detail in @xcite . 
 the distance between lines t and   is thus only an approximate measure of the _ maximal _ width of the hysteresis loop . 
 line l is the ( numerically - determined ) line beyond which ( to its left ) phase turbulence is only transient . to its right , phase turbulence can be observed for as big a system and as long a time as current computers allow 
 . a brief discussion of the existence of phase turbulence in the infinite - size , infinite - time limit is given in the next section , but , numerically speaking , line l is rather well defined , with the probability of breakdown of phase turbulence being finite to its left and essentially zero to its right .     with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath57 coming from a phase turbulent system at @xmath24 and @xmath34 .

 a pair of defects is nucleated by some fluctuation on one side of a cell , triggering a `` chain - reaction '' leading to the quasi - deterministic invasion of the system by a growing bubble of the defect turbulence phase . 
 the diameter of this bubble increases linearly with time ( fig . 
 a priori , three sections of line l have to be considered , delimited by the crossing points with lines t and   ( or , rather , the line actually delimiting the existence of frozen states ) . below line t , the only possible regime is defect turbulence , so that the breakdown of phase turbulence can only lead to this regime . between lines   and t , 
 defect turbulence and frozen states coexist , and the breakdown could lead to either state . in fact , the nucleation events at the origin of the breakdown are always highly chaotic , and only defect turbulence arises ( this is not surprising , considering the metastability of frozen states in this region ) . 
 the third portion of line l , above its crossing with line t , offers an interesting possibility : there , only frozen states are expected asymptotically . 
 but the breakdown of phase turbulence first triggers a defect turbulence transient which then itself nucleates a frozen state . 
 no direct transition from phase turbulence to frozen states seems possible , although it is conceivable that one might observe , in a large system , a nucleating frozen state within the growing bubble of defect turbulence invading phase turbulence . 
 finally , we note , not surprisingly , that the breakdown of phase turbulence is also an hysteretic transition . crossing line l from left to right 
 , one remains in either defect turbulence or a frozen state . 
 after this brief description of the `` phase diagram '' , we comment on important related points as well as some theoretical problems currently under investigation . 
 the phase diagram of fig .  1 summarizes numerical results . as such , even though customary precautions have been taken ( e.g. to insure the extensivity of chaos in the disordered regimes ) , it does not represent the `` true '' phase diagram , i.e. that of the infinite - size , infinite - time , `` thermodynamic '' limit . 
 this question , which also arises in the @xmath32 case , has been recently investigated  @xcite , in particular with respect to the existence of phase turbulence in the thermodynamic limit ( represented by line l here ) . 
 indeed , the very existence of phase turbulence is questioned . as for the @xmath32 case , 
 it is currently impossible to make a definitive statement , on the basis of numerical simulations alone , as to whether line l coalesces with the bf line in the thermodynamic limit . 
 a careful analysis of statistical data about phase turbulence in one and two dimensions for various system sizes and integration times is under way and will be reported elsewhere  @xcite . 
 extrapolation of size effects , though , seems to lead to the conclusion that phase turbulence might not exist in the thermodynamic limit . 
 it remains nevertheless that for all practical purposes ( numerical or experimental ) , there exists a domain of parameter space where phase turbulence is statistically stationary and subsists even in very large systems for times as long as desired . at any rate , fig . 
 1 is representative of system sizes and integration times accessible to current computers ( say up to linear size l of the order of @xmath61 and integration times up to @xmath62 ) , and line l is probably slightly shifted for much larger systems . 
 the status of line t , which delimits the domain of existence of sustained regimes of defect turbulence , is subjected to similar remarks . 
 statistical data about the probability of breakdown ( to a frozen state ) should be cumulated in order to estimate the position of line t in the thermodynamic limit . 
 this should be completed by a detailed study of the variation of @xmath51 with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 to provide a precise determination of line t. the question , raised in section  4.1 , of whether lines t and t coalesce in the thermodynamic limit , could thus be addressed . 
 the existence of defect turbulence is not in question , though , as line t is bound to be situated to the right of line   ( which limits absolutely the domain of existence of frozen states ) . 
 cellular structures appear both in phase turbulence ( fig .  3 ) and 
 , of course , as frozen states ( fig .  5 ) . in phase turbulence , 
 the dynamics produces statistically stationary configurations which can be studied along the lines of what is usually done for , say , the coarsening of soap froths  @xcite . for example 
 , a first step would be to estimate the statistical properties of cells their sizes , their number of sides and a second stage could consist in determining the local events of which their dynamical evolution is composed . as mentioned in section  3.2 , this should provide a better understanding of the elementary processes involved in phase turbulence , as well as a better statistical description of this regime . 
 this could also pave the way to a simple `` particle model '' sharing the same statistical properties , similar to the work of rost and krug  @xcite on the ks equation . in the case of the frozen states , 
 as discussed earlier , the characteristics of the structures depend strongly on the `` dynamical history '' that led to them , so that an investigation of their geometrical properties must be correlated to their origin and formation . 
 admittedly , the phase diagram of fig . 
 1 is not quite complete . 
 work remains to be done , in particular on the three following points :    * the @xmath63 , `` nonlinear schrdinger '' , limit needs to be clarified : where are lines   and t located ? 
 how does the _ core _ instability of spirals intervene in the dynamical regimes ? * the @xmath64 region , and especially the prolongation of line t , should be investigated , as well as the @xmath65 limit . 
 * it is known that , at least for @xmath32 , the cgl equation exhibits well - behaved disordered regimes in some parts of the @xmath66 half - plane  @xcite , in spite of the absence of the usual nonlinear saturation mechanism . 
 such a possibility should also be explored in the two - dimensional case . * 
 the processes of nucleation of the spiral cores should be studied in detail , at least from a statistical point of view . in particular , the minimal core size that can possibly lead to the growth of a spiral should be estimated , as well as the probability of such an event . 
 this would help define a line to the right of line t beyond which nucleation is immediate ( corresponding to the line `` nuc '' in @xcite ) , as well as clarify the nature of the frozen states with residual turbulence observed experimentally between lines t and t.      the possibility of large - scale descriptions of deterministic spatiotemporal chaos in terms of langevin - like , ( nonlinear ) stochastic equations , is a question currently being debated , essentially because one can then hope to apply methods of statistical mechanics  @xcite . 
 one central point is to investigate to what extent and under what conditions the local chaotic fluctuations are equivalent to a `` noise '' at large scales . 
 the cgl equation offers , here also , a good testground for such questions . in this spirit 
 , phase turbulence has been proposed  @xcite to be described , at large scales , by the noisy burgers or kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz )  @xcite equation , which is ( among other things ) a model for the kinetic roughening of stochastic interfaces . 
 indeed , since the phase @xmath14 is always defined in this regime , one can consider the evolution of the phase field only ( at least on an experimental level ) , which , in turn , can be seen as the progression of a @xmath67-dimensional interface in a @xmath68-dimensional medium ( unwinding the phase advance on the real axis ) . 
 numerical results for @xmath32 and @xmath19 seem to confirm the validity of the kpz ansatz  @xcite . 
 the kpz picture also reveals the asymptotic behavior of correlations in phase turbulence . in particular , spatial correlations of the phase should decrease either algebraically ( `` linear regime '' of kpz ) or like a stretched exponential ( `` nonlinear regime '' ) .    to go beyond this type of numerical observation 
 , the effective large - scale stochastic equation has to be built from the original model . 
 an important step toward this aim has been achieved recently for the one - dimensional kuramoto - sivashinsky equation ( which is also believed to be described by kpz at large scales  @xcite ) . carefully studying the elementary mechanisms at the origin of spatiotemporal chaos , chow and hwa  @xcite 
 have succeeded in calculating , from data on local chaos only , the parameters of the effective kpz equation . 
 it is not clear how such a program could be carried out for the cgl equation in any of its disordered regimes even for phase turbulence , but a detailed analysis of the elementary processes at work in each case appears as a necessary step deserving further work . 
 the general picture of the two - dimensional cgl equation presented here , even though it should be completed along the lines mentioned above , already provides a good starting point to people wanting to study various aspects of spatiotemporal chaos in this system . 
 in particular , our study should help choose specific parameter values . 
 it should also help experimentalists recognize whether the physical or numerical problems they study are typical of the cgl equation and , if so , of what particular regime . 
 finally , natural extensions of this work include a similar study of the three - dimensional case , and of the various modifications of cgl usually considered in the literature .

17,"the study of lithium in metal - poor stars has implications for stellar structure , galactic chemical evolution , and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . 
 there has thus been considerable observational and theoretical effort on this question , and we will therefore attempt to draw together the main themes and outstanding questions rather than undertake a detailed analysis of the fine points . this paper will be organized as follows . in section 2 , 
 we recall the main trends of the theoretical expectations . in section 3 
 , we discuss the major features of the observational data ; in particular we stress the similarities and differences with the population i pattern . 
 section 4 is devoted to the comparison of different classes of theoretical models with the data , and our conclusions are summarized in section 5 . 
 let us first briefly recall that the so - called standard case refers to models which exclude any kind of transport processes of the chemicals in the radiative zones , and thus consider only convection as a mixing mechanism . 
 lithium is destroyed at moderate temperature by stellar interior standards ; for typical main sequence ( ms ) and pre - ms densities , li@xmath0 burns at a time scale comparable to or shorter than the evolutionary time scale at around 2 million k and li@xmath1 burns at around 2.6 million k. both beryllium and boron are less fragile , with characteristic burning temperatures of order 3.5 million k and 5 million k respectively . because the observational data points to modest lithium depletion in halo stars ( and even this conclusion is controversial ! ) we will restrict our discussion of light element depletion to lithium . 
 the major predictions of classical ( sometimes referred to as standard ) stellar evolution models for halo stars are summarized in deliyannis et al . 
 they depend mainly on the variations of the depth of the stellar convective envelope ( and thus of the temperature at its base ) with the stellar mass , metallicity and evolutionary stage . pre - ms depletion increases with decreased mass , and there will therefore be a strong decrease of lithium with decreased @xmath2 for cool stars . 
 main sequence depletion is predicted to be minimal for all but the coolest stars ; the absolute degree of lithium depletion decreases with decreased metal abundance . 
 the net effect predicted is that hot halo dwarfs should exhibit little or no dependence of their surface lithium abundance on effective temperature , and for the lowest metal abundances there should be a minimal dependence on [ fe / h ] , in the sense that lower abundances would be predicted for higher metallicities . 
 this implies a small dispersion in lithium at fixed effective temperature ; in the population i case , it also implies a weak dependence of lithium on age which can be tested in open clusters . 
 classical stellar models neglect some physical processes which are known to be important for interpreting the surface lithium abundances of stars . 
 the linked phenomena of gravitational settling and thermal diffusion , which are solidly based in our knowledge of plasma physics , are among the most important . 
 atomic diffusion is a fundamental process which must occur in the stellar gas unless some macroscopic motions counteract it , causing heavy elements to sink with respect to light ones under the conditions applicable for halo dwarfs . 
 the time scale for this process decreases as the depth of the surface convection zone decreases . 
 theoretical models which include pure atomic diffusion ( see michaud et al . 
 1984 for the first computations for halo stars ) therefore predict that lithium sinks below the surface convection zone for the conditions appropriate for subdwarfs , and furthermore that the degree of diffusion increases with increased @xmath2 . 
 microscopic diffusion will not generate a dispersion in abundance at fixed @xmath2 , and the effects at a given surface temperature are not strongly metallicity dependent . 
 stellar winds can counteract and prevent atomic diffusion without leading to nuclear destruction ( vauclair & charbonnel 1995 ) . the corresponding mass loss necessary in the hottest halo stars is in excess of the value inferred from an extrapolation of the solar mdot to halo stars by a factor of about 10 to 30 , but not by a degree that can be ruled out observationally . for even larger mass loss rates the outer layers containing lithium can be removed ; as noted by swenson & faulkner ( 1992 ) the finite depth of the surface convection zone must be accounted for and models with strong ( stronger than inferred by vauclair & charbonnel 1995 ) mass loss alone are incompatible with the population i lithium pattern . for hot halo stars the combined effect of diffusion and mass loss produce both lithium depletion and a small dispersion in abundance . 
 there are known mechanisms for mild mixing in the radiative envelopes of low mass stars . 
 the two most frequently studied are rotationally - induced mixing and turbulence induced by gravity waves ( see pinsonneault 1997 for a review and dpc ) . 
 gravity waves can be produced by turbulence in the surface convection zone ; because the convection zone depth is a strong function of mass , this can produce mass - dependent lithium depletion that is a function of time on the main sequence . 
 it would not produce a dispersion in abundance for a sample of uniform age and composition , but abundance differences could be generated by a range of age and composition as seen in field halo stars . 
 the degree of rotational mixing depends on several major factors . 
 low mass population i stars are observed to have a range of surface rotation rates and stars of the same mass , composition , and age could therefore have different initial angular momenta , different rotation rates as a function of time , and different degrees of rotational mixing . a dispersion in surface lithium abundance , even at fixed effective temperature in clusters , 
 is therefore expected . however , the observed distribution of rotation rates in young clusters is nongaussian which strongly affects the expected lithium depletion pattern . 
 we also can not directly observe the initial conditions for population ii stars . 
 to predict the detailed distribution of abundances the best we can to is to infer the distribution of initial conditions from young open cluster stars ( see pinsonneault et al . 
 1999 , hereafter pwsn ) . 
 the degree of mixing is also directly linked to the internal transport of angular momentum ( e.g. , zahn 1992 , maeder 1995 ) . 
 rotational mixing can also be inhibited by gradients in mean molecular weight - induced by nuclear burning in the cores of stars and possibly also by gravitational settling of helium in their outer layers ( see also michaud and vauclair in these proceedings ) . 
 in contrast with classical models , more modern models including mild mixing below the envelope on the main sequence can simultaneously produce modest depletions of species , such as lithium and beryllium , that burn at very different temperatures . 
 rotational mixing will also be a function of age , and some classes of models predict trends with [ fe / h ] and effective temperature that can be tested in halo stars . 
 realistic models should include the possible interactions between the above , since mass loss can counteract atomic diffusion and diffusion can interact with mixing ( also see michaud , these proceedings ) . 
 we note that vauclair ( these proceedings ) has proposed a nonlinear interaction between mixing and microscopic diffusion which would permit negligible halo star lithium depletion ; note , however , that the details of such an interaction need to be computed and that such a cancellation would still have to be consistent with the globular cluster and population i star data . 
 as we have just seen the surface lithium abundances of stars are sensitive to a variety of effects , both those accounted for in classical stellar models and those caused by physically well - motivated but still so - called non - standard effects . 
 uniqueness is thus a real issue when interpreting the observational data . 
 we will therefore begin with the overall conclusions from studies of population i stars , and then proceed to the current status of the observational data for population ii stars . 
 the properties of population i stars are summarized in dpc . here 
 we briefly recall those that are important for the problem of lithium depletion in population ii stars . in progressively older open cluster stars 
 there is clear evidence for increased lithium depletion with age and a dispersion in abundance at fixed @xmath2 which is inconsistent with classical models . 
 the predicted dropoff of lithium for cool stars from pre - ms burning is clearly seen . 
 the overall properties favor mild mixing below the envelope on the ms ; there is also evidence for microscopic diffusion playing a role for f stars and in the helioseismic inversions of the solar sound speed relative to theoretical models ( see guzik & cox 1993 , richard et al . 
 1996 , basu et al . 
 large enough amounts of mass loss to directly cause lithium depletion are inconsistent with the observed population i pattern ( swenson & faulkner 1992 ) . as of this time 
 a single theoretical model capable of explaining all of the population i data has not yet been found ( talon & charbonnel 1998 , pwsn ) .      beginning with the pioneering work of spite & spite ( 1982 ) , 
 there have been a series of progressively more sophisticated observational studies of lithium in halo field stars ; the largest sample is that of thorburn ( 1994 ) . 
 ryan et al . 
 ( 1999 , hereafter rnb ) obtained a smaller sample with a lower formal error ( @xmath3 @xmath4 0.036 dex ) than the errors in earlier studies ( @xmath3 @xmath4 0.07 - 0.09 dex ) . 
 there have also been preliminary studies of small samples of stars near the turnoff in globular clusters . 
 different investigators of field stars agree on some general properties :    \1 . 
 halo stars hotter than 5800 k exhibit a weaker dependence on @xmath2 , [ fe / h ] , and a smaller dispersion than seen in population i stars . 
 there is vigorous debate about the existence and magnitude of any dispersion in the field star case , and there are active controversies about trends with @xmath2 and [ fe / h ] . 
 turnoff globular cluster stars were first studied by molaro & pasquini ( 1994 ) , who reported a li abundance for a turnoff star in ngc 6397 consistent with the halo plateau abundances . 
 these are technically challenging observations owing to the faintness of the stars and the need for high resolution spectroscopy . 
 a subsequent keck study of the globular cluster m92 ( deliyannis et al . 
 1995 , boesgaard et al . 
 1998 ) revealed a large scatter , similar in morphology to the old open cluster m67 . 
 the sample , however , is small ( seven stars , including only three with s / n greater than 40 ) . 
 pasquini & molaro ( 1997 ) also observed a range of li abundances in three turnoff stars in the intermediate metal abundance globular cluster 47 tuc . 
 any successful theory must explain both the cluster and field star patterns ; more data is clearly needed for the globular cluster stars ( see also part iii , charbonnel , deliyannis & pinsonneault ) . 
 we now turn to a summary of the most recent data on the important global features in field halo stars . 
 there has been a spirited debate about the existence and magnitude of trends in the halo star data with metallicity and effective temperature . 
 the slope with metal abundance is important for constraining the galactic chemical evolution contribution to the observed lithium abundances , and it may also contribute to the small scatter in the data at fixed effective temperature . 
 trends with effective temperature are important as a diagnostic of the mass dependence of any physical processes which affect the surface abundances . 
 thorburn ( 1994 ) reported evidence for a positive slope of lithium with respect to @xmath2 ; this conclusion was challenged by molaro et al . 
 subsequently ryan et al . 
 ( 1996 ) reanalyzed their data , claiming confirmation of the original results ; see also bonifacio & molaro ( 1997 ) . 
 the existence of a modest rising trend with increased t@xmath5 is only predicted in the models including atomic diffusion and stellar winds ( vauclair & charbonnel 1995 ) . 
 however , what is even more important than the existence of a mild mean trend is the thing which is _ not _ seen : any evidence for a decline in lithium among the hottest stars . 
 as discussed above , models which include only microscopic diffusion predict a decline in surface lithium for the hottest halo stars ; models with strong depletion from mixing also predict a downwards trend in lithium for the hottest stars ( chaboyer & demarque 1994 ) . 
 this observational fact therefore constitutes an important limit on lithium depletion in halo stars . 
 the existence of trends of lithium with metallicity is a signature of galactic chemical evolution , and it could also contribute to the dispersion observed in halo stars . 
 the majority of the observational investigations have looked for a correlation between [ li ] and [ fe / h ] ; in parallel to the controversy over trends with effective temperature , there have been conflicting results on metallicity trends . both thorburn ( 1994 ) and ryan et al . 
 ( 1996 ) found some evidence for an increase in [ li ] with [ fe / h ] with a slope of order 0.1 . 
 this was disputed by molaro et al . 
 ( 1995 ) and bonifacio & molaro ( 1997 ) . 
 rnb obtained a sample with a small intrinsic range in effective temperature , but a wider range in metallicity . 
 they could therefore evaluate metallicity but not effective temperature trends , and found a slope of [ li ] with respect to [ fe / h ] consistent with the thorburn ( 1994 ) level . 
 chemical evolution trends should most logically be evaluated in the linear li - linear fe / h plane ( see olive and matteucci , these proceedings ) . 
 a general feature of the derived chemical evolution trends is that they are sensitive to the source used for the metallicity , the subset of the data which is used , and the treatment of outliers in the fit . 
 ryan et al . 
 ( 1996 ) also noted that the evidence for trends in the data with @xmath2 and [ fe / h ] is more convincing in a bivariate analysis than when either variable is treated separately . 
 the existence and magnitude of metallicity trends is also important for the interpretation of the dispersion in abundance ( see below ) . 
 the metallicity dependence of any rotational mixing is small ( pwsn ) and would be difficult to disentangle from chemical evolution effects . 
 the dispersion in the lithium abundances of halo plateau stars has been the subject of a number of studies . 
 this is largely because the existence or absence of a detectable range in abundance at fixed metallicity and @xmath2 is the best direct test and constraint on the transport processes of chemicals in these stars . 
 lithium abundances can be studied as a function of age in the population i case , which makes it easier to unambiguously distinguish between different classes of theoretical models ( or at least rule bad models out ) . 
 all of the metal - poor stars that we observe are old , and we therefore can not directly reconstruct the depletion of lithium by sorting stars of progressively increased age into an evolutionary sequence . 
 studies of the dispersion tend to fall into two groups . some investigators ( deliyannis et al . 
 1993 , thorburn 1994 ) found evidence for a dispersion at a low level ; others ( spite et al . 
 1996 , bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) placed bounds on the dispersion consistent with their observational errors . 
 the level of dispersion inferred by deliyannis et al . 
 ( 1993 ) is not inconsistent with the latter two studies ( greater than 0.04 dex as compared with less than 0.08 and 0.07 dex respectively ) . in a recent paper , 
 rnb have claimed a more stringent constraint on the overall dispersion . 
 we examine this most recent data set below ; a comparison of models including rotational mixing with the thorburn ( 1994 ) data set was performed by pwsn . 
 the formal dispersion of the rnb data set is 0.053 dex , greater than their observational error of 0.036 . 
 they attribute this to a correlation between metallicity and lithium abundance , e.g. chemical evolution rather than stellar depletion . 
 there is a substantial overlap between the rnb and thorburn ( 1994 ) data sets , and the markedly lower dispersion inferred by rnb can be traced directly to differences in equivalent width measurements . in figure 1 
 we illustrate and compare the properties of the rnb sample ( excluding one upper limit ) with the stars in common as measured by thorburn ( 1994 ) ; both have been shifted to the same effective temperature scale . 
 there are both significant zero - point shifts and a marked difference in the overall dispersion of the sample . 
 rnb attribute this to possible scattered light and sky subtraction issues in the thorburn ( 1994 ) data set . 
 we note , however , that similar differences appear in samples in common with other investigators . the systematic differences between various observational data sets therefore require more scrutiny , especially given the relatively small sample size of the rnb data set and the small number of overdepleted stars expected for modest stellar depletion . 
 we compare the theoretical distribution of the lowest depletion case of pwsn to the rnb data in figure 2 . 
 the majority of young low mass stars in open clusters are slow rotators , which implies that they should have experienced similar rotational histories and similar degrees of rotational mixing . 
 however about 1/5 of the stars in open clusters are observed to be rapid rotators and these should manifest themselves as overdepleted objects , producing an excess dispersion which is measureable . 
 the existence of a core in the sample with minimal internal dispersion therefore does not by itself rule out more modest stellar destruction ( as noted by rnb ) . 
 the existence and number of outliers is a more stringent test . in the raw rnb sample 
 there are three stars more than 0.1 dex below the median , one of which has an upper limit of 1.36 for its abundance ; this simulation would predict  4 depending on the criterion for defining what constitutes an overdepleted star . 
 it is legitimate to question whether the highly overdepleted star is produced by the same mechanism as the other stars , but in any case the sample size is small and it is certainly difficult to make a persuasive case against modest depletion factors based on the data without chemical evolution corrections . 
 rnb placed more stringent constraints than the above based upon attributing some of their small dispersion to galactic chemical evolution . 
 rnb fitted the data for a trend with [ fe / h ] and concluded that there was a 10 % probability that as few outliers ( one ) as observed would be present by chance . 
 this conclusion depends on the usage of a logarithmic , rather than a linear , relationship between lithium abundance and metallicity ( pinsonneault et al . 
 2000 ) . in conclusion , the rnb data places more severe constraints on the dispersion in abundance than previous studies , and depending on the treatment of trends with metal abundance it may either be consistent with modest stellar depletion factors or places a bound of order 0.1 dex on the absolute depletion from the class of rotational mixing models considered by pwsn . 
 the existence of stars above the plateau may also provide some important clues ; they could either be underdepleted or they could have experienced lithium production . 
 stars with very low initial angular momentum would experience much less rotational mixing than the norm and would therefore appear as underdepleted . 
 however , there are strong observational selection effects against detecting very slow rotators in open clusters , and it is therefore difficult to estimate the fraction of such objects that would be expected in rotational mixing models . 
 an alternative explanation would be differential lithium production . 
 king et al . ( 1996 ) examined the most prominent such star , bd+23:3912 , and found no evidence for lithium production in the abundances of other elements that would be affected by the main mechanisms ( see king et al . 
 1996 for a detailed discussion and caveats ) . 
 li@xmath7 is more fragile than li@xmath8 and it is not produced in significant quantities in standard bbn models . 
 the detection of li@xmath7 in halo stars can therefore be used to set powerful constraints on the absolute depletion of li@xmath8 , with the caveat that the initial li@xmath7 abundance must be inferred from chemical evolution models . 
 smith et al . 
 ( 1993 ) first claimed a detection of li@xmath7 in the halo star hd 84937 . 
 this was confirmed in subsequent studies by different investigators who added two more possible detections and a number of upper limits ( see cayrel et al . 
 1999 , hobbs et al . 1999 , 
 nissen et al . 
 1999 for recent work on the subject and nissen in these proceedings ) . 
 the detected amount of li@xmath7 is small , but it appears to be secure . the amount is greater than would be expected from the beryllium and boron data , suggesting that alpha - alpha fusion may contribute to the production of li@xmath7 . 
 one important uncertainty in the usage of li@xmath7 data is therefore what the initial abundance of the species could be ; for example , lemoine et al . 
 ( 1996 ) and cayrel et al . 
 ( 1999 ) obtained bounds of a factor of four and three respectively on the absolute depletion of li@xmath7 in hd 84937 . 
 pwsn argued that an even higher initial abundance could not be excluded , and considered the extreme limiting case where the halo li@xmath7 abundance could have been as high as the solar system value . 
 the second uncertainty is the ratio of li@xmath7 to li@xmath8 depletion . 
 nuclear burning in the convective envelope in standard models would produce strong li@xmath7 depletion before any li@xmath8 depletion occurred ; this has been used to argue that any detected li@xmath7 implies negligible @xmath9 depletion ( e.g. lemoine et al . 
 both models with microscopic diffusion and models with mild envelope mixing , however , predict simultaneous detectable depletion of both isotopes to varying degrees , with li@xmath7 being more sensitive but not infinitely so ( see pwsn ) . 
 nonetheless , the li@xmath7 data does provide one of the best independent checks on any stellar depletion of li@xmath8 , and it indicates that large depletion factors are very unlikely to be consistent with the observed detections ( see below . ) 
 in light of the observational data above , what can we infer about the depletion of lithium in halo stars ? 
 the first and most generally agreed - upon conclusion is that a variety of observational tests make a large depletion factor unlikely . 
 there have been three major features of the halo data which have been used to constrain the absolute depletion : the degree of dispersion in the halo plateau , the detection of @xmath10 in some halo stars , and the absence of a decline in surface li for hotter halo stars . 
 pwsn inferred a range of 0.2 - 0.4 dex depletion factors from models including rotational mixing ; the lower end of the range was more consistent with the dispersion inferred from the thorburn ( 1994 ) data set , while the upper end of the range permitted the rare highly overdepleted stars to be explained within the framework of rotational mixing . as discussed above , 
 the most recent data set of rnb is marginally consistent with the lower end of the depletion range in pwsn ( of order 0.2 dex . ) 
 other investigators ( e.g. bonifacio & molaro 1997 , rnb ) have claimed more stringent limits of order 0.1 dex on the absolute depletion based upon the small ( or , in their view , nonexistent ! ) dispersion in the halo li data . 
 we will return to this claim after reviewing other measures based upon the detection of @xmath10 and the absence of the observed signature of pure microscopic diffusion in halo stars . 
 pwsn set a less severe , but firm , limit of 0.5 - 0.6 dex @xmath9 depletion from the measured @xmath10 / @xmath9 abundance ratios in halo stars under the assumption that the halo stars did not have a @xmath10 abundance higher than the solar system value . 
 lemoine et al . 
 ( 1996 ) derived a bound of a factor of 4 on the absolute @xmath10 depletion of hd 84937 , which in the rotationally mixed models of pwsn would imply a bound of  0.25 dex on the @xmath9 depletion , while cayrel et al . 
 ( 1999 ) used the lithium data in the same star to set a bound of 0.1 dex on its @xmath9 depletion ; both of these calculations , however , are dependent on the chemical evolution model which is used . 
 we note that if the cayrel et al . 
 ( 1999 ) bound of a factor of three @xmath10 depletion is used in conjunction with the pwsn models , an absolute @xmath9 depletion of  0.15 dex is inferred for hd 84937 rather than an upper limit of 0.1 dex . 
 vauclair & charbonnel ( 1998 ) used a different set of properties to infer a stellar depletion factor . 
 pure microscopic diffusion in halo models would produce a strong decrease in surface lithium with increased @xmath2 which is not observed . 
 it is therefore clear that something must be inhibiting microscopic diffusion , especially given the improved agreement with helioseismology from the inclusion of micrscopic diffusion in solar model calculations . 
 they noted that there is a subsurface peak in the @xmath9 abundance of the pure diffusion models which does not vary greatly across the plateau . 
 vauclair & charbonnel ( 1995 ) ( see also swenson 1995 ) argued that mass loss at a rate 10 - 30 times greater than the solar value could counteract the effects of diffusion if the rate was tuned across the lithium plateau . 
 this would have the effect of exposing a uniform abundance across the plateau , with an absolute depletion of 0.15 dex . 
 vauclair & charbonnel ( 1998 ) noted that in the presence of sufficiently mild mixing the height of this peak could be preserved , implying that a uniform depletion of order 0.15 dex could apply if the absence of a measurable surface signature of diffusion arose from either the competing effects of mass loss or the interaction of diffusion and mild mixing . 
 as noted by chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) , sufficiently strong mixing can cancel the effects of diffusion while not preserving the height of the peak ; however , models with the high degree of depletion inferred by that latter paper are difficult to reconcile with the other observational tests of lithium depletion .      in light of the remarkable observed properties of the halo lithium plateau 
 , it is reasonable to ask whether there is in fact any depletion at all . 
 in other words , are we directly seeing the primordial lithium abundance ( e.g. bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) or is the primordial lithium abundance in fact _ lower _ than the observed values because of a significant contribution from galactic chemical evolution ( rnb ) ? 
 `` standard '' stellar models are sometimes invoked as evidence against significant depletion . 
 these classical models , however , achieve this prediction by simply neglecting known physics rather than by demonstrating that it is unimportant . 
 for example , one could construct stellar models which ignore the cno cycle , and they might even agree with some data , but it does not follow that these should be placed on an equal physical basis with models that include the known nuclear physics . in particular , atomic diffusion can not be excluded arbitrarily from the computations , on the pretext that it produces unobserved features . this disagreement is a simple signature of some macroscopic motions ( mass loss or rotation - induced motions ) which counteract the diffusion process . 
 any model predicting zero stellar depletion in halo field stars must be reconciled with the apparent scatter in the globular cluster turnoff stars . 
 if both the halo stars and the globular cluster stars are depleted by ( say ) mild mixing , it is possible to explain the difference in the abundance patterns by a different set of initial angular momenta . 
 such a difference could arise in the context of the currently popular model for the origin of the range of rotation rates , namely that the lifetime of accretion disks determines the rotation rate , if globular cluster stars experienced more frequent interactions which disrupted their accretion disks early in their lifetimes relative to the lower density systems that the halo stars arose from . 
 it is more challenging , however , to explain why stars with similar thermal structures should experience completely different depletion histories . 
 the _ complete _ absence of depletion in population ii stars would also have to be reconciled with the strong evidence for depletion in population i stars which is not predicted by standard models .    at the same time , it is also clear that none of the existing theoretical models provide a complete description of the complex lithium abundance pattern seen in stars . 
 although the most recent classes of rotational models are reasonably successful at reproducing the observed angular momentum evolution of low mass population i stars , they do not reproduce the solar rotation profile as inferred from helioseismology . 
 they also require an extrapolation of the initial conditions from population i to population ii stars , which may introduce systematic errors in the calculations . 
 further theoretical work is clearly needed , and a more refined set of models could potentially alter the inferred degree of stellar depletion . 
 we have compared theoretical models with the observational population ii lithium data to obtain bounds on stellar lithium depletion . from a combination of the dispersion in the data , 
 the detection of @xmath10 , and the flatness of the halo plateau interesting bounds can be set on the stellar depletion of lithium in population ii stars . 
 the majority of tests are roughly consistent with depletion at the 0.15 - 0.2 dex level , with a firm upper bound of 0.5 - 0.6 dex from a combination of the detected @xmath10 abundance in hd 84937 and an extreme chemical evolution model . 
 the most recent data set of rnb places the most severe observational constraints on the dispersion of lithium in halo stars . 
 it is marginally consistent with the least depleted set of models of pwsn including rotational mixing ; a larger statistical sample would permit a more definitive test of the limits on depletion from mixing in halo stars . 
 there are unexplained differences between the equivalent width measurements of thorburn ( 1994 ) and rnb which need to be understood ; indeed , the systematic differences between investigators on the absolute level of the plateau are approaching the uncertainty in the inferred degree of stellar depletion .    a new generation of theoretical models is needed to further refine our understanding of light element depletion in stars . 
 the interaction between different physical mechanisms , such as microscopic diffusion , mass loss , and rotational mixing , and a better physical description of each of them , may prove important in this context .    finally , any stellar lithium depletion has implications for bbn . 
 pwsn discussed the implications of a higher primordial lithium abundance ; see olive ( these proceedings ) for the case of negligible stellar depletion . if the preliminary data from the boomerang mission is confirmed ( lange et al . 
 2000 ) , we note that there may be a disagreement between the stellar lithium abundances and the predictions of standard bbn as well as the low deuterium results of tytler ( these proceedings . ) 
 this is significantly relaxed if stellar lithium depletion has occured .

18,"since the beginning of the 1970 s , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) has been a basic feature of all realistic theories of elementary particles . 
 it is discussed in every book on quantum field theory , so one might expect the theory of this effect to be well understood . however , until very recently this was not the case . 
 the standard picture of ssb that many people have in mind looks as follows . 
 the field initially stays at the top of the effective potential @xmath8 at @xmath0 like a ball at the top of a hill . 
 then some small external force pushes it to the right or the left . 
 even if this force is infinitesimally small , it is enough for the field to start falling down in the direction in which it was pushed . 
 the field then oscillates near the minimum of its effective potential @xmath8 at @xmath9 , and eventually the whole universe becomes filled by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath9 . as an example of this process one can imagine a piece of ferromagnetic material being magnetized under the influence of a very small external magnetic field . 
 that is why many authors who studied ssb assumed that the field @xmath1 was initially slightly displaced from the maximum of @xmath8 . 
 then they studied classical rolling of the field @xmath1 from this displaced state and the growth of quantum fluctuations on top of the homogeneous classical field . 
 it was generally thought that the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous classical field @xmath1 with amplitude @xmath10 would last for a very long time until it produced elementary particles that drained the energy of the classical oscillations . 
 one can talk about spontaneous symmetry breaking only when the field @xmath1 settles down at @xmath11 and starts oscillating near this state with an amplitude much smaller than @xmath12 : @xmath13 . 
 the most efficient process that was previously known to convert the energy of a homogeneously oscillating scalar field into the energy of elementary particles and make the amplitude of the oscillations small was parametric resonance @xcite , but in most cases studied in the literature the homogeneous component of the field makes several dozen oscillations before the process completes . 
 however , in a recent paper by felder , garca - bellido , greene , kofman , linde and tkachev @xcite it was shown that typically spontaneous symmetry breaking completes within a single oscillation of the scalar field . 
 one key observation made in @xcite was that nobody pushes the field @xmath1 from the top of the effective potential in the early universe , so the usual picture of a homogeneously oscillating scalar field is incorrect in application to ssb . in those cases when the initial value of the homogeneous component of the field @xmath1 is close to zero , quantum fluctuations rather than the classical rolling of the homogeneous field @xmath1 dominate the dynamics . 
 usually ssb occurs because of the presence of tachyonic mass terms such as @xmath14 in the effective potential , so that @xmath15 
 . long wavelength quantum fluctuations @xmath16 of the field @xmath1 with momenta @xmath17 grow exponentially , @xmath18 . 
 when these fluctuations become large they can be interpreted as classical waves of the scalar field . 
 spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the total amplitude of these fluctuations grows up to @xmath12 . because all modes with @xmath19 are growing 
 , ssb occurs _ locally _ on a scale somewhat greater than @xmath20 . 
 later on , this scale gradually increases . 
 inhomogeneities of the scalar field absorb some part of the energy @xmath4 , which suppresses the amplitude of the scalar field oscillations . as a result , the field @xmath1 that appears after ssb is relatively homogeneous on the scale somewhat greater than @xmath20 , and the amplitude of its oscillations @xmath21 about the state @xmath11 is substantially smaller than @xmath12 . 
 thus , contrary to naive expectations , a prolonged stage of oscillations of a homogeneous component of the scalar fields during ssb usually does not exist . 
 as we will show in this paper , one reaches a similar conclusion even if the field @xmath1 initially has been slightly displaced from the top of the potential ( no ssb ) . with this initial condition 
 , the homogeneous background field decays within few oscillations due to the broad parametric resonance enhanced by the tachyonic regime . 
 the process of rapid transfer of the energy of the scalar field @xmath4 into the energy of its inhomogeneous oscillations due to tachyonic instability was called _ tachyonic preheating _ @xcite . 
 one should distinguish between the tachyonic preheating and spinodal ( tachyonic ) instability , which occurs at the very beginning of this process . 
 the first stages of the process of ssb related to tachyonic ( spinodal ) instability can be studied by relatively simple methods . however , very soon the process becomes exceedingly complicated . 
 when the field grows sufficiently large , one should take into account nonlinear effects . 
 oscillations of the field can trigger an explosive process of particle production due to parametric resonance @xcite , which can be especially efficient in our case because of the tachyonic instability . 
 particles ( waves ) of the classical field produced in this process begin interacting with each other ( rescattering ) . at this stage even advanced methods based on the hartree @xcite or @xmath22 @xcite approximations fail to describe the situation correctly . 
 in addition , from the very beginning of the process there may be production of topological defects , which can not be described by perturbation theory . 
 one might expect that since this is a nonperturbative phenomenon it can not materially affect the process of ssb . as we will see , however , the production of topological defects is not a small correction but an important feature of ssb . 
 topological defects , like other inhomogeneities generated by tachyonic instability , drain the energy of the scalar field rolling down to the minimum of the effective potential . by doing so , 
 they diminish the amplitude of subsequent oscillations of the scalar field . 
 there is an extensive literature describing ssb , spinodal instability and the production of topological defects during high temperature phase transitions in cosmology @xcite . to study these issues 
 one should find how the temperature changes in the early universe @xcite and use numerical methods to find out how symmetry breaking occurs in an expanding universe with a time - dependent temperature . 
 many interesting results have been obtained in this direction , see e.g. @xcite . however , most of these results were strongly model - dependent because the answers crucially depend on the ratios between masses of the particles , their coupling constants , the temperature of the universe and the rate of expansion . to avoid this problem , in this paper 
 we will concentrate on the simplest possibility when the temperature was zero from the very beginning and the field was standing on the top of the effective potential . 
 this will allow us to study basic features of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking in its pure form without extra complications related to high temperature effects and cosmological evolution .    even in this regime , 
 the theory of ssb remains extremely complicated since for its investigation one should go beyond perturbation theory . 
 fortunately , during the last few years new methods of lattice simulations have been developed . 
 they are based on the observation that quantum states of bose fields with large occupation numbers can be interpreted as classical waves and their dynamics can be fully analysed by solving relativistic wave equations on a lattice @xcite . 
 similar methods were used in @xcite in application to sphaleron effects , the formation of disoriented chiral condensates , and the problem of topological defect production in the early universe . in our paper , which extends the previous work @xcite , we will further develop these methods . 
 usually the main output of lattice simulations is the calculation of correlation functions , wilson loops , etc . 
 a significant advantage of our methods is that the semi - classical nature of the effects under investigation allows us to have a clear visual picture of all the processes involved . 
 one can really _ see _ the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , which helps enormously in understanding the nature of this effect . 
 that is why this paper is accompanied by many figures that show the development of symmetry breaking in various models . 
 in addition to the simplest models with @xmath23 , we will study some models where the curvature of the effective potential near @xmath0 is negative , but it vanishes at @xmath0 . 
 this happens in such theories as @xmath24 or @xmath25 . 
 ( potentials of the type of @xmath26 appear in the simplest susy motivated models of hybrid inflation . ) 
 as we will see , the development of tachyonic instability in such models is accompanied by bubble formation and growth and bubble wall collisions . rather interestingly , 
 in these theories bubble formation occurs via tunneling even though there is no potential barrier in @xmath8 @xcite . 
 moreover in the theory @xmath26 this process occurs even though there are no instantons describing bubble formation in this theory . to understand this process one should use the stochastic approach to tunneling developed in @xcite . 
 section [ theory ] describes the basic theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking and tachyonic instability , focusing particularly on the simplest example of a negative quadratic potential . in this section 
 we also discuss the definition of occupation number used throughout the paper to describe the growth of fluctuations . 
 section [ displacement ] generalizes the theory to a broader class of potentials and to the case where the homogeneous field begins displaced from the maximum of the potential . 
 section [ quadratic ] presents the results of our numerical simulations for the simplest ssb model , a single field with a quadratic tachyonic term ( i.e. @xmath27 ) . 
 section [ perturbative ] compares our results with results obtained from perturbative calculations and shows how and when the perturbative calculations break down . 
 section [ complexsection ] extends our numerical calculations to the case of a complex field with a quadratic tachyonic term . 
 the next two sections discuss the somewhat more complicated situation that arises when the tachyonic mass is @xmath1 dependent and vanishes at @xmath28 . 
 section [ quarticsection ] discusses quartic potentials ( @xmath29 ) and explains how ssb occurs through tunneling and bubble formation in such models . 
 section [ cubic ] discusses cubic potentials where the behavior is in some ways intermediate between that of the quadratic and quartic cases .    in the concluding section 
 we summarize our results and briefly discuss their application to various cosmological scenarios , including hybrid inflation , new inflation , brane inflation , and the recently proposed ekpyrotic / pyrotechnic universe scenarios . 
 finally there is an appendix that provides details on our lattice calculations and lists the parameters used for each of the simulations described in the paper . 
 the simplest model of spontaneous symmetry breaking is based on the theory with the effective potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 . 
 @xmath8 has a maximum at @xmath0 with curvature @xmath33 and a minimum at @xmath34 . 
 the development of tachyonic instability in this model depends on the initial conditions . 
 we will assume that initially the symmetry is completely restored so that the field @xmath1 does not have any homogeneous component , i.e. @xmath35 . 
 but then @xmath36 remains zero at all later stages and for the investigation of ssb one needs to find the spatial distribution of the field @xmath37 . to avoid this complication 
 , many authors assume that there is a small but finite initial homogeneous background field @xmath38 , and even smaller quantum fluctuations @xmath39 that grow on top of it . 
 this approximation may provide some interesting information , but quite often it is inadequate . in particular , it does not describe the creation of topological defects , which , as we will see , is not a small nonperturbative correction but an important part of the problem . 
 let us consider equation for the scalar field fluctuations in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) : @xmath40 for definiteness , we suppose that the mode functions describing quantum fluctuations in the symmetric phase @xmath28 at the moment close to @xmath41 are the same as for a massless field , @xmath42 
 . then at @xmath41 we ` turn on ' the term @xmath43 corresponding to the negative mass squared @xmath44 . 
 the modes with @xmath45 grow exponentially . 
 initial dispersion of all growing fluctuations with @xmath17 was given by @xmath46 and the average initial amplitude of all fluctuations with @xmath17 was given by @xmath47    the dispersion of the growing modes at @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 this means that the average amplitude @xmath50 of quantum fluctuations with momenta @xmath51 initially was @xmath52 , and then it started growing as @xmath53 . 
 to get a qualitative understanding of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , instead of many growing waves with momenta @xmath54 in ( [ abb ] ) let us consider first a single sinusoidal wave @xmath55 with @xmath56 and with initial amplitude @xmath57 in one - dimensional space ( so that the average value of @xmath58 corresponds to @xmath59 ) . 
 the amplitude of this wave grows exponentially until it becomes @xmath60 . 
 this leads to the division of the universe into domains of size @xmath61 in which the field changes from @xmath62 to @xmath63 . 
 the gradient energy density of domain walls separating areas with positive and negative @xmath1 will be @xmath64 . 
 this energy is of the same order as the total initial potential energy of the field @xmath65 . 
 this is one of the reasons why any approximation based on perturbation theory and ignoring topological defect production can not give a correct description of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking . 
 thus a substantial part of the energy @xmath4 is transferred to the gradient energy of the field @xmath1 when it rolls down to the minimum of @xmath8 . because the initial state contains many quantum fluctuations with different phases growing at different rates , 
 the resulting field distribution is a gaussian random field with varying spectrum . 
 it can not coherently give all of its gradient energy back and return to its initial state @xmath0 . 
 this is one of the reasons why spontaneous symmetry breaking and the main stage of preheating in this model may occur within a single oscillation of the field  @xmath1 . 
 meanwhile if one were to make the usual assumption that initially there exists a small homogeneous background field @xmath66 with an amplitude greater than the amplitude of the growing quantum fluctuations @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 , one would find out that when @xmath1 falls to the minimum of the effective potential the gradient energy of the fluctuations remains relatively small . in some situations this could lead one to falsely conclude that the field will experience many fluctuations before it relaxes near the minimum of @xmath8 . to avoid this error 
 , we need to perform a complete study of the growth of all tachyonic modes and their subsequent interaction without making this simplifying assumption about the existence of a homogeneous field @xmath1 . 
 the tachyonic growth of all fluctuations with @xmath54 continues until @xmath69 reaches the value @xmath70 , since at @xmath71 the curvature of the effective potential vanishes and instead of tachyonic growth one has the usual oscillations of all the modes . 
 ( [ abb ] ) shows that this happens within a time @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .    a convenient tool for studying this process is the spectrum of the growing quantum fluctuations . rather than using the usual power spectrum @xmath74 , however , we find it more informative to investigate the occupation number @xmath75 of produced particles @xcite . indeed , in situations where the number of particles is well defined ( and this always happens at the end of the process ) the occupation number @xmath75 is an adiabatic invariant , i.e. it does not change during the field oscillations unless some dramatic changes occur to the system . 
 the standard definition of the occupation number which was extensively used in the theory of preheating @xcite , and which is valid for @xmath76 , is @xmath77 however , this definition does not work in the tachyonic regime when the effective mass squared of the field @xmath1 becomes negative since then @xmath78 becomes imaginary . 
 strictly speaking , @xmath75 should not be interpreted as the occupation number of particles during the tachyonic regime . 
 one may still formally calculate the function @xmath75 in this regime using either @xmath79 or @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 in the expression for @xmath75 whenever @xmath82 . 
 the choice between @xmath79 and @xmath80 is arbitrary , and it does not change any of the final physical results . 
 the spectra shown in this paper used @xmath83 in the tachyonic regime , with the exception of fig . 1 and fig 
 . 2 , where we used @xmath84 . 
 the formally defined quantity @xmath75 can be interpreted as the occupation number of particles after the end of the tachyonic regime , when @xmath76 . moreover , for all nonvanishing momenta these two quantities match very well when one switches from the tachyonic regime to the normal one . indeed , whereas the value of @xmath85 changes during the process , the exponential growth of @xmath75 is mainly determined by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which do not change strongly during the switch between the tachyonic regime and the normal one . 
 therefore the function @xmath75 is very convenient and informative during the whole process . 
 when one calculates @xmath75 during the tachyonic regime , one can get a good idea of the number of particles that will emerge at the end of this regime where the usual particle interpretation becomes possible . in this sense 
 we will interpret the function @xmath75 defined above as the occupation number of particles in both regimes . 
 an additional caveat of this interpretation is that when one calculates @xmath16 , one does not distinguish between the contribution to this quantity from small perturbations and from topological defects . as a result , in the presence of topological defects one can somewhat overestimate the number of produced particles . 
 the error , however , is not very large , especially in theories where instead of domain walls we have strings or monopoles . 
 moreover , eventually topological defects disappear and release their energy in the form of produced particles , and the standard interpretation of @xmath75 becomes completely valid . 
 the exponential growth of fluctuations during the tachyonic regime can be interpreted as the growth of the occupation number of particles with @xmath88 . using the estimates given above 
 , one can show that @xmath75 for @xmath88 at the time @xmath89 grows up to @xmath90 the time @xmath72 depends only logarithmically not only on @xmath91 , but , more generally , on the choice of the initial distribution of quantum fluctuations . as we see , for small @xmath91 the fluctuations with @xmath88 acquire very large occupation numbers . 
 more importantly , such fluctuations will have large amplitude and will be in squeezed state . the general solution for these fluctuations will contain two terms , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but after a short time only the growing mode @xmath92 survives . 
 therefore , independently of the initial phases of quantum fluctuations , the only modes with @xmath17 that survive after the beginning of the tachyonic regime will coherently grow , and their amplitude will become extremely large . 
 that is why these modes can be interpreted as classical waves and can be studied by computer simulations using the methods of @xcite . 
 the dominant contribution to @xmath94 in eq . 
 ( [ abb ] ) at the moment @xmath89 is given by the modes with wavelength @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . 
 as a result , at the moment when the fluctuations of the field @xmath1 reach the minimum of the effective potential , @xmath97 , the field distribution looks rather homogeneous on a scale @xmath98 . on average , 
 one still has @xmath99 . 
 this implies that the universe becomes divided into domains with two different types of spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath100 . 
 the typical size of each domain is @xmath101 , which is slightly greater than @xmath20 . at later stages the domains 
 grow in size and percolate ( eat each other ) , and ssb becomes established on a macroscopic scale . 
 of course , these are just simple estimates that should be followed by a detailed quantitative investigation . 
 when the field rolls down to the minimum of its effective potential its fluctuations scatter off each other as classical waves due to the @xmath102 interaction . 
 it is difficult to study this process analytically , but fortunately one can do it numerically using the method of lattice simulations developed in @xcite .    before describing the results of our lattice simulations 
 , we would like to discuss the setting of the problem , the choice of the initial conditions and some other aspects of tachyonic instability in a more general class of theories , including the theories with @xmath103 . 
 as we already emphasized , spontaneous symmetry breaking usually occurs due to quantum fluctuations when the field @xmath1 falls from an exactly symmetric state @xmath0 
 . however , it is still very instructive to find out what happens when the field falls down from some state with @xmath104 . by doing this 
 , we will get an additional insight in the nature of tachyonic instability 
 . we will also be able to compare our results with the results of earlier works on spontaneous symmetry breaking . 
 consider the behavior of the fluctuations @xmath105 with momentum @xmath88 . 
 an important observation is that these fluctuations satisfy the same equation of motion as @xmath106 : @xmath107 a general solution of this equation for @xmath108 is @xmath109 . 
 similarly , for @xmath110 one has @xmath111 . 
 at @xmath112 only the growing mode survives , and the ratio @xmath113 becomes constant . 
 this rule holds for other types of tachyonic potentials as well . 
 thus one can investigate the amplification of the long wavelength perturbations of the scalar field @xmath1 in a very easy way . instead of solving equations for @xmath114 in a time - dependent background @xmath38 
 , one can find how @xmath115 changes in time . 
 we will use this trick here and in the next section . 
 consider the theory @xmath116 suppose the field @xmath1 begins rolling down from @xmath117 . 
 energy conservation implies that @xmath118 we will assume for simplicity that in the beginning , at @xmath119 , the field moves with the same velocity as if it were falling with vanishing total energy from @xmath28 ( this assumption does not make any difference for motion at @xmath120 ) . 
 then one has @xmath121 thus @xmath122 the solution is @xmath123 the most important result is eq . 
 ( [ rrr ] ) . in a more general case of nonvanishing total energy 
 we have @xmath124 where @xmath117 is an initial field value where @xmath125 . 
 it implies that the tachyonic fluctuations with small momenta in the long time limit ( @xmath126 ) grow as follows : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is some constant . 
 this means , in particular , that in the theory with the potential @xmath129 the long wavelength fluctuations grow just like the field itself , @xmath130 . 
 meanwhile for the theory with @xmath131 the fluctuations grow faster , @xmath132 , and for the theory @xmath133 they grow even faster , @xmath134 .    returning to the theory @xmath135 
 , we find that the potential is tachyonic ( @xmath136 ) for @xmath137 , and it can be approximately represented as @xmath138 for @xmath139 . 
 when the field @xmath1 grows from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , the speed of the field @xmath106 grows from @xmath142 to @xmath143 . 
 consequently , the amplitude of density perturbations grows by a factor @xmath144 , and the occupation numbers @xmath75 of particles for @xmath88 grow by a factor @xmath145 .    clearly , one has the largest amplification if one starts as close to @xmath146 as possible . 
 however , if @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the average amplitude of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations with momentum @xmath17 ( which grow almost as fast as the homogeneous mode ) , then the development of @xmath117 gives no information on the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this case instead of @xmath117 one would need to study all growing modes with @xmath17 , just as in the case @xmath146 . 
 this is what we are doing in the main part of this paper 
 .    equation for fluctuations in the model @xmath149 is @xmath150 this equation should be solved simultaneously with the equation for the background field @xmath38 @xmath151 equation ( [ fluc ] ) is the lame equation @xcite . 
 its solutions depend on the dimensionless parameters @xmath152 . in the context of the chaotic inflationary model , where the field @xmath38 is rolling from its large initial value @xmath153 , this parameter usually was taken to be large @xcite . in the context of the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking we are dealing with the opposite case when @xmath117 is close to zero 
 the description of the growth of perturbations in the model @xmath154 is a straightforward generalization of the theory of parametric resonance in the model @xmath155 , which has been studied using the stability / instability chart of the lame equation @xcite . 
 the presence of the negative mass term adds an additional instability band at @xmath156 . 
 the characteristic exponent @xmath157 in this new zone is significantly greater that in the higher zones because of the tachyonic effect . 
 thus , the tachyonic parametric resonance will be dominant . 
 when the field rolls towards the minimum of @xmath8 , the occupation numbers @xmath75 , calculated from the solutions @xmath114 of equation ( [ fluc ] ) , become large . however , for @xmath158 the field fluctuations do not grow large enough to dominate the energy density immediately after the rolling to the minimum of the effective potential . to find out what happens in this case , 
 we will describe , as an example , the evolution of the occupation numbers of the modes @xmath16 with different momenta @xmath159 in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) with @xmath160 if the field rolls from @xmath161 ( which is larger than @xmath148 in this model ) . 
 consider first a mode @xmath16 with @xmath88 . in the beginning , when the field @xmath1 rolls from @xmath119 to @xmath162 , this mode grows faster than any other fluctuations , just as we expected , see fig . 
 [ k=0 ] . during this time interval , 
 the occupation number becomes @xmath163 , which is in good agreement with our estimate @xmath164 . 
 then the field reaches the bottom of the effective potential , goes somewhat beyond this point , bounces back , and again approaches the tachyonic region @xmath165 . 
 until the field becomes smaller than @xmath141 , the occupation number of particles with @xmath88 does not change much . 
 but then it _ decreases _ almost to the same value from which we started our calculations . 
 what happens is that the solution for the fluctuations has two modes , the growing one and the decaying one . 
 when the field bounces , fluctuations either grow or decay depending on the phase with which they re - enter the tachyonic regime . 
 therefore even though the modes with @xmath88 grow fast on the way down , they also decay fast on the way up , as shown in fig . 
 [ k=0 ] . 
 meanwhile for the modes in a rather broad interval of @xmath159 , from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , the modes continue their growth when the field oscillates . 
 figure [ k=05 ] shows the growth of @xmath75 during three consecutive oscillations of the field @xmath1 . as we see , during each full oscillation the occupation numbers grow @xmath168 times . 
 thus during @xmath169 oscillations the occupation numbers should grow @xmath170 times . 
 this is an incredibly fast growth . 
 it occurs much faster than the usual parametric resonance in theories with @xmath171 @xcite . 
 clearly , this process can rapidly convert all the energy of the homogeneous field into the energy of classical colliding waves , and at this stage the only reliable way to study the process is to use numerical simulations .    in the theory @xmath172 the fluctuations grow as fast as the scalar field , so if one begins with a homogeneous field with @xmath173 , then on the way down to @xmath174 this field distribution remains relatively homogeneous . 
 however , when the field rolls back towards @xmath119 , the inhomogeneities with @xmath175 continue growing . 
 for example , if one takes @xmath176 , quantum fluctuations ( which have initial amplitude only one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath117 in this model ) grow almost @xmath177 times when the field @xmath1 falls down from @xmath119 and returns back . 
 the amplitude of inhomogeneities after the return becomes approximately three orders of magnitude larger than @xmath117 , which means that the homogeneity becomes completely destroyed . at this stage ( and in fact much earlier ) one can no longer study the evolution of quantum fluctuations as if they were small deviations on a homogeneous background . 
 when the field falls down to the minimum of the effective potential again , it becomes divided into large colliding waves . 
 one can not study the evolution of such a system using perturbation theory .    in the theories @xmath178 with @xmath7 
 the situation may be even more interesting and the growth of the occupation number @xmath75 for small @xmath159 occurs even faster . 
 for example , in the theory @xmath24 long wavelength fluctuations grow as @xmath179 ( and the occupation numbers grow as @xmath180 ) . 
 therefore when the field @xmath1 grows from @xmath117 to @xmath12 , the ratio @xmath181 grows by a factor of @xmath182 . 
 this means that the field may become very inhomogeneous on its way down even if initially it was very homogeneous . 
 the average initial amplitude of tachyonic fluctuations in the theory @xmath183 at @xmath104 is given by @xmath184 . 
 initial level of inhomogeneities was given by @xmath185 . 
 when the field @xmath1 reaches some value @xmath186 , the ratio @xmath187 grows and becomes @xmath188 . 
 thus , if the rolling of the field begins at a very small value of the field @xmath117 , or if it continues long enough , so that @xmath189 becomes greater than @xmath190 , the field becomes completely inhomogeneous on its way down . 
 moreover , if one considers a theory such as e.g. @xmath191 , which has a minimum at @xmath3 , then in such theories , just as in the theory @xmath172 , there are some modes with @xmath192 whose amplitude grows both on the way down and on the way up . for these modes 
 the degree of inhomogeneity rapidly grow with each oscillation . 
 the occupation numbers grow approximately as @xmath193 during each full oscillation , so that after @xmath169 oscillations the occupation numbers of the particles with momenta @xmath194 become as large as @xmath195 . 
 that is why it takes only one or two oscillations before the oscillating scalar field becomes inhomogeneous and the first stage of preheating related to the tachyonic instability completes . 
 the simple rules derived above explain the extraordinary efficiency of tachyonic preheating . 
 however , one can apply these rules only at the beginning of the process , when one can neglect the backreaction of created particles . 
 that is why we needed to perform computer simulations which took the effects of backreaction into account . 
 a description of our method @xcite in application to this problem is given in the appendix . 
 there are several complementary ways one can represent the results of our calculations . 
 one of the best ways to do it is to study the probability distribution function @xmath197 , which is the fraction of the volume containing the field @xmath1 at a time @xmath198 . at @xmath41 
 we begin with the probability distribution concentrated near @xmath0 , with the quantum mechanical dispersion ( [ abb ] ) , and then we follow its evolution ; see fig . 
 [ onefielddistrib ] .    in the beginning quantum fluctuations 
 are very small , and the probability distribution @xmath197 is very narrowly focused near @xmath0 
 . then it spreads out and shows two maxima that oscillate about @xmath34 with an amplitude much smaller than @xmath12 .    as we see from fig . 
 [ onefielddistrib ] , the two maxima never come close to the initial point @xmath0 , which implies that symmetry becomes broken within a single oscillation of the distribution of the field @xmath1 . to demonstrate that this is not a strong coupling effect 
 , we show the results for the model ( [ ab1 ] ) with @xmath160 . 
 we obtained similar results for @xmath199 . 
 note that only when the distribution stabilizes and the domains become large can one use the standard language of perturbation theory describing scalar particles as excitations on a ( locally ) homogeneous background . 
 that is why the use of the nonperturbative approach based on lattice simulations was so important for our investigation . 
 one may wonder why the distribution is slightly asymmetric , and why after symmetry breaking there are still many points at @xmath200 . 
 the answer is that after ssb space becomes divided into domains with @xmath201 . 
 domains are large , and their size gradually grows after ssb because large domains `` eat '' the small ones . eventually in any finite size box there will remain just one domain , i.e. the distribution will become completely asymmetric . the points with @xmath200 correspond to domain walls .    in this series of simulations we made a cut - off in the spectrum of initial fluctuations at @xmath202 . 
 the reason is that only the modes with @xmath17 from the very beginning experience exponential growth and behave as classical fields . 
 we checked , however , that the results of the simulations remain qualitatively the same if one makes a cut - off at @xmath203 . 
 the process of thermalization takes much longer than spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite . 
 indeed , the standard thermal distribution is given by the well known equation @xmath204 . at the moment when all the energy @xmath205 is transferred to the thermal energy @xmath206 , the temperature rises up to @xmath207 , and the occupation numbers at @xmath156 become @xmath208 . 
 in particular , for @xmath209 one would have @xmath210 , which is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the results of our calculations . 
 thus , the occupation numbers should drop down dramatically before full thermalization is achieved . 
 this may happen only if the total number of particles becomes many orders of magnitude smaller ( particle cannibalism ) . 
 if one considers only those interactions that preserve the total number of particles ( scattering @xmath211 ) , one may achieve a kind of temporary thermal equilibrium with a nonvanishing effective chemical potential of particles @xmath1 . 
 this is what we see in our calculations when the occupation numbers gradually approach some quasi - equilibrium asymptotic limit . 
 since there is no real particle conservation in this theory , eventually the effective chemical potential will vanish , and the true thermal equilibrium with @xmath212 will be reached . but this process takes much greater time than the time required for spontaneous symmetry breaking .    to provide a visual picture of the distribution of the scalar field , we show the growth of fluctuations in a two - dimensional slice of 3d space in this model in fig . 
 [ onefieldslice ] . 
 maxima correspond to domains with @xmath213 ; minima correspond to domains with @xmath214 . 
 the third image corresponds to the first one half of an oscillation , just like the third panel in fig . 
 [ onefielddistrib ] . as we see the universe at that moment 
 is already divided into domains with @xmath201 . 
 the initial size of each domain is somewhat greater than @xmath20 . inside each domain 
 the deviation from @xmath215 is much smaller than @xmath12 . 
 this confirms our conclusion that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs within a single oscillation . 
 = 21.5 cm    the original domain structure can change within a time @xmath216 because of domain wall collisions and domain expansion . 
 gradually , the size of each domain grows and the domain wall structure becomes more and more stable , as we see in the last two images of fig . 
 [ onefieldslice ] . 
 if one continues the calculation for a much longer time , one can see much more clearly the formation and growth of domains with @xmath34 . in the beginning 
 these domains are small , but then they `` eat '' each other and grow . to illustrate this process we performed simulations in a 2d box of size 1024 x 1024 
 . this allowed us to perform the calculations out to a much greater time and see domain formation on a much greater scale ; see fig . 
 [ domains ] . 
 one should note that the process of rescattering of particles produced during preheating in 2d is somewhat different from that in 3d . 
 however , the tachyonic instability is the same in both cases and the process of domain growth is qualitatively similar . 
 before going any further , let us discuss the difference between our methods and the usual approach based on perturbation theory . in the usual approach 
 one solves a self - consistent system of equations for the homogeneous scalar field @xmath1 and for the variance @xmath217 , where @xmath217 is generated due to particle production by the oscillating field @xmath1 , see e.g. @xcite .    in this approach 
 one would expect that the effective mass of the field @xmath1 is given by @xmath218 . 
 this is the standard approach used , in particular , in the theory of the high temperature cosmological phase transitions @xcite . 
 let us see what would happen if we naively applied this method to our problem . 
 our investigation shows that within a single oscillation the variance of the scalar field grows to @xmath219 ; see fig . 
 [ onefielddistrib ] . 
 a more detailed investigation shows that soon after the beginning of the process the value of @xmath217 is not much different from @xmath220 . 
 this would seem to imply that immediately after spontaneous symmetry breaking the symmetry becomes restored again , because the effective mass squared of the field @xmath1 becomes positive : @xmath221 . 
 however , our numerical calculations clearly demonstrate that this is not the case . 
 so what is wrong with the standard perturbative approach ? 
 the point is that in order to investigate the tachyonic instability one should study the local field distribution on a scale comparable to @xmath20 instead of the field distribution averaged over the whole universe . in our scenario the universe becomes divided into different domains of size greater than @xmath222 . if one wants to study the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , then instead of finding the average values @xmath223 and @xmath217 over the whole universe one should find the average value of @xmath1 inside each domain . 
 after that , one should calculate the variance @xmath217 , where @xmath67 is the _ local _ deviation of the field @xmath1 from its average value inside each domain . 
 but even this will give only partial information about the process . 
 that is why in addition to finding the probability distribution and the occupation numbers ( fig . 
 [ onefielddistrib ] ) , we have shown the spatial distribution of the field @xmath1 ( fig . [ onefieldslice ] ) . 
 this need for local averaging is an important issue that was overlooked in many recent works on preheating , as well as in some works on the backreaction of long wavelength inflationary quantum fluctuations on the speed of expansion and the average energy - momentum tensor of matter . 
 we are not saying that the calculation of averages such as @xmath223 and @xmath217 over the whole universe is not useful . 
 for example , it is quite informative in the theory of high temperature phase transitions , where the typical contribution to @xmath217 occurs due to the short wavelength fluctuations with the wavelength @xmath224 , which is much smaller than @xmath20 at the time of the phase transition @xcite . 
 however , one should be extremely careful using averages like @xmath217 over the whole universe in situations where a substantial contribution to @xmath217 is given by fluctuations whose wavelength is greater than the typical length scale of the problem . 
 it does not matter how accurately one calculates such averages , whether one works in the hartree approximation or in the @xmath22 approximation , as in @xcite . in the case 
 described above we calculated @xmath217 very accurately using our lattice simulations . 
 this method takes into account not only the usual backreaction effects that could be studied in the hartree or @xmath22 approximations , but also effects of rescattering of produced particles . 
 still we have seen that a naive use of our results would lead to an incorrect conclusion that symmetry becomes restored immediately after it breaks down . 
 if one has to use perturbation theory in situations when the infrared contribution to @xmath217 is substantial , the occupation numbers are large and the results allow a semi - classical interpretation , one can avoid the problem discussed above if one rearranges perturbation theory in a nontrivial way . 
 for example , if one studies effects on a length scale @xmath225 , one may consider all fluctuations on larger scales as a nearly homogeneous classical field background and ignore the contribution of these fluctuations to @xmath217 . in the context of the theory of preheating , 
 this issue was discussed in section x of ref . 
 @xcite . in inflationary cosmology a similar approximation constitutes the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation @xcite . 
 an alternative method is to use numerical simulations that can bring us more detailed information about the process . 
 this is the method we use in our paper .    to compare our method with the more traditional perturbative approach assuming initial displacement of the field @xmath104 , we performed a series of simulations for different values of @xmath117 exceeding the level of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations @xmath226 . 
 for @xmath227 the results did not differ much from the results that we obtained for @xmath146 in the previous section . 
 the distribution of the field @xmath1 never returned back to the vicinity of @xmath0 , and the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred within a single oscillation . 
 note , that our calculations were performed for @xmath209 , so that @xmath228 .    for a much greater initial displacement 
 the results were somewhat different , but still for @xmath140 we have found that the regime of homogeneous oscillations completely disappeared after a couple of oscillations . 
 consider , for example , the case @xmath229 ; see fig . 
 [ onefielddistribdispl ] . 
 as one might expect , in this case the final probability distribution is entirely concentrated at @xmath230 , and one can check that no topological defects are produced at the end of the process . 
 but even in this case we have found that the process completes very fast , after the second oscillation . 
 this result differs from the results of investigation of the same model in @xcite , where it was claimed that the oscillations of the homogeneous component of the field in this model continue for a long time with the amplitude comparable to @xmath12 , even if one starts with @xmath231 . 
 the reason for the disagreement is very simple . 
 first of all , in the investigation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the theory @xmath232 in @xcite the initial displacement of the field @xmath117 was chosen two orders of magnitude smaller than the level of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations with @xmath17 , @xmath233 . in this case 
 ssb appears not because of the growth of the homogeneous component of the field , but because of the generation of fluctuations with @xmath17 . in such a situation investigation of the homogeneous component of the field 
 does not give much information about spontaneous symmetry breaking . 
 moreover , as soon as the combined amplitude of all fluctuations with @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath234 ) becomes comparable to @xmath12 , which happens much earlier than the homogeneous component of the field reaches the minimum of the effective potential , the universe becomes divided into domains with colliding walls . at this moment 
 the standard perturbative approach completely breaks down . 
 it does not describe rescattering of produced particles , collisions of classical waves of the scalar field , and dynamics of topological defects . in this regime equations describing the evolution of the homogeneous component of the field @xmath1 derived in the hartree approximation ( or in 1/n approximation ) become inapplicable . 
 that is why in our work we studied ssb using a combination of analytical investigation and lattice simulations . 
 in the previous section we studied symmetry breaking in a theory ( [ ab1 ] ) describing a one - component real field @xmath1 . one can perform a similar investigation for the theory of a multi - component scalar field @xmath235 with the potential ( [ ab1 ] ) , simply replacing @xmath179 with @xmath236 . 
 figure [ complex ] illustrates the dynamics of symmetry breaking in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) with a two - component scalar field @xmath237 . 
 it shows the probability distribution @xmath238 , which is the fraction of the volume containing the field @xmath1 at a time @xmath198 .    in the beginning 
 , the probability distribution is concentrated near @xmath0 , with the quantum mechanical dispersion ( [ abb ] ) . 
 then the probability distribution spreads out , and after a single oscillation it stabilizes at @xmath239 , which corresponds to ssb . 
 the standard approximation representing the scalar field as a homogeneous background field with small fluctuations does not work at any stage of the process . 
 a detailed investigation of the spatial distribution of the field @xmath1 shows @xcite that after the first oscillation the scalar field can be represented as a collection of classical waves oscillating near @xmath239 with an amplitude smaller than @xmath240 . 
 thus ssb indeed occurs within a single oscillation of the field distribution . a small but nonvanishing height of the histogram in fig . 
 [ complex ] at @xmath0 is due to the presence of strings that have @xmath0 at their cores .    fig . 
 [ compocc ] shows the occupation numbers @xmath75 of produced particles . during the first oscillation 
 these numbers grow up to @xmath241 
 @xmath242 for @xmath17 ( @xmath243 in the figure ) . 
 then the occupation numbers at @xmath17 slightly decrease , whereas the occupation numbers at @xmath202 begin to grow . 
 complete thermalization takes a very long time .    in the model of a complex scalar field , instead of 
 domain walls one has strings that are produced when the field falls down ; see fig . 
 [ strings ] . 
 the whole process of string formation occurs within a single oscillation . 
 after that the new long strings are not formed . sometimes small string loops appear and disappear because of occasional large fluctuations of the scalar field . 
 if symmetry were broken and then restored again when the field distribution moves back to @xmath0 , we would see strings being `` melted , '' and then a completely new set of strings would appear . 
 meanwhile , our simulations show that the large scale string distribution is formed as the field @xmath1 first rolls down to the minimum of the effective potential . during the subsequent oscillations the strings formed in the beginning of the process 
 do not disappear and are not replaced by new ones ; instead they experience only gradual evolution . 
 this confirms our conclusion that symmetry breaking is achieved within a single oscillation . 
 just as in the case of the one - component scalar field , perturbative methods of investigation of this theory can not describe formation of topological defects and scattering of classical waves produced by the tachyonic instability . 
 therefore such methods break down within the first oscillation of the field distribution . 
 the process of ssb will occur in a somewhat different way in theories where the curvature of the effective potential near its maximum depends on @xmath1 . 
 for example , one may consider the coleman - weinberg model , which was the basis for the first version of the new inflation scenario @xcite : @xmath244 this potential has a maximum at @xmath0 and a minimum at @xmath3 . at small @xmath1 
 the effective potential looks like @xmath245 with an effective coupling constant @xmath246 . 
 another interesting example is the toy model @xmath247    an important feature of such potentials is that the tachyonic mass @xmath248 vanishes at @xmath0 . 
 therefore the simple arguments based on the tachyonic growth of small quantum fluctuations do not apply here . 
 the decay of the symmetric phase in such models occurs via tunneling and the formation of bubbles . 
 historically , this was the first example of a theory where tunneling occurs between two states ( @xmath0 and @xmath249 ) even though there is no barrier separating these states @xcite ; see also @xcite .    to study symmetry breaking in these models one should first consider the growth of the field @xmath1 in the model @xmath250 and then see what happens when one adds extra terms that stabilize the potential . 
 the tunneling trajectories ( instantons ) with minimal action possess the @xmath251 symmetry of euclidean space @xcite . 
 the euclidean equation for o(4 ) symmetric tunneling is @xmath252 with the boundary conditions @xmath253 and @xmath254 . 
 here @xmath255 , @xmath256 ; the @xmath257 are the euclidean coordinates , i = 1,2,3,4 . 
 equation ( [ 2 ] ) in the theory ( [ quartic ] ) has a family of solutions @xcite @xmath258 where @xmath259 is arbitrary . 
 note that the value of the scalar field in the center of the bubble depends on @xmath259 : @xmath260 the corresponding euclidean action does not depend on @xmath259 , @xmath261 the probability of bubble formation per unit four - volume can be estimated by the expression @xmath262    the probability of tunneling in the coleman - weinberg theory ( [ cw ] ) can be estimated by this equation if instead of @xmath91 one uses the effective coupling constant @xmath263 . 
 tunneling is not strongly suppressed at @xmath264 . 
 this means that tunneling occurs to a point with exponentially small @xmath1 :  @xmath265 , with @xmath266 .    on the other hand , in the model ( [ cw2 ] ) the effective coupling constant @xmath91 and the factor @xmath267 suppressing the tunneling 
 do not depend on @xmath1 , whereas the subexponential factor in the expression for the tunneling probability ( [ 5 ] ) is greater for large @xmath1 . 
 thus in this model tunneling may occur to relatively large @xmath1 . 
 the bubbles that appear after the tunneling are described by eq . 
 ( [ 3 ] ) if one understands by @xmath268 its minkowski counterpart @xmath269 : @xmath270 such bubbles have symmetry @xmath271 . 
 when the bubble appears ( at @xmath41 ) , the field takes its maximal value @xmath117 at the center of the bubble , @xmath272 . 
 then it grows , and becomes infinitely large at @xmath273 . here 
 @xmath274 .    of course , 
 in realistic models like ( [ cw ] ) and ( [ cw2 ] ) the field does not grow indefinitely large . 
 it reaches the minimum of the effective potential at @xmath34 and then it begins oscillating there . 
 meanwhile quantum fluctuations may grow on top of the smooth instanton solution . 
 the investigation of these oscillations and bubble wall collisions is a complicated problem that can be studied numerically . 
 fortunately , the behavior of the oscillating field prior to the bubble wall collisions and neglecting quantum fluctuations can be studied analytically by making a certain change of variables . 
 indeed , it is known that in properly chosen coordinates the interior of each bubble looks like an open universe filled by a _ homogeneous _ scalar field 
 @xmath1 @xcite . 
 one can show that during the main part of the first oscillation of the field the radius of curvature ( scale factor ) of this open universe is @xmath275 , which leads to expansion of the open universe with hubble constant @xmath276 . 
 this introduces the damping term @xmath277 to the equation of motion of the scalar field , which gradually diminishes the amplitude of its oscillations . 
 suppose that the tunneling occurs to @xmath140 , as in the coleman - weinberg model . 
 then during the main part of the first oscillation the effective mass of the field @xmath1 remains much greater than @xmath278 , so in the limit @xmath279 one can neglect the effect of expansion of the open universe on the amplitude of the oscillations . 
 later on , the hubble constant in the open universe bubble becomes even smaller and its damping effect on the oscillations becomes even less significant . as a result , the amplitude of oscillations of a homogeneous scalar field for a long time remains almost unchanged .    from the point of view of an outside observer using the usual coordinates @xmath280 and @xmath198 this means that the field @xmath1 in the center of the bubble oscillates for a long time with amplitude @xmath2 , sending spherical waves of the same amplitude in all directions . 
 the amplitude of each wave is a function of @xmath281 , which means that they propagate with a speed asymptotically approaching the speed of light and their amplitude does not depend on their distance from the center of the bubble . 
 thus instead of the naive picture of a bubble consisting of a single spherically symmetric shell ( which would be a correct picture in the thin - wall approximation ) , one has a series of waves of almost equal amplitude following each other ; see fig . 
 [ instjpeg ] . reheating in this model 
 occurs due to a combination of different effects . 
 first of all , particles are produced during the collision of waves produced by different tunneling events . 
 but they are also produced due to the tachyonic instability , as well as by the oscillations of the scalar field inside each bubble . 
 = 10.5 cm    we should make some comments here . 
 first of all , if the tunneling occurs to very small values of @xmath1 , quantum fluctuations produced due to tachyonic instability inside the @xmath271 symmetric bubble may completely distort the shape of the bubble during the field oscillations . 
 within few oscillations , tachyonic preheating creates colliding waves inside the bubble ; see fig . 
 [ instjpeg2 ] . 
 note that each tunneling event produces an exponentially large sphere filled either by a positive field @xmath1 oscillating around @xmath3 with a slowly decreasing amplitude , or by a negative field @xmath1 , oscillating around @xmath282 . in both cases 
 ssb occurs within a single oscillation within each bubble , and then finally the field @xmath1 relaxes near @xmath283 due to a combined effect of the amplitude decrease because of the bubble expansion , and the development of tachyonic preheating , as in fig . 
 [ instjpeg2 ] . 
 finally , we should say that if the tunneling occurs to extremely small values of @xmath1 , or if it does not occur for a long time , one may obtain an inflationary regime @xcite . 
 tachyonic preheating in this regime will be discussed in a subsequent publication @xcite . 
 another important example of tachyonic preheating is provided by the theory @xmath284 this potential is a prototype of the potential that appears in descriptions of symmetry breaking in f - term hybrid inflation @xcite . 
 the development of instability in this theory presents us with a new challenge . 
 the curvature of the effective potential at @xmath0 in this theory vanishes , which means that , unlike in the theory @xmath172 ( [ ab1 ] ) , infinitesimally small perturbations in this theory do not grow . on the other hand , unlike in the theory @xmath24 ( [ quartic ] ) , there are no instantons in this theory that would describe tunneling from @xmath0 . 
 thus , in the theory @xmath285 , which occupies an intermediate position between @xmath172 and @xmath24 , both mechanisms that could lead to the development of instability do not work . 
 does this mean that the state @xmath0 in this theory is , in fact , stable ? 
 the answer to this question is no ; the state @xmath0 in the theory @xmath285 is unstable . indeed , even though @xmath286 initially is zero , long wavelength fluctuations of the field @xmath1 are present , and they may play the same role as the homogeneous field @xmath1 in triggering the instability . 
 ( [ abb ] ) implies that scalar field fluctuations with momenta @xmath287 have initial amplitude @xmath288 . 
 thus the short wavelength fluctuations with momenta @xmath289 live on top of a long wavelength field with an average amplitude @xmath290 . 
 the curvature of the effective potential @xmath291 at @xmath292 in the theory ( [ cub ] ) is given by @xmath293 . 
 consider fluctuations with momentum @xmath159 somewhat greater than @xmath294 , so that the amplitude of the long wavelength field @xmath67 does not change significantly on a scale @xmath295 . 
 short wavelength fluctuations with @xmath296 with @xmath128 somewhat greater than @xmath297 will grow on top of the field @xmath298 if @xmath299 . 
 taking for definiteness @xmath300 , one may argue that fluctuations with @xmath301 may enter a self - sustained regime of tachyonic growth . 
 small fluctuations rapidly grow large , which justifies using semi - classical methods for the description of this process . 
 the average initial amplitude of the growing tachyonic fluctuations with momenta smaller than @xmath302 is @xmath303 these fluctuations grow until the amplitude of @xmath67 becomes comparable to @xmath304 , and the effective tachyonic mass vanishes . at that moment 
 the field can be represented as a collection of waves with dispersion @xmath305 , corresponding to coherent states of scalar particles with occupation numbers @xmath306    a more accurate investigation shows that the initial value of the field is few times greater than @xmath307 ( see below ) , and therefore the occupation numbers will be somewhat smaller , @xmath308    because of the nonlinear dependence of the tachyonic mass on @xmath1 , a detailed description of this process is more involved than in the theory ( [ ab1 ] ) . 
 indeed , even though the typical amplitude of the growing fluctuations is given by ( [ typical ] ) , the speed of the growth of the fluctuations increases considerably if the initial amplitude is somewhat bigger than ( [ typical ] ) . 
 thus even though fluctuations with an amplitude a few times greater than ( [ typical ] ) are exponentially suppressed , they grow faster and may therefore have a greater impact on the process than fluctuations with amplitude ( [ typical ] ) . 
 low probability fluctuations with @xmath309 correspond to peaks of the initial gaussian distribution of the fluctuations of the field @xmath1 . 
 the theory of the 3d random gaussian fields is well developed @xcite . 
 its statistical properties are determined by the spectrum @xmath310 . 
 one of the most interesting features of the gaussian field is statistics and the shapes of the high peaks of the field distribution . 
 such peaks tend to be spherically symmetric . as a result 
 , the whole process looks not like a uniform growth of all modes , but more like bubble production ( even though there are no instantons in this model ) . 
 a simple physical interpretation of the inhomogeneous fragmentation of the field @xmath1 is based on the fact that the interaction @xmath311 corresponds to attraction between the fluctuation modes . as a result 
 , the seed inhomogeneities ( the peaks of the initial random distribution ) will be amplified due to the nonlinear interaction of the fluctuations . 
 a well known example of this type of instability is gravitational instability of matter in the universe .    to study the growth of fluctuations in a more detailed way 
 , one may use the stochastic approach to tunneling and bubble formation developed in @xcite . 
 the main idea of this approach can be explained as follows . 
 tunneling can be represented as a result of the accumulation of quantum fluctuations whose amplitude greatly exceeds their usual value determined by the uncertainty principle . 
 this happens when the long wavelength quantum fluctuations responsible for the tunneling correspond to bosonic excitations with large occupation numbers . in such cases 
 one can treat these fluctuations as classical fields experiencing brownian motion due to their interaction with the short wavelength quantum fluctuations . 
 suppose that the large fluctuations of the scalar field responsible for reheating in the model ( [ cub ] ) initially look like spherically symmetric bubbles ( which is the case if the probability of such fluctuations is strongly suppressed , see above ) . 
 the equation of motion for a bubble of a scalar field @xmath312 in minkowski space is @xmath313 here @xmath314 is a distance from the center of the bubble and @xmath315 . at the moment of its formation 
 , the bubble wall does not move , @xmath316 , @xmath317 ( critical bubble ) . 
 then it gradually starts growing , @xmath318 , which requires that @xmath319 a bubble of a classical field is formed only if it contains a sufficiently large field @xmath1 , and if the bubble itself is sufficiently large 
 . if the size of the bubble is too small , the gradient terms are greater than the term @xmath320 , and the field @xmath1 inside the bubble does not grow 
 .    at small @xmath314 the shape of the bubble can be approximated by @xmath321 . in this approximation 
 , the bubble has a typical size @xmath322 , and @xmath323 . 
 therefore at the moment of the bubble formation , when @xmath324 , one has @xmath325 replacing @xmath326 by @xmath327 one finds that the bubble can be considered a result of overlapping of quantum fluctuations with typical momenta @xmath328 , where @xmath329 here @xmath266 is some numerical factor reflecting uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath294 . 
 let us estimate the probability of an event when vacuum fluctuations occasionally build up a configuration of the field satisfying this condition . in order to do 
 it one should remember that the dispersion of quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath1 with @xmath330 is given by @xmath331 . 
 this gives @xmath332    this is an estimate of the dispersion of perturbations that may sum up to produce a bubble of the field @xmath1 that satisfies the condition ( [ 11 ] ) . 
 of course , this estimate is rather crude . but let us nevertheless use eq . 
 ( [ 14 ] ) to evaluate the probability that these fluctuations build up a bubble of a radius @xmath333 containing the field @xmath1 at its center . 
 assuming , in the first approximation , that the probability distribution is gaussian , one finds : @xmath334    let us first apply this result to the theory @xmath183 
 . in this case one finds @xmath335 note that the factor in the exponent in ( [ 15a ] ) to within a factor of @xmath336 coincides with the euclidean action @xmath337 in eq . 
 ( [ 4 ] ) . 
 taking into account the very rough method we used to estimate @xmath294 and calculate the dispersion of the perturbations responsible for tunneling , the coincidence is rather impressive . 
 it was shown in @xcite that this approach gives exactly the same answer as the euclidean approach for the case of tunneling during inflation when @xmath338 . 
 most importantly , this method allows us to investigate tunneling and the development of instability in the theories where instanton solutions do not exist @xcite . 
 in particular , for tunneling in the theory @xmath339 one finds @xmath340 we included here the subexponential factor @xmath341 , which is necessary to describe the probability of tunneling per unit time per unit volume . 
 this means that tunneling is not suppressed for @xmath342 . 
 this result is in agreement with our previous estimate ( [ typical ] ) . 
 now let us take into account that the total time of the development of instability is a sum of the time of tunneling plus the time necessary for rolling of the field down . 
 one can show that the time of rolling down is inversely proportional to @xmath343 , i.e. it decreases at large @xmath1 . 
 also , the subexponential factor @xmath344 grows at large @xmath1 , which makes tunneling to large @xmath1 faster . 
 consequently , as we already discussed above , the main contribution to the development of instability is given by the fluctuations with @xmath345 . 
 exponential suppression of the probability of such fluctuations leads to their approximate spherical symmetry . 
 the results of our lattice simulations for this model are shown in fig . 
 [ 2gif ] . in this 
 model bubbles form quickly enough ( unlike in the model @xmath346 ) , so we were able to start with quantum fluctuations centered at @xmath347 and allow the bubbles to form . 
 the bubbles ( high peaks of the field distribution ) grow , change shape , and interact with each other , rapidly dissipating the vacuum energy @xmath4 . 
 = 6.5 cm 1 cm = 6.5 cm    -0.8 cm    = 6.5 cm 1 cm = 6.5 cm 
 -0.8 cm    = 6.5 cm 1 cm = 6.5 cm    figure [ cubicdistrib ] shows the probability distribution @xmath197 in the model ( [ cub ] ) . as we see , in this model the field distribution also rapidly relaxes near the minimum of the effective potential within a single oscillation . in this case 
 the histogram in the beginning looks pretty chaotic because of bubble formation and bubble wall collisions , which we could see in the previous figure . 
 one should note that the numerical investigation of this model involved specific complications due to the necessity of performing renormalization . 
 lattice simulations involve the study of modes with large momenta that are limited by the inverse lattice spacing . 
 these modes give an additional contribution to the effective parameters of the model . 
 in the limit of zero lattice spacing these corrections would become infinite , but they are regularized by the lattice cutoff . in our simulations of the simple model ( [ ab1 ] ) 
 these corrections gave a contribution to the effective mass of the field @xmath1 that was much smaller than @xmath348 and therefore did not affect our results . 
 meanwhile , in the cubic model similar corrections induce a ( fictitious ) linear term @xmath349 . 
 this term should be subtracted by the proper renormalization procedure , which brings the effective potential back to its form ( [ cub ] ) . 
 see the appendix for more details . 
 this was the first time in our simulations when a careful treatment of high frequency modes was necessary . 
 a similar situation may occur in any theory where @xmath350 , such as the theory @xmath24 discussed in the previous section . 
 figure [ cubicocc ] shows the occupation numbers of produced particles in the model ( [ cub ] ) with @xmath351 . 
 these occupation numbers grow up to @xmath177 
 @xmath352 within a single oscillation , which is in good agreement with our estimate ( [ occcub ] ) . 
 in this paper we studied the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which occurs when a scalar field falls down from the top of its effective potential . 
 we have found , in agreement with @xcite , that the main part of this process typically completes within a single oscillation of the distribution of the scalar field . 
 this is a very unexpected conclusion that may have important cosmological implications . 
 one of the most efficient mechanisms for the creation of matter after inflation in theories with convex effective potentials ( @xmath353 ) is the mechanism of parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations in the process of homogeneous oscillations of the inflaton field , which was called preheating @xcite . 
 it has also been noted that in the case where potentials become concave ( @xmath354 ) , preheating may become more efficient @xcite . 
 now we see that this effect is very generic . in many theories with concave potentials the energy of an unstable vacuum state 
 is transferred to the energy of inhomogeneous classical waves of scalar fields within a single oscillation of the field distribution . 
 we emphasize here that we are talking about the oscillations of the field distribution rather than about the oscillations of a homogeneous field @xmath1 because quite often the homogeneous component @xmath355 of the field @xmath1 remains zero during the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking . 
 one of the important consequences of our results is the observation @xcite that in many models of hybrid inflation @xcite the first stage of reheating occurs not due to homogeneous oscillations of the scalar field but due to tachyonic preheating @xcite . a detailed discussion of this effect will be contained in @xcite . 
 the process of preheating and symmetry breaking may take an especially unusual form in the theory of brane inflation @xcite based on the hybrid inflation scenario and the mechanism of tachyon condensation on the brane antibrane system @xcite . 
 the situation in models of the type used in the new inflation scenario is somewhat more complicated . in these models 
 the potential is also concave . 
 however , the expansion of the universe stretches inhomogeneities of the field rolling down from the top of the effective potential and makes it homogeneous on an exponentially large scale . therefore to evaluate a possible significance of tachyonic instability in this regime one must compare the amplitude of the homogeneous component of the field with the amplitude of the quantum fluctuations . 
 the result appears to be very sensitive to the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking in such models . 
 a preliminary investigation of this issue indicates that in small - field models where the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking is much smaller than @xmath356 , the leading mechanism of preheating typically is tachyonic . 
 if correct , this would be a very interesting conclusion indicating that in large - field models the leading mechanism of preheating typically is related to parametric resonance , whereas in small - field models the main mechanism of preheating is typically tachyonic , at least at the first stages of the process . 
 we will return to the discussion of this issue in a coming publication @xcite . 
 finally we should mention that an interesting application of our methods can be found in the recently proposed ekpyrotic and pyrotechnic scenario @xcite . even though we are very skeptical with respect to the ekpyrotic / pyrotechnic scenario for many reasons explained in @xcite , it is still interesting that the methods developed in the theory of tachyonic preheating provide us with a very simple theory of the generation of density perturbations in these models @xcite .

 the lattice calculations reported on in this article were all done using the program latticeeasy , developed by gary felder and igor tkachev . the program records the value of the fields and derivatives at each point on a spatial grid with evenly spaced points . 
 the fields are then evolved using their classical equations of motion @xmath357 the use of the classical equations is justified because the instability discussed rapidly drives the fields to a state with exponentially large occupation numbers , meaning they effectively act as classical fields @xcite . although latticeeasy is designed to ( optionally ) include the effects of cosmological expansion on field evolution all of the simulations reported here were done in a flat spacetime background . 
 the effects of expansion will be discussed in subsequent publications ( @xcite ) . 
 time evolution is done with a staggered leapfrog algorithm using a fixed time step . 
 the initial conditions for the fields and derivatives are set in momentum space and then fourier transformed to give the initial spatial distribution . 
 the initial values of the modes are given by quantum fluctuations . 
 each mode has a random phase and a gaussian random amplitude with expectation value @xmath358 the exception to this is the coleman - weinberg potential for which the initial conditions were set by the instanton configuration described in the text . 
 note that ordinarily the equations for quantum fluctuations would have @xmath359 in the place of @xmath159 in the formula above . 
 for the models discussed here , however , we were simulating a quench in which the effective squared mass of the fields is presumed to have rapidly become negative . 
 thus we used initial conditions corresponding to massless fluctuations . 
 for some of the runs here we imposed a momentum cutoff , setting @xmath360 for all modes above a certain momentum @xmath159 . 
 such cutoffs eliminated unphysical effects from quantum fluctuations that were not excited to large values . in each such case 
 we also ran without the cutoff and found the results to be qualitatively similar except for the addition of high frequency noise in the field distribution . 
 the plots shown in this paper show either field values ( which are self - explanatory ) , probability distribution functions ( pdf ) , or occupation number spectra . 
 the pdf of a field is obtained by dividing the field values on the grid into evenly spaced bins and simply counting the number of gridpoints in which the field value was in each bin . 
 the occupation number is defined by fourier transforming the field and computing for each mode by eq . 
 ( [ number ] ) , where @xmath361 , @xmath362 for @xmath363 . for @xmath364 
 one can use either @xmath365 or @xmath366 . 
 all plots shown in this paper except fig . 1 and fig . 
 2 use @xmath367 when @xmath364 but the results were qualitatively similar using either definition . the occupation number @xmath75 is given by averaging over a spherical shell in fourier space . 
 this definition coincides with the standard one in the end of the process , where the mass squared becomes positive and topological defects disappear . 
 the full details of these lattice calculations can be found in the documentation available on the latticeeasy website at  http://physics.stanford.edu/latticeeasy . 
 moreover , these calculations have been discussed in previous publications of ours ( e.g. @xcite ) . 
 this is our first publication where we discuss simulations that used renormalization , however , so we will discuss this procedure in the next section . 
 the last section of the appendix lists the parameters used for each of the runs illustrated in the paper . 
 as we have discussed , the justification for doing a classical calculation for quantum fields is that once the field fluctuations are amplified sufficiently quantum effects are negligible . 
 there are some cases , however , when these quantum effects may be important , and in such cases they may be ( partially ) accounted for through a simple form of renormalization . 
 consider how this applies to the lattice calculations discussed here . 
 initially the field fluctuations are only those representing quantum vacuum states . 
 these fluctuations affect couplings , masses , and the total energy of the system in a way that is dependent on the lattice spacing . 
 for example , consider the theory @xmath368 and rewrite the field @xmath37 as the sum of a homogeneous component @xmath38 and fluctuations @xmath67 . 
 the effective potential felt by the homogeneous field @xmath1 will receive a correction ( among others ) from the fluctuations equal to @xmath369 ( the @xmath370 is cancelled by a coefficient arising from combinatorics . ) 
 this correction represents an unphysical effect in the sense that its strength depends on the ultraviolet cutoff imposed by the lattice . in the limit of zero lattice spacing 
 where arbitrarily large momenta would be included on the lattice this correction would become infinite . 
 this would add an unphysical term @xmath371 to the effective potential . 
 this effect can be eliminated , however , by adding a counterterm @xmath372 or equivalently by adding the term @xmath373 to the equation of motion for @xmath1 . 
 note that @xmath217 in this case refers to the value that arises from initial quantum fluctuations , not to a dynamic quantity that changes as the field evolves and fluctuations grow . 
 such changes represent physical effects and should not be eliminated . in effect 
 this correction eliminates the linear term in the potential at @xmath28 when the field is in the vacuum state . 
 the above example illustrates how a simple form of renormalization can be implemented on the lattice . 
 this procedure could in principle be used to renormalize any mass , coupling constant , or energy term in the theory . 
 ordinarily these corrections are not important ( unless one uses a very large value of the momentum cutoff ) because the quantum effects are quickly swamped as the fluctuations become amplified 
 . we did not find it necessary to use renormalization for any models except the cubic one , where we used it as described here to prevent the field from artificially rolling away from @xmath28 due to the induced linear term . 
 in this section we list the parameters used for the lattice simulations from which all of the figures in the paper were drawn . 
 the models discussed in the paper will be referred to here simply as quadratic ( model [ ab1 ] ) , complex ( model [ ab1 ] with @xmath179 replaced by @xmath236 ) , quartic ( model [ cw ] ) , and cubic ( model [ cub ] ) .

19,"one of the most serious issues in light - front field theory ( lfft ) is the complicated renormalization procedure@xcite . if we wish to solve relativistic bound state problems by diagonalizing _ 
 finite _ dimensional hamiltonian matrices numerically , we are forced to make a kind of tamm - dancoff ( td ) truncation@xcite , which restricts the total number of particles in any intermediate states . 
 although this has been very powerful in two - dimensional field theories such as the massive schwinger model@xcite , it causes a serious problem in the renormalization program in higher dimensions . 
 it is because loop diagrams contain more particles in the intermediate states and thus may not be included in the high fock sectors in the td approximation . on the other hand , 
 the corresponding counterterms are not excluded by the td truncation in a similar way . 
 this is the source of the so - called `` sector - dependent '' counterterms@xcite . 
 how is it possible to solve the relativistic bound state problem with a _ finite _ dimensional hamiltonian without hitting the above - mentioned problem ? 
 a field theoretical hamiltonian is infinite dimensional in two aspects : ( 1 ) in a relativistic field theory , fluctuations of all scales couple each other . a high - energy fluctuation ( or state ) couples to a low - energy one in a similar way as a low - energy one does . 
 the hamiltonian is therefore infinite in `` energy space . '' 
 ( 2 ) a relativistic field theoretical hamiltonian usually contains interactions which change the particle number of a state . 
 if we represent the hamiltonian in a fock space , many - body states couple to few - body states . 
 the hamiltonian is infinite in `` particle number space . '' in order to obtain an effective finite dimensional hamiltonian matrix we have to have the control over the high - energy states and the many - body states . 
 our hope is to simulate the effects of the many - body , high - energy states on the low - energy , few - body states by a set of effective interactions which do not change particle number so much and do not couple to high - energy states either . in this way 
 , we might be able to justify the description of a bound state as a weakly bound system of the constituents . 
 the `` parton picture '' of bound states is most apparent in light - front quantization . 
 this is precisely the reason why we are interested in lfft . 
 a renormalization group approach is necessary to control the effects of high - energy and many - body states . 
 the conventional notion of renormalization is to simulate the effects of high - energy states by a set of local operators , called counterterms . 
 it is obvious from the discussions in the previous paragraphs that we need to generalize it so that counterterms also simulate the effects of many - body states . 
 it is useful to distinguish two different renormalizations , though they are closely related in a complicated way . 
 ( 1 ) `` energy renormalization '' controls the effects of high - energy states . 
 it is almost identical to the conventional one . 
 the only difference comes from light - front quantization ; in equal - time theory , a high - energy state is a high - momentum states , while on the light front , a high - energy state may have a small momentum . 
 this implies that the counterterms in lfft are no longer local . 
 nevertheless we still hope that we may use the covariant perturbation theory in this renormalization . 
 ( 2 ) `` td renormalization''@xcite deals with the effects of many - body states . 
 probably , the most useful scheme for the td renormalization is the similarity transformation of the hamiltonian@xcite . 
 a similarity transformation does not change the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . by appropriately choosing the similarity transformation 
 , one may make the hamiltonian more diagonal . 
 the idea is to use similarity transformations to make the hamiltonian more diagonal _ in particle number space_.    there are two advantages in this approach : ( 1 ) we may be able to use the covariant perturbation theory in the first step . 
 this is important because the covariant perturbation theory is very powerful in revealing the divergence structure . 
 furthermore , it is much easier to obtain the effects of loops than in the old - fashioned perturbation theory , or , by a perturbative similarity transformation in energy space . 
 ( 2 ) the troubles of td truncations are avoided at least partially . 
 the effects of the higher fock states are included as the effective ( induced ) interactions generated in the td renormalization . 
 the similarity renormalization group approach is proposed by gazek and wilson@xcite ( and by wegner@xcite independently ) and discussed by the ohio - state group extensively@xcite . 
 the similarity renormalization group is designed to avoid small energy denominators in the old - fashioned perturbation theory and to eliminate the interactions which change the _ energies _ of the unperturbed states drastically . 
 there are two problems in their approach : ( 1 ) it is hard to incorporate with loop diagrams . 
 the coupling constants do not run in the calculations so far done@xcite . 
 as far as they do not run , it is easy to obtain the so - called `` coherent '' hamiltonian@xcite . on the other hand , however , if one goes to higher orders and takes into account the running , one would face to the difficulty of getting it . 
 ( 2 ) after the similarity transformation , there are still interactions which change the number of particles . in the calculations 
 so far done , such interactions are usually ignored . in our two - step approach , we take advantage of the covariant perturbation theory to incorporate with the loop contributions in the first stage , while the interactions which change the number of particles are eliminated systematically . 
 the td truncation now becomes a part of the approximation , which can be improved systematically .    in this paper 
 , we discuss a simple example to illustrate the basic idea of the two - step perturbative td renormalization . 
 the model is a @xmath0-dimensional ( discretized ) field theory which is a kind of hybrid of @xmath0-dimensional equal - time @xmath1 theory and the one quantized on the light front . 
 this model exhibits the mass , coupling constant , and wave function renormalization at the second - order in perturbation theory . 
 we first obtain the counterterms in the feynman perturbation theory . 
 we then diagonalize the hamiltonian in a naive tamm - dancoff approximation . 
 we see that the lowest energy state is almost independent of the cutoff if the counterterms are included , while the first excited state become more cutoff dependent if the counterterms are included . 
 this illustrates the necessity of the sector - dependent counterterms in a naive tamm - dancoff approximation . 
 next we eliminate the interactions which change the number of particles perturbatively by a similarity transformation . 
 the resulting effective hamiltonian is diagonal in particle number space . 
 we then diagonalize the effective hamiltonian numerically . 
 the lowest energy state is almost independent of the cutoff . 
 it is one of our main results to show that the next - to - lowest energy state is also almost independent of the cutoff , despite that we work in a severely truncated space . 
 let us begin with the definition of the model , which we call `` @xmath2 theory . '' 
 the hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 where `` momenta '' @xmath4 are integers . 
 the unperturbed energy @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 may be interpreted as mass . 
 we assume that the cutoff @xmath8 , a large integer , is much larger than the mass @xmath7 and the coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small enough so that the perturbation theory works well . 
 as we will see , this model is `` trivial '' ( see eq.([lambdarg ] ) ) , we keep the coupling constants and the cutoff small so that we do not approach to the landau singularity . 
 the creation and annihilation operators are assumed to satisfy the usual commutation relations . 
 @xmath11=\delta_{n , m}.      \label{commutator}\ ] ]    this model is similar to the usual equal - time @xmath1 theory in @xmath0 dimensions but the interaction terms which contain only annihilation operators or only creation operators are absent . 
 ( this is a typical feature of lfft . ) 
 we regard @xmath9 and @xmath10 as two independent coupling constants . unlike the light - front @xmath1 theory , on the other hand , the `` momentum '' @xmath12 can take negative values . 
 the unperturbed dispersion relation is also different from the usual ones . 
 therefore this @xmath2 theory should be regarded as a hybrid model and should be studied on its own right . 
 the reasons why we consider this model are : ( 1 ) it is extremely simple , and ( 2 ) it exhibits mass , coupling constant , and wave function renormalization already at the second order in perturbation theory . 
 one can study the effects of renormalization easily in this simple model . 
 note that the model is invariant under the transformation @xmath13 . 
 the eigenstates are divided into the `` odd '' sector , which contains odd number of particles and the `` even '' sector , which contains even number of particles . 
 the fock vacuum is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian with the eigenvalue zero . 
 the lowest energy state above the vacuum is the ( physical ) one - particle state , while the first excited state is a ( physical ) two - particle state . 
 it is easy to develop feynman perturbation theory for the @xmath2 theory , though it has no covariance . 
 for example , the propagator is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the operator in the interaction picture , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unperturbed hamiltonian . 
 in the usual way , one can readily obtain the feynman rules . 
 ( see fig.1 . )      in the second - order perturbation theory , the self - energy ( fig.2-a ) for the @xmath2 theory is given by @xmath18 where all the momenta are cutoff at @xmath19 . 
 one can show that @xmath20      we consider the 2-to-2 ( or @xmath10-type ) interaction and the 1-to-3 ( or @xmath9-type ) interaction separately .    for the @xmath10-type interaction , 
 there are two kinds of one - loop diagrams in the second order . 
 the first one is a _ fish _ diagram ( fig.2-b1 ) , @xmath21 the second one is an _ exchange _ diagram ( fig.2-b2 ) , @xmath22 note that there are four similar exchange diagrams .    for the @xmath9-type interaction , 
 there is only one kind of one - loop diagrams in the second order ( fig.2-c ) , @xmath23 there are three similar diagrams .      in order to eliminate the divergent contributions , we add the following counterterms , @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( we are very sloppy in fixing the finite parts of the counterterms ( the renormalization conditions ) . ) note that we do not make any rescaling ( wave function renormalization ) of the operators . 
 in this section , we discuss a naive tamm - dancoff approximation and the effects of the renormalization considered in the previous section . 
 we truncate the fock space up to including three particle states . for simplicity , we only consider the states with total momentum zero . 
 such a state can be expanded as @xmath26}^{\min\{2n,\lambda\ } }       \left({1\over \sqrt{2}}\right)^{\delta_{k,2n } }       \left({1\over \sqrt{2}}\right)^{\delta_{n,2k } }       \varphi_{n , k}a_{n}^{\dagger}a_{-n+k}^{\dagger}a_{-k}^{\dagger }       |0\rangle ,      \label{state}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] stands for the largest integer which is not larger than @xmath28 ( gauss symbol ) . 
 note that the normalization condition of the state @xmath29 is @xmath30}^{\min\{2n,\lambda\ } }      |\varphi_{n , k}|^{2}=1 . 
 \label{normalization}\ ] ]    one can diagonalize the hamiltonian in this restricted fock space numerically . fig . 
 3-a and fig . 
 3-b show the cutoff dependence of the lowest energy states with and without the counterterms . 
 it is easy to see that the lowest state energy is almost independent of the cutoff if the counterterms are included , while the first excited state energy is almost independent if the counterterms are _ not _ included . 
 this is because of the td truncation . in this restricted fock space 
 , one of the particles in the two - particle sector can not get the self - energy contribution , because the intermediate states would contain four particles and are therefore out of the restricted fock space . 
 if one can include , say , up to ten - particle states , the lowest energy states would not suffer from this disease because in lfft they usually have negligibly small high fock components . in practice , however , such a large fock space is not feasible . 
 it is therefore necessary to avoid this problem . 
 it is important to note that the hamiltonian itself has a very simple structure . 
 it can act on a state with any number of particles . 
 what it does is to change the particle number by two at most . 
 the trouble is the restriction on the _ total _ number of particles in a _ 
 state_. it suggests that we should restrict the _ difference _ of the particle numbers in a state between before and after the interaction is applied . 
 the _ difference _ has no sector dependence , of course . 
 if we can turn off the interactions which changes the particle number of a state , there is then no sector dependence . 
 this is the basic idea of the similarity transformation in `` particle space '' which we discuss in the next section . 
 let us first consider the similarity transformation in particle space in a general setting . consider a hamiltonian @xmath31 of the form , @xmath32 where @xmath33@xcite . the interaction @xmath34 does not change the particle number while @xmath35 does . 
 if we includes counterterms ( through the second order in the coupling constants ) , we will have additional terms ( eq.([counterterms ] ) ) , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are of @xmath10-type and @xmath39 is of @xmath9-type and @xmath40 which comes from the self - energy does not change the particle number . 
 we make a similarity transformation from @xmath31 to @xmath41 by using a unitary operator @xmath42 so that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 stands for the part of the hamiltonian which changes the particle number . 
 we are going to find such an operator @xmath45 perturbatively . 
 we expand @xmath45 in a power series of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath46 note that @xmath45 must be zero when @xmath47 . 
 therefore @xmath45 does not contain the terms proportional only to a power of @xmath10 .    by expanding in the coupling constants , 
 the transformed hamiltonian @xmath41 has the form , @xmath48 )      + \lambda w + \lambda^{2 } w ''      \nonumber \\      & & { } + g^{2}(w''+i[r_{2},h_{0}]+i[r_{1},v]-{1\over 2 }      [ r_{1},[r_{1},h_{0 } ] ] )      \label{expanded } \\      &   & { } + g\lambda(v'+i[t_{1},h_{0}]+i[r_{1},w ] ) + \cdots . 
 \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] the requirement that @xmath49 determines @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 up to the matrix elements between the states with the same particle number . 
 we fix this ambiguity simply by setting them zero . for example 
 , we have @xmath53 for the states @xmath54 and @xmath12 with different particle numbers while @xmath55 otherwise . in a similar way 
 , we have @xmath56      -{1\over2}[r_{1},[r_{1},h_{0}]]\right\}_{mn } ,      \label{r2 }   \\      ( t_{1})_{mn } & = & { i\over \omega_{n}-\omega_{m } }      \left\{v'+i[r_{1},w]\right\}_{mn } ,      \label{t1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] for the states @xmath54 and @xmath12 with different particle numbers , while @xmath57 otherwise . 
 the effective hamiltonian thus takes the following form , @xmath58       -{1\over2}[r_{1},[r_{1},h_{0}]]\big)_{\delta n = 0}.      \label{effham}\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that the counterterm @xmath39 does not contribute to the effective hamiltonian through this order . 
 this is a good thing because the corresponding diagrams are not included in the similarity transformation . 
 see fig.4 . 
 we are now ready to obtain the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath2 theory . in this section , 
 we use the notation @xmath59      in the one - particle sector , the interactions @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in eq.([effham ] ) do not contribute . 
 the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 . 
 the effective interaction ( the sum ) comes from the self - energy ( fig.5 ) . 
 for the zero momentum state , the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath62    as shown in fig.6 , the eigenvalue @xmath63 is almost independent of the cutoff @xmath8 if the counterterms are included . 
 the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian in the two - particle sector is @xmath64+[(1+a)|k_{2}|+\mu+b ]      \nonumber \\      & & { } -{g^{2}\over      6}\sum_{\mathbf{l}}\left[{\delta_{k_{1},l_{1}+l_{2}+l_{3}}\over      \sum_{i=1}^{3}\omega_{l_{i}}-\omega_{k_{1}}}+      { \delta_{k_{2},l_{1}+l_{2}+l_{3}}\over      \sum_{i=1}^{3}\omega_{l_{i}}-\omega_{k_{2}}}\right]\big\ }      ( \delta_{k_{1}',k_{1}}\delta_{k_{2}',k_{2 } }      + \delta_{k_{1}',k_{2}}\delta_{k_{2}',k_{1 } } )      \nonumber \\       &   & { } + { 1\over 2}\big\ { ( \lambda+4d )       \nonumber \\       & & { } -{g^{2}\over 4}\sum_{p , q}\big [       \big({1\over \omega_{k_{1}'}+\omega_{p }       + \omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{2 } } }       + { 1\over \omega_{k_{1}}+\omega_{p}+\omega_{q }       -\omega_{k_{2}'}}\big )       \delta_{k_{2},k_{1}'+p+q }      \nonumber   \\       &   & { } + \big (       { 1\over \omega_{k_{1}'}+\omega_{p}+\omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{1 } } }       + { 1\over \omega_{k_{2}}+\omega_{p}+       \omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{2}'}}\big )       \delta_{k_{1},k_{1}'+p+q }      \label{twobody }   \\       &   & { } + \big (       { 1\over \omega_{k_{2}'}+\omega_{p}+\omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{2 } } }       + { 1\over \omega_{k_{1}}+\omega_{p}+       \omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{1}'}}\big )       \delta_{k_{2},k_{2}'+p+q }      \nonumber   \\       &   & { } + \big (       { 1\over \omega_{k_{2}'}+\omega_{p}+\omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{1 } } }       + { 1\over \omega_{k_{2}}+\omega_{p}+       \omega_{q}-\omega_{k_{1}'}}\big )       \delta_{k_{1},k_{2}'+p+q}\big]\big\ }       \delta_{k_{1}'+k_{2}',k_{1}+k_{2}}.      \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] it is easy to see that the terms in the first braces come from the self - energy of two particles , while the ones in the second braces include the contributions from the exchange diagrams and the counterterms ( fig . 
 a two - particle state with zero momentum can be written as @xmath65 by applying the effective hamiltonian on this state , one can get the schrdinger equation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 \nonumber \\      & & { } + { 1\over \sqrt{2}}(\lambda+4d )      \label{h0n }   \\

 the eigenvalues can be obtained by numerical diagonalization . 
 the results are shown in fig . 
 the lowest energy state in the two - particle sector corresponds to the first excited state of the whole hamiltonian . 
 the most important thing is that the energy of this state is almost independent of the cutoff when the counterterms are included . in other words , we have successfully renormalized the model so that the td truncation does not cause a serious problem . 
 in this paper , we have proposed a new two - step renormalization procedure and applied it to a simple model . 
 we have obtained the effective hamiltonian which does not contain the particle - number - changing interactions . 
 the effective hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically . 
 the spectrum is almost independent of the cutoff . in this section , 
 we discuss several aspects of our approach .      what is the difference between the two - step approach and the gazek - wilson - wegner ( gww)@xcite similarity renormalization ? 
 let us consider the one - particle effective interaction for the @xmath2 theory induced by the gww similarity renormalization , @xmath69 where @xmath70 . 
 the sum is divergent . in the gww similarity renormalization scheme , 
 the counterterms are introduced to make these contributions finite . in this case , the counterterms to be added are @xmath71      \delta_{k',k } ,      \label{gwwct}\ ] ] up to a finite part determined by the renormalization condition . note that because of the different cutoff of the sum , the counterterms are similar to ours but different . 
 now , in the standard osu approach , one invokes `` coupling coherence''@xcite . in the present case , it is easy to obtain the so - called coherent hamiltonian , @xmath72\right\}\delta_{k',k } ,      \label{coherent1}\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 . 
 the parameter @xmath75 should be considered as the renormalization scale . 
 it is obvious that this is essentially the same as eq.([onebody ] ) , apart from the choice of the cutoff . 
 the effective two - particle interactions induced by gww similarity renormalization are more complicated . to the second order , 
 the induced interactions obtained by lowering the cutoff from @xmath8 to @xmath75 are @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 with @xmath82 . 
 the counterterms necessary to make the matrix elements eq.([gwwtwo ] ) finite are @xmath83       + \left [       { 3\over 2}\lambda+{3\over 2}(|k_{2}|-2\mu)\ln\lambda       \right ]       \right\}.      \label{gwct2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    although the structure is similar , this effective hamiltonian is more complicated than that of eq.([twobody ] ) . 
 this is mainly because of the cutoff employed in the gww similarity renormalization which introduces a lot of theta functions . 
 ( if one uses a more sophisticated smeared function , the expression would contains integrations . ) 
 the point is that one has to examine the divergence structure in this complicated expression in order to obtain the counterterms . 
 the real differences between the two approaches are : ( 1 ) there are still effective induced interactions , together with the canonical one , which _ change _ the particle number by two in the gww approach ( if @xmath84 ) . to restrict the fock space to the two - particle space is to throw away the interactions . 
 ( 2 ) the treatment of the @xmath10-type interactions is different . in the gww approach , 
 the counterterms for the @xmath10-type interactions are introduced to make the induced effective interactions finite . on the other hand , 
 the counterterms in the two - step approach are obtained in the first step altogether while the @xmath10-type interactions are kept intact in the second step . 
 there is no _ fish _ effective interaction . see fig . 
 ( 3 ) in the gww approach , only the matrix elements between the states of similar energies survive , while in the two - step approach , any matrix elements between the states of the same particle number survive . 
 this third point may cause a non - perturbative difference , which is discussed in the next subsection . 
 the gww similarity renormalization is elegant in the sense that it generates an effective hamiltonian and the counterterms in one shot . 
 but in practice , our two - step renormalization procedure is easier and more systematic . 
 it is important to see how the `` vanishing energy denominators '' are avoided in the two - step renormalization . 
 the problem of `` vanishing energy denominators '' is fake in the sense that it happens because of our poor choice of the unperturbed states . 
 one should instead invoke the degenerate perturbation theory . in the feynman perturbation theory , 
 on the other hand , this never becomes a problem because in calculating green functions , energies ( or , more appropriately , `` frequencies '' ) can be kept off mass - shell . 
 a difficult problem in the two - step approach is the non - perturbative divergences which arise from the @xmath10-type interactions . in the @xmath2 theory , the chain diagrams ( fig . 
 9-a ) are generated upon diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian in the two - particle sector . 
 they diverge as @xmath85 , where @xmath12 is the number of chains . 
 this type of non - perturbative divergences can be canceled if @xmath86 is used instead of @xmath87 . 
 furthermore , we have ladder diagrams for the exchange interactions ( fig . 
 9-b ) . upon diagonalization , 
 a complicated mixture of these diagrams occur . 
 we need the counterterms to cancel the divergence .    within the present approximation , the coupling constant @xmath9 does not run and the one - loop renormalization group equation for @xmath10 , @xmath88 can be solved easily . 
 the solution is @xmath89 although it improves the @xmath8-independence of the energies of two - particle states , its validity is still restricted by the perturbative nature . 
 ( the equation ( [ rge ] ) is derived at the one - loop level . )    in the gww approach , this kind of non - perturbative divergences does not seem to occur because the @xmath10-type interaction is replaced with effective interactions which have matrix elements only between the states of similar energies . 
 this difference is not crucial , however . 
 in the two - step approach , one may eliminate the hamiltonian matrix elements between the states of very different energies by utilizing the ambiguity of @xmath90 for the states @xmath54 and @xmath12 which have the same number of particles . 
 alternatively , one may make a further similarity transformation for the effective hamiltonian in the energy space . 
 one of the authors ( k. h. ) would like to thank robert perry for explaining the osu strategy to him . 
 he also acknowledges the discussions with billy jones , brent allen . 
 both of the authors are grateful to kazunori itakura and the colleagues in kyushu university for the discussions . 
 as we will see , this second step has little to do with divergences ; they are extracted in the first step . 
 the word `` renormalization '' is used in its broadest meaning that the effects of the states which are neglected are simulated by a set of effective interactions .

20,"the newly discovered class of super - earths ( planets with masses between 1 and 10 m@xmath2 ) brings planet detection into a mass regime that has not previously been studied , due to the lack of such planets in our solar system . 
 the recent detection of the first _ transiting _ super - earths @xcite has allowed for the first measurements of mass _ and _ radius , and therefore bulk density of these objects . since super - earths lie in an intermediate mass range between terrestrial planets and the gas / ice giants of our solar system , the question arises as to where the dividing line lies between these two classes of planets . 
 super - earths with thick hydrogen / helium atmospheres ( `` sub - neptunes '' ) may have experienced formation histories that are similar to those of other gas giants , whereas predominantly solid planets that are true scaled up analogs of the terrestrial planets in our solar system would instead be thought of as `` super '' or large earths . 
 gj 1214b @xcite is the second known transiting super - earth , and also the first such planet to likely posess significant gaseous envelope . 
 the planet s mass ( 6.6 m@xmath2 ) and radius ( 2.7 r@xmath2 ) imply a density that is too low to be explained by rock and water ice alone . 
 indeed , a comparison against theoretical mass - radius relationships predicted for solid exoplanets @xcite reveals that gj1214b lies in a region of parameter space where a significant h / he atmosphere is the most likely explaination for the planet s observed properties . in their discovery paper , @xcite state 
 that a low - density composition for the planet , made up of 75% water ( ice ) , 22% silicate rock , and 3% iron would still necessitate a h / he atmosphere of 0.05 mass percent to explain the planet s radius . 
 this corresponds to a h / he atmosphere of approximately 70 bars . 
 such a planet lies somewhere on the spectrum between terrestrial planets , and gas or ice giants , making this a highly interesting new object for study . 
 the presence of a significant h / he atmosphere on gj 1214b is not confirmed however by the mass and radius measurements for this planet . 
 @xcite find that the observed mass and radius of gj 1214b can be explained if the planet is composed of at least 47% water accompanied by a massive _ steam _ atmosphere . 
 additionally , @xcite point out that their measured radius of the planet s m - dwarf host star , gj 1214 , is inconsistent with theoretical models . if in fact the radius of the star is 15% smaller , as predicted by models @xcite , then the radius of the planet , gj 1214b , would also be smaller by a comparable amount  resulting in a planet that does not require a large atmosphere to explain its observed radius . 
 given the uncertainties in the nature of the atmosphere of gj 1214b , follow - up observations aimed at detecting the spectral signature of the planet s atmosphere will be necessary to confirm its molecular makeup . 
 this could be accomplished via secondary eclipse ( emission ) or occultation ( transmission ) spectroscopy . 
 both methods have been shown to be successful in characterizing the atmospheres of gas giant exoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 @xcite have pointed out that transmission spectroscopy is an excellent tool for determining the hydrogen content of an exoplanet atmosphere . 
 since the depth of spectral features in transmission is proportional to the atmospheric scale height ( which in turn scales inversely proportionally to the mean molecular weight of the planetary atmosphere ) , a hydrogen - rich atmosphere will exhibit spectral features in transmission that are up to a factor of 20 larger than those of a hydrogen - depleted co@xmath0 atmosphere . for gj 1214b , 
 the expected signature of a hydrogen - rich atmosphere would manifest itself on a level of @xmath10.1% relative to the m - dwarf ( m4.5 ) host star . 
 such precision has been shown to be obtainable with current space - based observatories  both hubble ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and spitzer ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 in this paper we present calculations of transmission and emission spectra for possible atmospheres on the planet gj 1214b , ranging in composition from hydrogen - rich to hydrogen - poor . 
 we present our model and its parameters in section  [ methods ] . 
 we then present our resulting spectra in section  [ results ] , and we conclude with some thoughts on combining our models with observations to constrain the nature of gj 1214b s atmosphere in section  [ conclusion ] . 
 we consider atmospheres for gj 1214b ranging from hydrogen - dominated solar composition gas to hydrogen- and helium - depleted atmospheres made up of predominantly heavier molecules . 
 the six different cases of atmospheric composition that we investigate are :    1 .   _ solar composition atmosphere _  for this case and the two that follow , the molecular species that make up the atmosphere appear in equilibrium abundances ( see section  [ model ] , for more details ) . 
 30 @xmath3 enhanced metallicity atmosphere _  here we use the base composition of atmosphere # 1 , but in this case the abundances of all species except for h and he are enhanced by a factor of 30 . 
 50 @xmath3 enhanced metallicity atmosphere _  here the metallicity is enhanced 50 times relative to solar . 
 100% water ( steam ) atmosphere _ 5 .   _ 
 50% water , 50% co@xmath0 atmosphere _ 6 .   _ 
 co@xmath0 atmosphere plus trace gasses _ 
 this model atmosphere is composed of 96.5% co@xmath0 with other trace gasses appearing in venusian abundances , notably 3.5% n@xmath0 and 20 ppm h@xmath0o . 
 simple energy balance arguments for the atmosphere of gj1214b yield a day - side equilibrium temperature of 660 k for redistribution of incident energy over the day side only , and 555 k for efficient redistribution over the entire planet , if the planet s bond albedo is zero . 
 @xcite found that all planets orbiting m - dwarfs should have very low albedos , in the absence of clouds or surfaces that efficiently scatter incoming starlight . 
 the reason for this is that m - stars give off most of their light in the ir , rather than the visible , and at these wavelengths rayleigh scattering is extremely inefficient . 
 the planet therefore absorbs nearly all of the incident starlight , rather than scattering it away . for h 
 / he dominated atmospheres we calculate self - consistent models that justify this zero - albedo assumption . to bracket the likely range of atmospheric temperatures , 
 we compute models with day - side and planet - wide energy redistribution  @xmath4 and 555 k , respectively .      for the three hydrogen - dominated compositions that we consider ( cases 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , we calculate temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profiles using the lte model atmosphere code of @xcite , as applied to irradiated exoplanets by @xcite . for the remaining three hydrogen - depleted atmospheres ( cases 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , we calculate t - p profiles according to the model developed in @xcite . 
 both model atmospheres determine radiative equilibrium t - p profiles in hydrostatic equilibrium , which then switch over to adiabatic profiles in regions where the atmosphere is found to be convectively unstable . 
 the fortney et al . 
 model self - consistently calculates the atmospheric temperature structure by determining the levels where the incident flux from the host star is absorbed into the planetary atmosphere as a function of wavelength , and balancing this energy input against the re - emitted flux from the planet . 
 ( see @xcite for a description of the opacity database . ) 
 we find a bond albedo of 0.003 to 0.015 for all models , validating the approximation of a zero bond albedo . 
 the @xcite model is simpler , in that it uses a gray approximation for the atmospheric opacities and temperature profile , following the formalism presented in @xcite for an irradiated gray atmosphere  their equation 45 . 
 the resulting t - p profiles for the six different cases of atmospheric composition that we consider are presented in figure  [ t_p ] . 
 our model does not include cases with inverted temperature profiles or sources of non - lte emission . both of these effects have been implied through observations of transiting hot - jupiters @xcite . 
 however , their causes are not sufficiently well - constrained to be self - consistently included in our model at this time .    after determining the temperature - pressure profile , 
 we calculate the planet s emitted spectrum by integrating the equation of radiative transfer through the planet s atmosphere . 
 we assume a planckian source function , and we include the dominant sources of molecular line opacity from 0.1 to 100 @xmath5 m in the ir  ch@xmath6 @xcite , co , nh@xmath7 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , co@xmath0 @xcite , and h@xmath0o @xcite . 
 for the line profiles , we employ a voigt broadening scheme . 
 in addition to the line opacities , we also include collision - induced absorption ( cia ) from h@xmath0 with itself , he , and ch@xmath6 ( * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * and references therein ) , and co@xmath0 with co@xmath0 interpolated between the databases of @xcite and @xcite . 
 we do not include atomic line opacities ( such as the alkali metals ) , since we find that spectral lines from these species are not present at the low temperatures that are predicted in the atmosphere of gj 1214b . 
 instead , we find that a combination of water features and rayleigh scattering dominates the spectra between 0.1 and 1 @xmath5 m . 
 for calculating the transmission spectra we use the same set of molecular line opacities as for the emission spectra , but in this case we solve the transfer equation for a purely absorptive gas to determine the line - of - sight absorption of stellar light through the atmosphere of gj 1214b . here , the incident intensity from the star is calculated by interpolating the model m - dwarf spectra of @xcite to produce a spectrum at the observed temperature ( 3026 k ) and surface gravity ( @xmath8 in cgs units ) of the host star gj 1214 @xcite .    for the three hydrogen - dominated atmospheres , we determine molecular abundances in chemical equilibrium , shown in figure  [ chem ] , using the code described in @xcite . 
 however , the derivation of the t - p profiles utilizes the equilibrium chemical abundances of @xcite . 
 both codes produce consistent mixing ratios for a large number of molecular and atomic species . 
 we present our modeled transmission spectra for gj 1214b in figure  [ transmission ] . assuming that the transmission spectrum probes levels in the planetary atmosphere over a range of 10 scale heights ( @xmath9 ) , then the relative change in transit depth seen throughout the transmission spectrum is given by : @xmath10 for the case of gj 1214b , for a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere , this results in a wavelength - dependent transmission spectrum that can vary in strength by up to 0.3% ( relative to the stellar light ) as a function of wavelength . despite the small size of the transiting planet , 
 this is a large transmission signature , comparable to the transmission signals that have been successfully observed for other ( much larger ) hot jupiter systems . 
 the reason for the large transmission signature is that gj 1214b orbits a very small ( m4.5 , @xmath11 ) star , while the scale height for a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere on this planet is quite large  approximately 150 - 200 km . 
 transmission spectra for the three hydrogen - rich atmospheres are dominated by absorption features due to water and methane . 
 methane is a particularly interesting species in the super - earth atmosphere , since photochemical reactions that destroy methane may occur faster than reactions that create this molecule @xcite . 
 the net result would be an observed methane abundance that is shifted away from its equilibrium value . 
 the methane spectral features at 2.3 , 3.5 , and 7.5 @xmath5 m are therefore interesting diagnostic lines for learning about photochemistry in the atmosphere of gj 1214b . 
 another potential consequence of methane destruction is the possibility of forming soots , which in principle could be an additional gray opacity source @xcite and could furthermore cause a temperature inversion , therefore altering the structure of the planetary atmosphere . 
 such effects must be modeled carefully , and are not included in our current calculation . like methane , nh@xmath7 is also highly susceptible to photodissociation , and the presence ( or absence ) of the ammonia feature at 10.5 @xmath5 m is therefore another useful indicator of photochemical processes at work . 
 the transmission spectra from the top panel of figure  [ transmission ] additionally exhibit co@xmath0 features in some of the hydrogen - dominated atmospheres . 
 in particular , the co@xmath0 features at 4.3 and 15 @xmath5 m are only present in the atmospheres with enhanced metallicity , resulting from the higher c and o abundances in these atmospheres ( relative to solar ) . 
 observations at these particular wavelengths can therefore be used to probe the metal content of the super - earth atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 we caution however that this conclusion is dependent on our assumption of chemical equilibrium , which has been questioned by a number of observations of transiting extrasolar giant planets @xcite . 
 in contrast to the hydrogen - rich atmospheres , the three hydrogen - depleted atmospheres produce predicted transmission signatures at a level of 0.01 to 0.02% relative to the m - star ( bottom panel of figure  [ transmission ] ) , due to the reduced scaled heights in these atmospheres . 
 observations at this level of precision will be very challenging , given the demonstrated capabilities of hubble and spitzer . 
 if follows that observations with instruments aboard either of these telescopes would result in measurements that would be consistent with a flat spectrum . 
 space - based observations revealing a flat spectrum for gj 1214b would therefore rule out the presence of a cloud - free hydrogen - rich atmosphere 
 although h / he atmospheres with haze or cloud layers that extend high into the atmosphere may not be excluded . however , spectra taken at a precision of at least several parts in 10@xmath12 would be necessary to discriminate between atmospheres composed of h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , a mix of these two gasses , or something else entirely . 
 detection of water features between 1 and 3 @xmath5 m and the co@xmath0 features at 4.3 and 15 @xmath5 m may prove to be the most useful in making this distinction . 
 we present emission spectra for gj 1214b in figure  [ emission ] . 
 hydrogen - rich atmospheres with inefficient day - night redistribution have predicted secondary eclipse depths of up to 0.3% . 
 this drops to approximately 0.2% if the heat redistribution is efficient . 
 these signatures are quite large and should be readily detectable with future instrumentation such as miri aboard jwst . 
 unfortunately , the current state of high - precision space - based spectro - photometry is limited to the wavelength range covered by the warm spitzer mission . 
 while the irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m filters aboard spitzer remain in service , all longer wavelength bands , where the secondary eclipse depth is expected to be the largest , are no longer operational . 
 shortward of 5 @xmath5 m , barring the presence of a thermal inversion or non - lte emission from the planet s atmosphere , the predicted secondary eclipse depths drop below 0.1% , which is likely to be prohibitively small for successful detection with spitzer . 
 longward of 5 @xmath5 m a whole host of water , co@xmath0 , methane , and ammonia features are predicted to be present in the secondary eclipse spectra , which could be used as diagnostics of atmospheric chemistry in the @xmath13 region of the atmosphere . 
 it is interesting to note however that a steam atmosphere and the h / he dominated atmospheres actually produce quite similar emission spectra , despite their very different compositions , since water is the dominant source of opacity in both of these cases . in terms of the atmospheric structure , 
 the emission spectra are highly dependent on the temperature structure in the planetary atmosphere and can therefore constrain the presence of temperature inversions in the upper atmosphere of gj 1214b , as well as the total amount of day - night heat redistribution , and the possibility of non - lte emission . 
 despite its observed low density , measurements of the mass and radius of gj 1214b are not sufficient to confirm the presence of a hydrogen - rich atmosphere on this planet . instead , follow - up observations that detect the spectral signature of the planetary atmosphere will be necessary to confirm its chemical composition . 
 fortunately , because the planet orbits a relatively bright and nearby m - star , gj 1214b lends itself to these types of follow - up observations . for a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere on gj 1214b , the expected transmission signature is on the level of 0.1% relative to the host star , and the predicted emission signature ( secondary eclipse depth ) is also on the order of 0.1% . 
 hydrogen - depleted atmospheres produce comparable secondary eclipse depths , but the transmission signature of an h - poor atmosphere is an order of magnitude smaller  only 0.01% . 
 current space - based instrumentation will likely be able to detect the transmission spectrum of gj 1214b , if the planet does indeed posses a hydrogen - rich atmosphere . 
 however , under the assumption of no strong non - lte emission or upper - atmosphere temperature inversions , the next generation of instruments aboard jwst will be needed to measure the emission spectrum of this planet ( and its transmission spectrum if the planet is depleted in hydrogen ) . 
 gj 1214b is currently the only known super - earth that is accessible for space - based follow - up to determine the planet s atmospheric composition . 
 the only other known transiting super - earth at this time , corot-7b @xcite is a smaller planet orbiting a larger and hotter star . 
 even if this planet did have a significant atmosphere , its signature would be too small to detect against the background of its host star . 
 the same fate will befall the super - earths discovered by the kepler mission @xcite . since most of the stars that kepler is targeting are distant ( and therefore faint ) solar - type stars , the prospects for further characterization of the planets detected around these stars are not strong . 
 one way to improve the chances of finding transiting super - earths that are ideal for follow - up is by searching for planets around the brightest stars in the sky , such as has been proposed for all - sky missions like the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) @xcite . 
 the other method is to search for transiting planets orbiting the smallest stars using networks of ground - based telescopes such as mearth @xcite , which is exactly how gj 1214b was discovered . 
 gj 1214b may indeed represent a new class of planets  those which fall in the intermediate range between gas or ice giants , and terrestrial planets . as more transiting super - earths are discovered , and the mass - radius diagram begins to fill in for these smaller planets , it will become clearer whether there is a sharp transition or a smooth continuum between the two types of planets . for 
 now gj 1214b remains an interesting and unique object that is ideally suited for the type of follow - up observations that will reveal more information about the nature of this planet  both its interior and its atmosphere .

21,"fitting the ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) spectrum is a common way to attempt to gain understanding of the sources of these particles . 
 these fits often neglect the galactic component of cosmic rays , which is expected to be small at the very highest energies . 
 however , the energy at which at which this becomes true is not known .    rather than assume a negligible galactic component 
 , we employ a toy model in which composition determines source . in this model , we use the recent composition measurements of the hires prototype / mia experiment@xcite and of hires in stereo mode@xcite . 
 these are shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] . the light component in these measurements , assumed to be protons , is identified with the extragalactic component of uhecrs ; the heavy component , assumed to be iron , is identified with the galactic component . 
 having identified the extragalactic component of the uhecr spectrum , we fit this component using the assumption that the protons have lost energy between their acceleration and our observation , and that the sources are distributed uniformly throughout the universe , with a density that is smoothly varying in time . 
 the fits assume a simple power law spectrum , @xmath3 , with a spectral index @xmath4 identical for all sources . 
 we use the average energy loss model of berezinsky _ 
 et al._@xcite to find the observed spectrum from a source a given redshift . 
 in addition , we use a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation@xcite for the discrete energy losses associated with pion production . 
 the mc is only important for propagating particles from small redshifts , @xmath5 , where the proton interacts only a few times . for propagation from larger redshifts , 
 the distribution of observed energies for a given input energy is a gaussian of ever narrowing width . 
 the mc is run to create an @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix with two million entries for propagation from each redshift , @xmath8 , to our observation . 
 the @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix is calculated every 0.01 step in @xmath8 for @xmath9 to @xmath10 . 
 smaller steps , as small as 0.0001 , are used below 0.05 . 
 sources are assumed to be uniformly distributed at any given redshift , and with a density with which varies as @xmath11 . 
 the mc results at individual redshifts are added together to form an @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix for uniformly distributed sources evolving according given value of @xmath12 . 
 these @xmath8-integrated matrices were formed for @xmath130 to @xmath135 in steps of 0.5 . 
 the fits are performed by varying the normalization , the spectral slope ( @xmath4 ) , and the evolution parameter ( @xmath12 ) . 
 the goodness - of - fit is evaluated using the binned - maximum - likelihood method . 
 the comparison spectra for fitting are calculated by multiplying a vector containing the input spectrum by the @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix using matrix multiplication . 
 the input spectrum vectors are calculated every 0.05 in the spectral index @xmath4 . 
 the comparison spectra for intermediate values of @xmath4 and @xmath12 are found by interpolation . 
 the result of the fit to the most recent hires - i@xcite and hires - ii@xcite monocular spectra is @xmath0 and @xmath1 . 
 this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : bestfit ] . 
 the quoted uncertainties include the effect of the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath12 . 
 this correlation is shown in figure  [ fig : ch2plot ] . 
 not included in this fit are any systematic uncertainties . the largest systematic uncertainty is expected to be due to the details of composition used in the aperture calculation for the hires - ii spectrum . 
 changes in the composition tend to move the best fit point along the trough of figure  [ fig : ch2plot ] , changing the @xmath12 vs. @xmath4 relationship little . 
 upper limit on the flux in two more bins for each measurement are shown above the highest energy actually observed . 
 the black fit line is the sum of the galactic ( green ) and extragalactic ( red ) components . 
 the parameters of the extragalactic component are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . 
 there are 42 data points , giving 39 degrees of freedom in the fit . ] 
 ( @xmath16 ) in @xmath12-@xmath4 space . 
 the first four @xmath17 contours are shown . ] 
 because the uncertainty in composition is a large part of the uncertainty in the parameters in the fit to the spectrum , we were motivated to try to improve on the existing composition measurements , especially below @xmath18 ev . to go to low energies with hires 
 requires using the monocular data sets , and we chose the hires - ii monocular data set for this analysis . 
 unfortunately , the limited elevation coverage of the hires - ii aperture biases our @xmath19 acceptance , with the bias increasing at lower energies . 
 the bias stems from the requirement that we find @xmath19 within that extent of the shower observed in the detector . 
 events that are closer to the detector are more likely to have @xmath19 above the visible range , and thus be cut . 
 furthermore , because lower energies can only be observed close to the detector , events at these energies will have a larger acceptance bias than those at higher energies . 
 this bias precludes performing an elongation rate analysis at energies below @xmath18 ev .    instead 
 , we have chosen to fit the @xmath20  distribution in energy bins to a combination of mc generated @xmath20  distributions from proton primaries and from iron primaries . 
 the @xmath20  distribution in each energy bin is stored in a histogram , and the data histogram is then compared to a mixture of the proton and iron mc histograms to find the best fit proportion of each . 
 the fit is performed using the binned maximum likelihood technique as implemented in the hbook@xcite routine hmclnl . 
 the uncertainty of the fit in each energy bin is taken from the width of @xmath16 as fit to a quadratic in the region about the maximum . 
 an example of this procedure for the bin at @xmath18 ev is shown in figure  [ fig : compfit18 ] . 
 the result of these fits for the data at all energies is shown in figure  [ fig : rawdata ] .    at an energy of @xmath18 ev . 
 the top panel shows @xmath16 as a function of the proton fraction in 1% steps ( black histogram ) , and a polynomial fit to the same ( red line ) . the bottom panel shows the @xmath20   distribution that results from the fit , with the data shown as filled circles with error bars , the proton distribution in blue , the iron distribution in red and the sum in black ]        this fit gives only the proportion of proton and iron in the final , accepted sample ; as such , it is not intrinsically interesting , but must be corrected to find the proton - iron ratio of uhecrs entering the atmosphere . 
 however , one can test this procedure on an independent mc sample where one knows _ a priori _ which events are protons and which are iron . 
 the result of this analysis on the mc sample used to calculate the aperture used in the spectrum analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : rawmc ] . 
 the fits agree very well with what is actually in the sample . 
 the raw composition measurements are corrected using the relative acceptances in the proton and iron mc samples . 
 these are the same mc samples used to provide the comparison @xmath20  distributions used in the fit . 
 the fit proton - iron proportion is interpreted as given numbers of proton events and iron events . 
 these numbers then are separately corrected for the relative acceptance appropriate to each . 
 finally , the proton - iron ratio is recalculated using the corrected numbers of events of each type .    for a mc sample 
 , we can again compare the corrected proton - iron proportion to the input to the mc simulation . 
 this is shown in figure  [ fig : cormc ] . in this case , the input is just the hires prototype / mia and hires stereo composition measurements , where the mean @xmath20  of the data is interpreted as representing a proton - iron proportion given by the distance between the corsika / qgsjet proton and iron lines . 
 the input is in fact given by linear fits to the mean @xmath20  above and below @xmath21 ev . 
 again , the corrected results of the fits agree very well with the inputs to the mc .        finally , we show as a very preliminary result , the corrected proton - iron ratio for the data . see figure  [ fig : cordata ] . 
 this result shows a very light composition ( 90% protons ) above @xmath2 ev . below this energy 
 we measure a sharply lower composition , but with large uncertainties because of few events and a large acceptance correction . 
 the measured composition at high energies is in agreement with the hires stereo measurement , but closer to being all protons . 
 the data used in the fits comes from the same data set used in the hires - ii spectrum analysis which was fit above 
 . a considerable amount of data , about a factor of three more , was collected after this data set . 
 this later data was collected with lower light thresholds , and as such , will have a lower energy threshold . 
 in addition , the aperture at each energy will be increased , reducing the size of @xmath20   biases . 
 performing this analysis on this expanded data set should give us much tighter constraints on the composition in the middle of the @xmath22 ev energy decade . 
 the telescope array ( ta ) , which has already received japanese funding , and the ta low energy extension ( tale ) will be able to push this analysis even further . 
 tale will use the hires phototubes with larger mirrors to push the thresholds even lower . 
 the mirrors will be arranged in a tower rather than a ring to avoid biases in @xmath20 . 
 geometrical resolution at the level of hires stereo will be provided by coincidences with the ta ground array .",0.299092632362765,0.05363984674329501,0.545389771461486,0.29678874211356404,0.047244094488188004,0.525179326534271,0.17992424242424201,0.032869785082174,0.5579209327697751,0
22,"quantum control is an area of research of great current interest with a vast potential for applications in quantum information technologies . 
 @xcite the basic problem of quantum control consists of driving externally a quantum system in order to take it from an initial state to a target final state . 
 quantum control ideas and methods are traditionally widely applied in magnetic resonance @xcite and quantum chemistry , @xcite and they are advancing rapidly in the area of solid state nanostructures . 
 @xcite    in a series of recent publications @xcite we have presented a method of quantum control based on the knowledge of the energy spectrum as a function of a suitable single control parameter . 
 this method is useful provided that the transitions between neighboring levels are well described by the landau - zener model.@xcite the latter condition has allowed us to successfully navigate the spectrum with a combination of diabatic and adiabatic changes of the control parameter . 
 other authors have also employed the navigation of the energy spectrum as a coherent quantum control tool , especially in the field of atomic and molecular systems controlled by lasers . 
 @xcite we have applied our control method to two different physical systems with remarkable success . 
 the first one , which we will study in this paper , is a nanostructured semiconductor system consisting of two interacting electrons confined in quasi - one - dimensional quantum dots,@xcite and the second one was the licn molecule.@xcite in both systems we have been able to connect distant eigenstates through long and complex paths in the energy spectrum with very high probability .    in this paper 
 we take the control method farther : by allowing not only diabatic and adiabatic transitions but also intermediate velocities , we can arrive at more complex final ( target ) states . with this generalized navigation method 
 we are able to achieve the creation of linear superpositions of adiabatic states starting from the ground state . 
 this opens a rich menu of possibilities , like the creation of bell states and other types of entangled states . 
 the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe the main ingredients of our control method . in section [ sec : system ] we present again the two - electron nanostructure 
 . section [ sec : results ] is devoted to the results of the generalized control method . among the results presented , 
 we show how to apply our method to generate bell states and coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates . 
 let us first review the basic ideas of our method in the simplest possible system , i.e.  a parameter - dependent two level system . let us assume that these two levels have an avoided crossing as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : lz ] . at the avoided crossing , 
 the two energy levels approach each other and the associated eigenstates exchange their characteristics as the external parameter sweeps through the crossing . if the avoided crossing is traversed very slowly ( adiabatic path in fig . 
 [ fig : lz](a ) ) , the adiabatic theorem guarantees that one will stay in the initial adiabatic level , but with the paradoxical consequence that the final state will have been exchanged with the other diabatic state . on the other hand , if the avoided crossing is traversed very quickly ( diabatic path in fig . 
 [ fig : lz ] ) , the characteristics of the state are preserved . 
 clearly , these two limiting possibilities suggest a very simple control method . 
 the quantitative meaning of slow and fast transitions is given by the theory of landau - zener transitions.@xcite    this basic idea has allowed us to perform complicated control tasks . 
 namely , we can travel through the energy spectrum using the avoided crossings as sources of efficient controllable choices between two adiabatic states . in this way we can connect distant adiabatic states 
 provided that there exists a path going from one to the other via jumps at avoided crossing and adiabatic evolutions in the absence of crossings . 
 examples of the application of this method have been presented in refs . 
 [ ] .    in this paper 
 we go one step further by using not only diabatic and adiabatic transitions but also transitions with intermediate speeds . 
 this type of transition gives final states ( on exit of the avoided crossing ) which are linear combinations of the two adiabatic states ( fig . 
 [ fig : lz](b ) ) . 
 the combination of several crossings using intermediate velocities allows us to access a great variety of final states . 
 thus , in this work we generalize the control method proposed earlier and present several applications which show the power of the improved control technique . 
 in order to explore on a concrete system the idea of using intermediate speeds to traverse avoided crossings we will study here a system of two interacting electrons inside a quasi - one - dimensional double quantum dot which was used in our previous works . the system is subject to an external , uniform electric field , whose amplitude is used as the control parameter . 
 the confinement of the two electrons is very narrow on two dimensions , which we denote as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the double well profile is defined along the remaining , longitudinal coordinate , @xmath2 . 
 the effective hamiltonian of the two electrons reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective electron mass in the semiconductor material , @xmath5 is the effective coulomb interaction between the electrons , @xcite @xmath6 is the confining potential ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : double - dot ] ) , and @xmath7 is the external time - dependent electric field . we choose as confining potential a double quantum well with well width of 28  nm , interwell barrier of 4  nm , and 220  mev deep ( a typical depth for a gaas - algaas quantum well ) . 
 we normally assume that the initial state is the ground state , which is a singlet . 
 since the hamiltonian is spin independent , the total spin is conserved and the spatial wave function remains symmetric under particle exchange at all times . 
 let us review some characteristics of the energy spectrum of the two electrons and of the eigenstates which will guide our control strategies . 
 first we consider the spectrum as a function of the control parameter ( the external electric field ) . 
 this spectrum is plotted in fig . 
 [ fig : spectrum ] with selected eigenstates . 
 the energies @xmath8 and the eigenstates @xmath9 are obtained by numerical diagonalization . for this calculation 
 , we have used as basis set the symmetric combinations of the twelve lowest single - particle eigenfunctions . 
 thus , our basis set of the two - particle hilbert space has 12*(12 + 1)/2=78 states . 
 an important characteristic of this system in the lower part of its spectrum is that the states have fairly well - defined localization properties . 
 the three possible types of localization ( both electrons in the left dot , in the right dot , or electrons in different dots ) are associated with the three types of slopes seen in the spectrum ( positive , negative , or almost zero , respectively ) . in fig . 
 [ fig : spectrum ] we show some states to illustrate the mentioned localization characteristics . in states a and b the electrons are in different dots , in states c and d both electrons are in the left dot , and in states e and f both electrons are in the right dot . 
 of course , at the avoided crossing the states get mixed and these well - defined properties are lost ( states ( g ) and ( h ) ) . 
 this section is devoted to illustrate the power of the generalized control method in which the velocities to cross the avoided crossings are not restricted to produce diabatic and adiabatic transitions . 
 in other words , we will show the possibilities opened by the ability to allow intermediate velocities . due to the potential for applications of our method 
 , we consider it best to illustrate its power through two important examples of coherent control . 
 an application of quantum control that has been extensively explored in the recent literature is the localization of one or two electrons in a double well potential . 
 the general idea is to start the coherent evolution in the ground state , which in the case of two electrons is delocalized due to the pauli and coulomb repulsions , and end up in a state in which both electrons are in the same well . in order to describe the degree of localization of the two electrons 
 we define the probability for both electrons to be in the left well , @xmath10 . 
 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the evolving wave functions of the two electrons . 
 an easy way to localize both electrons in the left dot using our control method starting from the ground state , consists of varying the electric field adiabatically in order to pass the first avoided crossing between the first two levels located at @xmath13 . 
 this process is shown in the inset of fig . 
 [ fig : avoided_1 ] . 
 ( the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation was obtained using the usual fourth - order runge - kutta method with a time step of @xmath14 . ) 
 the electric field varies linearly with time and we display the evolution of @xmath10 for several velocities . 
 we start at the ground state , and accordingly @xmath15 at @xmath16 . for a high velocity 
 , we expect to cross diabatically the avoided crossing and the localization properties will not change considerably . 
 this case is seen in curve ( i ) ( @xmath17 . ) in fig . 
 [ fig : avoided_1 ] . as the velocity is decreased ( curves ( ii ) to ( v ) ) we approach a final state that is highly localized in the left dot . 
 there is a maximum value of the probability @xmath10 that can be obtained with this method , given by the probability @xmath10 of the adiabatic ground state after the avoided crossing . 
 the probability of the adiabatic ground state is plotted with open circles in fig . 
 [ fig : avoided_1 ] . after the crossing 
 it is a slowly rising function in the plotted range and reaches the value of 0.998 at electric field @xmath18 . 
 we see that for the velocity of curve ( v ) ( @xmath19 ) the evolving probability @xmath20 follows tighlty the open circles and near @xmath18 presents a small oscillation bound between 0.995 and 0.9975 . 
 that is , the maximum value of @xmath21 is approached within a @xmath22 percent . 
 another simple way to obtain localization in this system is what we may call the sudden - switch method , which uses step - wise constant fields.@xcite we wish to compare the effectiveness of both methods to obtain localization . 
 first , let us summarize the basic procedure of the sudden - switch method ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : sudden - switch ] ) . starting from the ground state one applies two successive steps of constant electric field . in the first step one goes from zero field to the field corresponding to the first avoided crossing , i.e. @xmath23 in our case . while the new field is on , the probability @xmath24 oscillates with the frequency corresponding to the energy splitting at the avoided crossing . 
 this oscillation occurs because the initial state is no longer eigenstate of the hamiltonian at the avoided crossing . in fact , it is a 50%50% linear superposition of the two adiabatic states ( eigenstates ) at the avoided crossing . 
 when the probability @xmath24 reaches a maximum , that means that the current state is the other diabatic state . at this time one 
 switches again the field to leave the avoided crossing . 
 far from the avoided crossing the diabatic states are very close to the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and therefore , are approximately stationary . 
 thus , the @xmath24 remains at the highest value attained during the oscillations at the avoided crossing . with this method , 
 a localization @xmath24 of up to 93% can be achieved , as can be seen in fig . 
 [ fig : sudden - switch ] . 
 while the time scales involved in both methods are the same , in comparison , our method has three advantages : ( i ) a higher degree of localization can be obtained ; ( ii ) the sudden - switch method requires a fine adjustment of the timing not needed in our case ; ( iii ) our method is more powerful in the sense that can be used to navigate in the spectrum and connect distant states.@xcite    let us now consider states with a different and in a sense more complex kind of localization . as mentioned earlier , we can find in the spectrum three types of localized states , which we can denote in the following way : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , which have , respectively , both electrons in the right and left dots , and one electron in each dot . 
 ( of course , these states can not be considered to be product states of single - particle orbitals , because quantum correlations are generally present in all of them.@xcite ) we usually refer to the first two types as localized states , and to the third one as delocalized . however , a linear superposition of the first two types can also be considered as localized , in the sense that one knows that both electrons would be found in the same dot if a measurement were performed . in fig . 
 [ fig : rrll ] we show some control paths that may be followed in the spectrum to reach a superposition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . 
 linear superpositions of the form @xmath28 are always available at the center of avoided crossings of states with rr and ll localization . in fig . 
 [ fig : rrll ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show how to go from the ground state to the bell - type states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , using only diabatic and adiabatic transitions . 
 we remark that these states are energy eigenstates , and thus do not evolve further if the electric field is fixed . 
 if the restriction of using only diabatic and adiabatic transitions is relaxed we can traverse the avoided crossing of the two types of states with an intermediate speed thus obtaining a combination of the diabatic states after the crossing @xmath31 the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be tuned by choosing the appropriate velocity . 
 we note that the effects of using intermediate velocities was illustrated previously ( fig . 
 [ fig : avoided_1 ] ) in the context of searching for a ll localized state . 
 we now show in fig . 
 [ fig : rrlltime ] how the path ( a ) of fig . 
 [ fig : rrll ] is obtained by varying the electric field appropriately . in fig . 
 [ fig : rrlltime ] ( a ) we show the electric field and in ( b ) we show the probabilities as a function of time ( semi - log plot ) . 
 to arrive at the desired state , we must cross two avoided - crossing adiabatically , one at @xmath34 and energy @xmath35 , and the other one at @xmath36 and energy @xmath37 . 
 the first avoided crossing involves a rl and a rr state , and the second one , rr and ll states . 
 the energy gap of these avoided crossings are very different , and therefore the time required to cross them adiabatically is also very different . 
 this is way the log scale for the time axis is used in fig . 
 [ fig : rrlltime ] . 
 we see that once the electric field is left constant the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 oscillate between 0.465 and 0.495 while the overlap of the final state with the target one es equal to 0.98 , showing that we have arrived at the desired state . 
 the other two paths shown in fig . 
 [ fig : rrll ] can be realized in a similar way , and with the same degree of success .      in the previous section we used our method to control the localization properties of the target state . 
 now we illustrate the flexibility of our method by obtaining coherent superpositions of several adiabatic eigenstates . for example , we may wish to obtain a linear superposition of the three types of localization having each of them the same weight . 
 that is , we seek a state of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in fig . 
 [ fig:3superposition ] the control path to such a state is shown . in fig 
 [ fig:3sup_field_and_overlap ] we show the overlap of the evolving state with the first six adiabatic states and the electric field ( the control parameter ) as a function of time . to appreciate the evolution in greater detail we plot the evolving state at chosen times in fig . 
 [ fig:3sup_wavefunctions ] . 
 the initial state is the ground state ( see fig . 
 [ fig:3sup_wavefunctions ] , state at time @xmath42 ) , and the final state is a superposition of the states 1 , 5 , and 6 at the electric field @xmath43 ( see fig . 
 [ fig:3sup_wavefunctions ] , state at time @xmath44 ) . 
 we start the evolution by increasing slowly the electric field ( blue arrows in fig . 
 [ fig:3superposition ] ) , so that the state remains at the ground state ( see fig . 
 [ fig:3sup_wavefunctions ] , state at time @xmath45 ) , then we accelerate to cross diabatically the first avoided crossing at @xmath13 , and then we decrease the field ( green arrows in fig . 
 [ fig:3superposition ] ) in order to cross the same avoided crossing in the opposite direction with an intermediate velocity . here 
 the occupation probability is split between the ground state ( 33.3% ) and the first excited state ( 66.6% ) . 
 this is clearly seen at time @xmath46 in fig . 
 [ fig:3sup_field_and_overlap ] . 
 the electric field is further decreased , slowly at first and then rapidly , so that the upper branch crosses the complex avoided crossing at @xmath47 and energy of @xmath48 . then an adiabatic increase follows . 
 we again cross the complex avoided crossing ( time @xmath49 in the middle of the avoided crossing and time @xmath50 after crossing it adiabatically ) . 
 we see that the state at @xmath50 is a combination of a rl and a rr state . 
 we continue slowly until the upper branch approaches the last avoided crossing at @xmath51 . here 
 the velocity is chosen at an intermediate value , so that the occupation probability divides itself equally among the two states . 
 the end result is a superposition of the three states mentioned at the beginning . 
 this is clearly verified in figs . 
 [ fig:3sup_field_and_overlap ] and  [ fig:3sup_wavefunctions ] , state at @xmath44 . in this simulation , 
 the final square overlap with the adiabatic states 1 , 5 , and 6 are respectively @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and then the final probability to find the target state is of 96.45% . 
 in this paper we extended a recently proposed control method for quantum systems with energy spectra , which , as function of a control parameter , are characterized by the presence of avoided crossings . 
 while in previous publications we showed how to work with diabatic and adiabatic changes of the control parameter , that is , using the avoided crossing as a yes - no switch , here we explored the possibility of using intermediate velocities to cross the avoided crossings , thus obtaining linear combinations of diabatic states . 
 this generalization of our previous control strategy enables us to reach more general target states , not restricted to eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian . 
 the results presented here are for a two - electron double quantum - dot structure , but are not restricted to that particular system . since the issue of localization is an interesting one in double - well potentials , we have studied it here as an application of our method . 
 we showed how one can obtain target states with different types of localization , like having both electrons in one given well or having both electron in either well with chosen probabilities ( bell - type states ) . 
 finally , we have shown how to obtain a coherent superposition of three states with each of the three types of localization present in this system .

23,"different theories of quantum gravity particularly string theory and loop quantum gravity predict the thermal nature of black hole horizons @xcite . these theories confirm the semi - classical results of bekenstein and hawking about the evaporation of black holes as a result of emission of charged particles @xcite . in the early seventies , it was found that laws of thermodynamics are applicable to black holes horizons by defining new quantities like entropy ( @xmath3 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . 
 hence the laws of thermodynamics for black holes arise from the geometry of spacetime . more recently in the last few years 
 , several new connections between geometry / gravity and thermodynamics have been found . 
 jacobson found a link between the einstein equation and the thermal relation @xmath5 , where left hand side represents the energy flux @xcite ( see excellent reviews on connections between gravity and thermodynamics @xcite ) . 
 later it was proved that the thermodynamics of black holes is also valid for cosmological horizons @xcite and the friedmann equation can be written as a first law of thermodynamics @xcite . while more recently it is proposed by verlinde that gravity has an entropic origin and newton s law of gravitation 
 arises naturally and unavoidably in a theory in which space is emergent through a holographic scenario @xcite . 
 wormholes are tunnels in spacetime geometry that connect two or more regions of the same spacetime or two different spacetimes @xcite . 
 wormholes are classified in two categories : euclidean wormholes that arise in euclidean quantum gravity and the lorentzian wormholes which are static spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s general relativistic field equations @xcite . 
 interest in lorentzian wormholes arose in order to make them useful for time travel for human beings , hence termed time machines in popular literature @xcite . in order to support such exotic wormhole geometries , the matter required to stabilize them has to be exotic i.e. violating the energy conditions ( null , weak and strong ) , however it has been shown that averaged null energy condition is satisfied in wormhole geometries @xcite . 
 also the violation of weak energy condition ( wec ) can be avoided for small intervals of time @xcite . 
 more recently traversable wormhole and time machine solutions of the field equations of an alternative of gravity with non - minimally curvature - matter coupling have been obtained @xcite . 
 wormholes have been constructed in some alternative theories of gravity including @xmath6 , teleparallel , kaluza - klein , loop quantum gravity , brans - dicke gravity and lovelock gravities , to name a few @xcite and is found that modified gravity can minimize the amount of anisotropy and exotic matter required to support the existence of wormhole s throat . 
 kar & sahdev had shown that if the wormhole spacetime is taken to be evolving ( non - static ) than the matter threading the wormhole geometry need not to be wec violating @xcite . in their model , the wormhole initially inflates and later evolves like a frw spacetime thereby implying our universe to be an evolving wormhole . 
 later anchordoqui et al @xcite extended the previous work @xcite by choosing the non - zero redshift function and obtained evolving wormhole solutions with non - exotic matter . 
 arellano & lobo @xcite found contracting wormhole solutions within non - linear electrodynamics . 
 cataldo et al discussed the construction of evolving wormholes using phantom energy @xcite and more recently using the cosmological constant @xcite . 
 farooq et al @xcite showed that the field equations of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional evolving wormhole can be recast into first law of thermodynamics . 
 debnath et al @xcite investigated the non - static lorentzian wormhole model in presence of anisotropic pressure and showed that the einstein s field equations and unified first law are equivalent for the dynamical wormhole model . 
 inspired by the above works , we are interested to study the thermodynamics of an evolving wormhole at its apparent horizon using general entropy function and two special entropy functions , to be discussed later .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we write down the governing dynamical equations of an evolving wormhole . 
 the previous work of rahaman et al @xcite has some computational errors for wormhole thermodynamics in presence of isotropic pressure . in this work 
 , we correct these assigning with anisotropic pressure in the field equations . in section - iii 
 , we study the wormhole thermodynamics by deriving the expressions of temperature , entropy and surface gravity at the apparent horizon of the wormhole . 
 further we obtain the general expression of the gsl at the apparent horizon valid for any type of entropy function chosen . in section iv , we study the expression of gsl by choosing two well - known forms of entropy functions i.e. log corrected and the power - law corrected in two forthcoming subsections . 
 we analyze the behavior of gsl by choosing a power - law form of scale factor . 
 we briefly discuss our results in section v. 
 a simple generalization of morris - thorne ( mt ) wormhole to the time - dependent background is given by the evolving lorentzian wormhole @xcite @xmath7,\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the scale factor of the universe . the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called the shape function and redshift function respectively . earlier the evolving wormholes have been studied with time - independent redshift function @xmath12 @xcite . 
 if @xmath13 constant and @xmath14 , then the static mt wormhole can be obtained whereas for @xmath15 and @xmath16 constant , eq ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to standard frw metric .    for anisotropic pressure 
 the components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xcite assumed as @xmath17 where , the traditionally homogeneous and isotropic exotic matter source has been generalized to an inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid , but still with a diagonal energy - momentum tensor ( as is usually considered in phantom cosmologies ) . 
 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density , radial and tangential pressures respectively . 
 the einstein s field equations are then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter . here 
 dot and dash stand for the differentiation with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . from eqn ( [ 6 ] ) 
 we have @xmath25 . 
 so without any loss of generality , we can set @xmath26 by re - scaling the time coordinate @xcite . then the field eqns change to @xmath27 from eqns ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) 
 , we have @xmath28 also , from the conservation of energy equation , we get @xmath29 @xmath30 for isotropic pressure , @xmath31 and hence from eqn ( [ 12 ] ) , @xmath32 i.e , @xmath33 becomes a function of time only . 
 also eqn ( [ 10 ] ) shows @xmath34 and thus the metric ( [ 1 ] ) becomes frw metric . to avoid this structure 
 , we must require matter with anisotropic pressure which automatically leads to inhomogeneity . 
 some basic laws of wormhole dynamics have been derived in @xcite , which suggest a genuine connection with thermodynamics . 
 ever since , the thermal properties of wormholes have been studied in literature @xcite . for studying the generalized second law of thermodynamics for an evolving wormhole , 
 let us consider the metric ( [ 1 ] ) as in the following form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the physical radius @xmath37 . 
 + the dynamical apparent horizon ( ah ) @xmath38 is given by @xmath39_{\tilde{r}=\tilde{r}_{a}}=0,\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath40 differentiating ( 15 ) , we have @xmath41}{\big[\tilde{r}_{a}b'\big(\frac{\tilde{r}_{a}}{a}\big ) -ab\big(\frac{\tilde{r}_{a}}{a}\big)+2h^{2}\tilde{r}_{a}^{3}\big]}.\ ] ] the associated surface gravity is defined as @xmath42 i.e. , @xmath43.\ ] ] hence the associated temperature on the ah is @xmath44.\end{aligned}\ ] ] now , we assume a functional form of the entropy on the ah as in the following form @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the entropy function . 
 then @xmath48 then from ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , we may write @xmath49.\end{aligned}\ ] ] on the other hand , for anisotropic pressure the gibb s equation can be defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the entropy within the ah and @xmath52 . 
 so , it can be shown that @xmath53 thus from ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , the variation of total entropy on the ah can be expressed as @xmath54\nonumber\\&&+\frac{4\pi\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}}{3}\big(3\rho+p_{r}+2p_{t } + \frac{\tilde{r}_{a}\rho'}{a}\big)\nonumber\\&&\times\big(\dot{\tilde{r}}_{a}-h\tilde{r}_{a}\big).\end{aligned}\ ] ] if @xmath55 i.e. , if the expression of the r.h.s of above equation is non - negative , then we say that gsl is valid . 
 for this purpose we need to know the entropy function @xmath47 and the shape function @xmath10 . + 
 here we choose a particular form of the shape function as @xmath1 , @xmath56  constant , in order to study the gslt for two different types of wormhole models by choosing two specific forms of the horizon entropy @xmath57 i.e. , logarithmic and power law correction entropies . 
 it is a well - known fact that in einstein s gravity , the entropy of the horizon is proportional to the area , but when the gravity theory is modified by adding extra curvature terms in the action , it also modifies the entropy - area relation . in the context of loop - quantum gravity , this relation can be expanded into an infinite series as @xcite @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the classical entropy and the higher order terms are quantum corrections . here @xmath60 s are finite constants , but their values are highly debatable . 
 for example , some take the value of @xmath61 to be negative @xcite , some positive @xcite , whereas some have taken it to be zero @xcite . 
 this correction has been used in literature for variety of purposes : to study the dark energy models in numerous gravities @xcite , to unify inflation and dark energy models @xcite , study of gsl with log corrections @xcite . 
 + from eq ( [ 26 ] ) , we continue our study by considering the expression of the horizon entropy with the logarithmic correction only @xcite , i.e , for our study @xmath62 so that the entropy function can be written as @xmath63    with this choice of entropy , eqn ( [ 25 ] ) takes the form @xmath64\\ & & -\frac{h\tilde{r}_{a}^{7}}{3g}\big(\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\tilde{r}_{a}^{4 } } -3\dot{h}\big)\big(\frac{h^{2}+\dot{h}}{h^{2}\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\big),\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have used the field equations and eqn ( [ 16 ] ) for the expressions of @xmath65 , @xmath33 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . + for a special choice of the scale factor in power law form which is assumed as @xmath68 . 
 now , we plot the evolution of the total entropy on the ah against time in figure 1 , where the constant @xmath2 has been taken to be equal to @xmath69 ( solid line ) and @xmath70 ( dashed line ) , we see that the gsl is valid for small @xmath2 but as @xmath2 increases , gsl is not obeyed in the later epoch for logarithmic corrected entropy . 
 ( solid line ) and @xmath71 ( dashed line ) . ]      another significant correction term to the horizon entropy expression appeared while dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields inside and outside of the horizon where the wave function of the field is chosen to be a superposition of ground state and excited state @xcite . 
 so the associated power law corrected entropy expression becomes @xcite @xmath72 so that in this case we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 here @xmath77 is called the cross - over scale . 
 the entanglement entropy of the ground state obeys the usual area law whereas the excited state contributes to the correction . 
 thus the correction term is more significant for higher excitations . 
 it is important to note that the correction term falls off rapidly as @xmath78 increases and hence in the semi classical limit ( large @xmath78 ) , the area law can be recovered . 
 this correction has been recently used extensively in dark energy literature : to study the holographic and new - agegraphic dark energy in various gravitational theories @xcite and the study of gsl in frw cosmology with power - law entropy correction @xcite .    for 
 this choice of the horizon entropy , eqn ( 25 ) becomes @xmath79\nonumber\\ & & \big(\frac{a^{2}b_{0}+\dot{h}\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}}{h^{2}\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\big ) \big[\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}}-\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}(\dot{h}+2h^{2})\big]\nonumber\\ & & -\frac{h\tilde{r}_{a}^{7}}{3g}\big(\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\tilde{r}_{a}^{4 } } -3\dot{h}\big)\big(\frac{h^{2}+\dot{h}}{h^{2}\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\big).\end{aligned}\ ] ] here also the field equations together with eqn ( [ 16 ] ) have been used to write the expressions of @xmath65 , @xmath33 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . 
 for a special choice of the scale factor in power law form which is assumed as @xmath68 . 
 now , we plot the evolution of the total entropy on the ah against time in figure 2 , where the constant @xmath2 has been taken to be equal to @xmath69 ( solid line ) and @xmath70 ( dashed line ) , we see that the gsl is valid for small @xmath2 but as @xmath2 increases , gsl is not obeyed in the later epoch for power law corrected entropy . 
 hence the behavior is analogous for both power - law and log - corrected entropies . 
 ( solid line ) and @xmath71 ( dashed line ) . ] 
 let us find some exact solutions of the system ( [ 7])-([9 ] ) . 
 \i ) let @xmath80 , then @xmath81 . 
 substituting these expressions into ( [ 7])-([9 ] ) we get ( below we assume @xmath82 ) @xmath83 now let us introduce the eos parameters as _ r(r , t)=,_t(r , t)=.[37 ] for the solutions ( [ 34])-([36 ] ) we obtain @xmath84},\label{38 } \\ \omega_t&=&\frac{2n(2 - 3n)a^{2}_0r^{3}t^{2n-2}+(b - rb^{'})}{2r[3n^2a^{2}_0r^{2}t^{2n-2}+b^{'}]}. \label{39}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in these formulas we have one arbitrary function @xmath10 and parameters @xmath85 . 
 let us we assume that in the @xmath24-direction we have an accelerated expansion so that we can put @xmath86 . then from ( [ 38 ] ) we determine the unknown function @xmath10 as b(r)=r[c - na^2_0r^2t^2n-2],[40 ] where @xmath87 . 
 to get rid of the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath88 we put @xmath89 . then finally from ( [ 40 ] ) we get b(r)=r[c - a^2_0r^2],[41 ] so for the eos parameters we get @xmath90    \ii ) our next example is by taking @xmath91 . then for the density of energy , pressures and eos parameters we get the same expressions as in the previous case . 
 we get @xmath10 from ( [ 38 ] ) b(r)=cr^-+a^2_0r^3t^2n-2,[44 ] where @xmath87 . 
 to get rid of the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath88 we put @xmath89 . then finally we get b(r)=cr^--a^2_0r^3,[45 ] following @xcite 
 , we can check the stability conditions for this evolving wormhole . 
 these conditions include certain restrictions on the form of shape function including ( 1 ) @xmath92 , at the wormhole s throat ( 2 ) @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( flare - out condition ) and ( 3 ) @xmath95 , as @xmath96 ( asymptotic flatness ) . 
 clearly the last condition for ( [ 45 ] ) is not satisfied , however the first two condition impose the following inequality @xmath97    in our case the formulas ( [ 38])-([39 ] ) become @xmath98},\label{46 } \\ \omega_t&=&\frac{b - rb^{'}-2a^{2}_0r^{3}}{2r[3a^{2}_0r^{2}+b^{'}]}.   \label{47}\end{aligned}\ ] ] so from these formulas and ( [ 45 ] ) finally we get @xmath99 consider particular cases . 
 1 ) let @xmath100 that is raditation . 
 then @xmath101 the solution suggests a radiation state parameter in the @xmath24 direction while a phantom energy state parameter @xmath102 . 
 \2 ) let @xmath103 that is phantom matter . 
 then @xmath104 3 ) let @xmath105 that is ekpyrotic matter . 
 then @xmath106 it is interesting to note that in this case we have the ekpyrotic matter in @xmath24-direction and phantom in @xmath107-direction if @xmath108 . so that @xmath109 is a cruical value . 
 \iii ) now let us consider the case _ 
 r0=.[56 ] in this case @xmath10 takes the form b(r)=cr^,[57 ] then the expressions for the parameters of eos ( [ 38])-([39 ] ) become @xmath110 . 
 \label{59}\end{aligned}\ ] ] from ( [ 58 ] ) , it is easy to see that a cosmological constant state parameter can not be obtained . in other words , an evolving wormhole can not be constructed and supported from vacuum energy . 
 ( eq.[59 ] ) ]    against @xmath24 and @xmath23 , both having same range on the horizontal axes . 
 the model paramters are fixed at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 . 
 in this work , we have studied the basic equations of evolving lorentzian wormhole by assuming the anisotropic pressure . 
 the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gsl ) at the apparent horizon of an evolving lorentzian wormhole has been analyzed in general way when we have considered the horizon entropy proportional to a function of the horizon area . 
 we have obtained the expressions of thermal variables at the apparent horizon . 
 choosing the two well - known entropy functions i.e. power - law and logarithmic , we have obtained the expressions of the variation of the total entropy using gibb s equation . 
 we have analyzed the gsl using a simple well established power - law form of scale factor @xmath0 and the special form of shape function @xmath1 . 
 it is shown that gsl is valid in the evolving wormhole spacetime for both choices of entropies if the power - law exponent @xmath2 is small , but for large values of @xmath2 , the gsl is satisfied at initial stage and after certain stage of the evolution of the wormhole , it violates .

24,"the fifth dimension has been discussed in the scientific literature for seventy years or more . historically , the preponderance of attempts to use five dimensions  @xcite combine a gravitational theory similar to einstein s  @xcite with an electromagnetic theory similar to maxwell s  @xcite . 
 the earliest versions were modeled after the general theory of relativity  @xcite , while later attempts to combine other interactions  @xcite are considerablely more intricate . 
 the integration of quantum ideas into theories has been frustrating and inconclusive . 
 quantum mechanics is usually appended by attaching a hilbert space to each region of space - time . 
 it is suggested here that there is a wholly geometrical a way to describe physical phenomena , including quantum mechanics . 
 the historical exclusion of quantum mechanics from fundamental classical theories is deemed arbitrary . 
 it is proposed that the essential elements of quantum mechanics reside within natural geometrical structures  @xcite . 
 quantum mechanics becomes an inherent , inseparable part of the mathematics . 
 the basis of classical unified field theories rests on the work of h. weyl @xcite and t. kaluza @xcite . 
 the association of these ideas with quantum mechanics has been know for some time . 
 following earlier studies for the weyl theories  @xcite , it has become possible to develop a five dimensional geometrical quantum theory . 
 several particular assumptions need to be discussed . by stating unusual starting points , it is hoped to save the reader the difficulty of inferring them from the conclusions .    much of the einsteinian viewpoint is adopted . 
 microscopic trajectories are hypothesized as a universal description of the effects of quantum mechanics , electromagnetism and general relativity . 
 while the success of this approach for quantum theory is not yet established , it allows the direct discussion of gravitational phenomena . in accord with the goal of a wholly geometrical theory , 
 the mathematics is hard deterministic and time symmetric . 
 quantum probabilities must be associated with a congruence of statistically populated trajectories . because of the metaphysical conflicts between quantum theory and relativity , certain concepts must be refashioned to allow the synthesis . 
 the vector potential plays a more prominent role . 
 metrics in higher dimensions have modified interpretations . 
 the hilbert space becomes a calculational artifact and not a starting point . 
 electrodynamics is assumed time symmetric , along the lines of the classical articles by feynman and wheeler  @xcite . for geodetic motion that includes electromagnetic effects 
 , the force of radiative reaction must be due to fields derived from other particles . 
 there can be no force of radiation until the interacting ( absorbing ) particles are included in the field sources . for a quantum gravitational theory , this time 
 symmetric construction must be supposed to exist at a metaphysical level that is deeper than the macroscopic structure of maxwell . 
 electrodynamics is assumed to derive from a primitive classical truth of geometry , comparable with general relativity . in a microscopically deterministic theory , the question of the separation of causal agents from their effects becomes problematical . 
 this does not appear to contradict the experimental situation . 
 a precise definition of causality probably can not have a microscopic formulation in a theory that is hard deterministic , time symmetric and quantum mechanical . without a primitive assumption 
 , it is supposed that time asymmetry and the associated causality follow from macroscopic effects that may depend on other conditions in the universe . 
 these conditions may include statistical mechanics , cosmology , psychology or the real physical effects of other interactions  @xcite . 
 microscopic time asymmetry is not eliminated in principle but does not contribute to the discussion . 
 the geometrical concept of a congruence is associated with the quantum mechanical state function of a particle . 
 wave particle duality is not considered essential . 
 since emission and absorption is the only known evidence for photons , they are assumed to be calculational artifacts that derive from charged particle quantum mechanics  @xcite . 
 finite mass particles , having time like trajectories , are the only true particles . 
 interactions are mediated by fields . 
 any discreteness in the fields ( photons or gravitons ) derives from the discreteness of the source particles  @xcite . 
 it is assumed that the fields have no dynamical qualities except that which is implied by the sources . 
 fundamental free fields are rejected .    to describe more that one particle , the mathematical field structure must be augmented . 
 gravity is conventionally approximated by a single metric tensor that specifies the global distortion of space - time . 
 in such an approximation , a collection of particles @xmath0 moves in a space - time specified by a metric that is a solution of a set of gravitational field equations . 
 this single metric is insufficient when constructing a combined theory of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics . 
 the structures are not analogous . 
 these latter effects are described by fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one each for each particle . 
 of course the approximation of a universal metric for a collection of simple particles is usually valid , particularly in the laboratory . 
 however when quantum mechanics and electrodynamics are integrated with gravity , an analogous collection of metrics @xmath3 is required . 
 these metrics can be treated as equal under many experimental situations ; but in principle , even microscopic gravitational interactions are present and provide interparticle forces . 
 consequently each particle must have a formal wave function , vector potential and metrical tensor , @xmath4 . 
 an extended principle of equivalence is made possible since the motion of each particle can be the result of different combinations of assigned fields . 
 a special metric @xmath5 , identified with the observer of general relativity , is maintained separately from the individual metrics of the particles . 
 it represents the structure of space - time as measured with neutral particles and the idealized null trajectories of electromagnetic interactions . 
 multiple metrics have been used at least since dirac  @xcite and are implied by the conformal invariance of weyl  @xcite . 
 other multiple metric theories of gravitation are listed by ni  @xcite . 
 a classical observer does not perceive quantum mechanics or electromagnetic fields to be part of space - time geometry . 
 if these effects are to be intrinsic , a separate phenomenology of charged and neutral particles must be defined . 
 hypothetical mirrors are assumed to be neutral objects to the observer . 
 forces of radiative reaction on a mirror are neglected or compensated during gravitational space - time measurements and the individual charged particles which make up the mirror are treated collectively . 
 the observer s metric @xmath5 is used to describe the perceived pattern of the collective motion of many particles . as a mathematical object , 
 it retains multiparticle phenomenology and can not be measured by using a single particle wave function or quantum state . 
 observations depend on idealized measurements of composite particles and clocks that traverse each point with different velocities  @xcite . 
 each such independent direction requires at least one wave function  @xcite . 
 four dimensional space - time , must be derived in this way from a larger geometry as a limit or approximation . 
 stable , massive , neutral , primitive ( non - composite ) particles are required . 
 since there are none known , the phenomenological metric may not have a basis in the motion of elementary particles but may only have a well defined meaning as a description of collective motion . 
 an increase in dimensionality always leads to new quantities and interpretations . 
 it is supposed that each particle , no matter how it might be described ultimately , projects onto a time like trajectory in the observer s space - time . 
 thus , the directly observed dimensionality is always three plus one . 
 the effects of new coordinates must be inferred . 
 a similar problem occurs in the transition to four dimensions . starting with three space dimensions 
 , the metric assigns positions and distances to palpable objects . 
 the pythagorean theorem can be verified ( or falsified ) by direct measurement . 
 relativity demonstrates this space to be incomplete . 
 it must be extended to include time . in doing this , 
 the developed procedure of using light beams to find the components of the four metric , is not even qualitatively equivalent to the use of a simple ruler . in space - time 
 , the experimental determination of geodesics is completely different . 
 presumably , any further extension beyond four dimensions will involve crucial conceptual modifications . by analogy 
 , one would expect five dimensional measurements to be even less pythagorean than four dimensional measurements . 
 modifications in the metrical interpretation mitigate the need for cylindricity or dynamical compactification . 
 instead , the use of null five - vectors is sufficient . 
 arbitrary non - null five vectors can be constructed but they are not used here to represent physical quantities . 
 as the geodesics of light are null in four - space , the geodesics of particles are null in five - space . 
 this seems to be important for the relationship between weyl and kaluza - klein theories as well as for the proper inclusion of quantum effects . 
 if the velocity vector is null , then the motion can be represented by four parameters alone . 
 the essential vector length variations of weyl theory are incompatible with a riemannian theory unless the vectors map into null riemannian vectors . 
 a fractional change in a weyl vector can be mapped onto a null vector because a fraction change in a null riemannian vector is permitted . in this way 
 , transformations within the riemannian system can be related to apparent conformal effects . 
 a non - null extension may be possible but such vectors can not be related to a weyl theory . a rigid metrical five dimensional structure that is analogous to our perception of three - space is assumed in many other theories . 
 these , even when followed by the application of spontaneous compactification will not allow for the implicit inclusion of quantum mechanics . 
 because of the physics of geometrization , the construction of lagrangians has not been found useful . 
 the physical quantities that have reasonable covariance properties are often null or unavailable and the usual suppositions lead to quantities which are identically zero . 
 lagrangian mechanics was originally motivated by the need to extend calculations to situations involving constraints , such as rigid bodies or contact forces . 
 this motivation is unjustified in relativistic theories since rigid bodies do not exist and contact elasticities are finite . 
 furthermore , the origin of these contact constraints is directly from the quantum mechanics of collectively interacting particles . 
 this questions the epistemological assignment of lagrangians as a basis for quantum mechanics . 
 there is no apriori reason to believe that theories developed to describe constraints , should provide a basis for microphysics . 
 the convenience of choosing interaction terms in a lagrangian increases descriptive strength but reduces predictive power . 
 it has been found necessary and advantageous to choose differential equations without recourse to any construction of classical mechanics . 
 a few less controversial questions may be worth mentioning . a full discussion of second quantization is not made here . 
 such a formalism would represent the description of more than one particle , possibly including particle creation and annihilation . 
 these complexities will have to be deferred until the one particle system is better understood . at present 
 , only a partial version of a geometrically appropriate quantum electrodynamics is available . 
 a complete systematic discussion is needed . 
 spin , weak and strong interactions are also deferred . 
 an understanding of elementary quantum methods is deemed a necessary prerequisite . 
 a number of other constructions found in the literature have not been incorporated . 
 magnetic monopoles are not used . 
 five dimensional monopole solutions are supposed nonphysical and may be mathematical ghosts  @xcite . 
 strings  @xcite may show similarities but do no follow the formalism . 
 there are no discrete lattices . 
 solitons are not used . 
 space - time is not treated stochastically  @xcite . 
 there is no torsion  @xcite . 
 there is no topological compactification , dynamical or otherwise  @xcite . 
 because of the difficulty of precisely defining the difference between quantum and non - quantum theories , classical mechanics is intended to refer to the limit , as @xmath6 and not to any fundamental classical theory . 
 these particular assumptions should provide a usable basic starting point . 
 surely reality is more complicated . 
 it is useful to associate the fifth dimension of a five dimensional riemannian space with the proper time . 
 let the defining equation for @xmath7 be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the einstein summation is in effect . 
 lower case greek indices are summed over four values and lower case latin indices are summed over five . 
 equation  ( [ fdpte ] ) is intended to apply to the standard observer of four dimensional space - time . 
 it is proposed that nullity of five displacements is maintained for primitive particles even when off diagonal terms are appended . 
 a neutral particle has a fifth coordinate defined by the path integral of @xmath11 the space - time coordinates define @xmath12 , up to an additive constant . 
 further constructions will indicate that electromagnetic or quantum effects occur when @xmath13 . 
 it is supposed that the nullity of displacements for charged neutral particles is maintained in the presence of the electromagnetic field . 
 the particle intrinsic fifth coordinate will not necessarily be the same as the neutral space proper time . in this case , an inferred physical comparison of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can determine a physical value for the new terms @xmath16 . in the neutral case @xmath17 
 is not well defined and is arbitrarily set to -1 . 
 time like displacements are represented by real proper time values in conventional units .    for classical relativity , 
 the accumulation of differences in the proper time along distinct trajectories is second order . 
 no cross terms , @xmath18 , occur . 
 the twins of the twin paradox are neutral objects and experience second order age corrections . 
 the direct observation of first order terms , which are only assigned to primitive particles , is not possible because a real physical clock can not be attached to the five space trajectory . 
 the usual principle of equivalence is intended , historically , for uncharged classical particles in a four dimensional theory  @xcite . 
 when attempting to extend this , the existence of particles with different charge to mass ratios causes an essential difficulty . 
 even more , quantum diffraction depends inversely on the mass and destroys compositional additivity . 
 a principle of equivalence must therefore be constructed for a single isolated particle characterized by particular charge and mass value . 
 particles having different interactions , ( electromagnetic or quantum ) must use tensors of different internal construction . 
 the particle properties are incorporated into the fields that determine the local particle rest frame . 
 the mass must enter with a factor @xmath19 . as will be shown in a paper to follow , 
 this factor is a scale size of the fifth dimension much as the speed of light is the scale size of the fourth dimension . 
 this construction presumes that the mass ratios of fundamental particles are ultimately derivable geometrical quantities . 
 factors of @xmath19 are taken to appear in combination with all masses . 
 this factor also appears in the fine structure constant because the quantum manifestation of the inertial force is a standard quantity against which the electric forces are measured . 
 the geometrical extension can be motivated by physical argument . 
 consider a gedanken experiment performed on two idealized particles . 
 each of these should be isolated , non - composite , stable , and of finite mass . 
 the first one , denoted by @xmath20 is neutral and does not respond to electromagnetic fields . 
 the second , denoted by @xmath21 is charged . 
 it responds in the classical limit according to the lorentz force law . 
 following figure  ( [ f1 ] ) , the two particles begin on the left with coincident motion . 
 a single rest frame making both particles equivalent can be obtained . 
 the particles separate as they traverse a region where the electromagnetic field tensor is nonzero . the field in this region 
 can be adjusted so that after exiting , both particles converge to intersect at space - time point @xmath22 with distinct velocities @xmath23 . at @xmath22 , 
 the particles can not be made equivalent even though they were equivalent at @xmath24 . 
 the usual sense of the equivalence principle dictates that it should be possible to perform continuous coordinate transformations to find an invariant local rest frame for either particle . within general relativity 
 , there is no way to do this .    to resolve the paradox , additional geometrical quantities can be used to describe velocities that may have electromagnetic ( or quantum ) origin . either a four dimensional non - riemannian weyl geometry or a five dimensional riemannian geometry is possible . 
 these supply additional electromagnetic - geometrical transformations which describe the motion of charged particles without affecting the motion of idealized neutral objects . in this way , a principle of equivalence can be used . 
 the nullity of the displacement vector , as applied to an individual particle is related to the concept of a killing vector . 
 it will be seen that the equivalence of the trajectories under displacements is related to the equivalence of the different forces that might cause a deflection . 
 different parts of the trajectory can not be equivalent as viewed by the neutral observer because the acceleration appears to have different causative explanations . 
 that is , the effective field and source currents vary along the congruence . 
 several studies have been made of the intrinsic relationship of the aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite with five dimensional theories  @xcite . 
 as a realizable example , applied to this gedanken experiment , it is particularly interesting since neither the neutral nor the charged particle actually enters the region where the field tensor is non - zero . 
 there is however a difference in deflection which is experimentally observable and can not be described by the conventional principle of equivalence in space - time . 
 the metric tensor , @xmath15 , and electromagnetic vector potential , @xmath25 , have known classical geometrical interpretations . 
 it is desirable to adjoin a wave function without a first quantization process . as a first step , 
 the classical equations must be rewritten in a fixed gauge form  @xcite . 
 the usual gauge freedom is assumed non - fundamental and is transformed to a fixed value specified by making the action identically zero . 
 ( any analogous wave function will have its phase removed . ) 
 the standard classical five metric , having signature @xmath26 is appropriate and can be written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 . 
 it is sufficient to show that a velocity defined by @xmath29 defines a classical null geodesic . 
 the absolute derivative of the above is @xmath30 } \ ] ] wherein the christoffel symbols are calculated with respect to the neutral space four metric @xmath5 this can be converted into the conventional form since the hamilton - jacobi equation with fixed gauges is @xmath31 . 
 the covariant derivative of this equation can be used to eliminate the second christoffel symbol which gives @xmath32 here , the path parameter @xmath33 is normalized relative to the neutral space four metric . 
 direct derivations from the five metric are given in references  @xcite , either by the lagrangian method or by parallel transport . 
 these agree with the above fixed gauge calculation and give the the combined force law . 
 this establishes that the fixed gauge equation of motion  ( [ nfxf ] ) is a valid construction in the presence of gravitational and electromagnetic fields . 
 this description defines a congruence of motion which is the set of integral curves of a fixed gauge vector potential field . 
 such an individual congruence , which is a general solution of the hamilton - jacobi system , can be developed into a quantum state . 
 selection of a whole congruence need not specify a particular trajectory as the unique trajectory of a particle . to completely specify such a quantum state , a quantum field equation is required . for a scalar field , 
 the klein - gordon equation is used . 
 such a quantum solution , when written in a fixed gauge representation can not in general have a normalized vector potential as in the classical representation . 
 the magnitude @xmath34 is not constant . 
 this is true even though the unnormalized vector potential still satisfies the inhomogeneous maxwell equations . to make the system amenable to quantization 
 , it is assumed at this point that the unnormalized vector potential is still suitable as a purveyor of the physical quantity within the geometrical system . 
 this identification can be applied to both the weyl and kaluza theories . 
 the resulting congruence contains , under reasonable conditions and with reasonable physical assumptions , the information that was contained in the original wave function . 
 any phase information has been incorporated directly into @xmath35 , only the magnitude of @xmath36 need be regenerated . 
 this can often be done , in practical cases from the current conservation alone . 
 global reconstruction may require recourse to the field equation and boundary conditions . 
 the essential idea is that such a congruence is sufficient to represent the essential part of a single particle quantum state function . 
 the local structure of the five dimensional coordinate system is larger than the the four dimensional lorentz group . 
 the additional transformations are necessary for the principle of equivalence discussed in section  [ ecq ] . 
 an interpretation can be developed by applying the new transformations as local point operations on a charged particle . 
 a related problem is mentioned in  @xcite . 
 the usual transformations involving the observer s coordinates @xmath37 still apply and affect the vector potential covariantly . 
 the transformations involving @xmath12 are new , and because of the fixed gauge assumption , have specific physical effects and interpretations . 
 they are affine and orthogonality is not maintained . 
 the most useful of these is @xmath38 and changes the four - velocity of the charged particle according to @xmath39 the electromagnetic vector potential is thereby identified with a shear transformation . if the arbitrary path increment @xmath40 is selected equal to the apparent proper time change , @xmath41 , the transformation  ( [ alct ] ) gives a new velocity for the particle . 
 such transformations represent a realignment of the five dimensional space . 
 it is used to describe velocity changes that are of quantum or electromagnetic origin as distinguished from those that are gravitational .    using @xmath42 for the kinetic momentum 
 , @xmath43 identifies the quantum nature of the transformation because of the similarity with the minimal substitution . 
 this assumption identifies the motion as a first order quantity relative to the neutral system . 
 a lorentz transformation , as a contact transformation in space - time , changes the velocity of the particle and also the value of @xmath44 . 
 the new value represents the instantaneous particle motion and also the local effective transformed orientation of the five dimensional space . 
 the electromagnetic effects are not modeled by lorentz group elements but by the new aspects of the five dimensional coordinate system . 
 the gedanken experiment of section  ( [ ecq ] ) supports this interpretation . within the interaction region of figure  ( [ f1 ] ) , 
 five dimensional effects occur which cause a deflection of the particle relative to the unvarying neutral geodesics . once free from the interaction , and arriving at @xmath22 , 
 the integrated effects of the electromagnetic field leave a residual velocity @xmath45 that is distinct in ontology from the neutral velocity @xmath46 . 
 this is implicitly defined by the orientation of the five dimensional system , which has an internal geometrical distortion that is not represented in neutral space - time . 
 this integrated effect persists outside of the interaction region . 
 it can , in fact , describe aharonov - bohm type effects . 
 the velocity of the charged particle can not be reduced to the velocity of the neutral particle by a space - time lorentz transformation . 
 a similar discussion can be made for a fixed gauge weyl theory . 
 the charge particle motion is varied by the non - riemannian part of the connections which are outside the range of space - time lorentz transformations . 
 an important property of this description of a quantum state is that there is no formal identification of the mass . 
 moreover , various different field values @xmath25 can correspond to the motion of a particle having possibly continuously varying value . 
 there is no inertial frame because arbitrary transformations are allowed . 
 the motion is inertia free . 
 this mathematical concept of motion is important to allow the resolution of the very different concepts of inertia that prevail for the interactions studied . 
 the relation between the physical inertia and its numerical representation is not the same for classical , quantum , and gravitational theories . for gravity , 
 inertial effects are independent of the value of the mass , as long as it is nonzero . 
 electromagnetism has a characteristic @xmath47 value and quantum mechanics scales inversely .    for conventional derivations of quantum mechanics , 
 the inertial properties of particles are assumed to be intrinsic and are eventually introduced through the classical hamiltonian or lagrangian . 
 this , prevents the identification of the mass with the field equations . 
 this epistemology must be changed in a geometrical construction . 
 the inertia is fundamental and originates with the quantum processes of diffraction and interference . 
 these effects must come from the quantum geometrical system without the intervention of classical physics . 
 measurement of the inertia of a particle must be considered fundamentally quantum . 
 the classical observation is the good fortune of a simple experiment . 
 it is in reality a measure of the ratio of the compton wavelength of the test particle to one or more compton wavelengths in the measuring apparatus . in the classical limit , 
 the diffraction effects become negligible and inertia , as is classically understood , remains . 
 the observation of inertia depends on having quantum stabilized dimensional standards . 
 the observers coordinate system must be calibrated in a consistent , systematic manner  @xcite . 
 even the elementary demonstration of newton using a bucket of water or spheres connected by a cord refers to sized objects . 
 a single length standard is represented by a standard clock that is quantum based and measures in terms of @xmath48 . 
 a bouncing light beam clock requires that the mirrors be held at an absolute space - like distance . 
 an apparatus to hold the mirrors must be built with atoms , or other quantum objects of constant size determined equivalently by values of @xmath49 . 
 the only alternative time scale is one based on the planck length . 
 the relationship is addressed in the work of dirac and others on large numbers  @xcite . 
 it is supposed here that the planck length may be cosmological rather than fundamental . 
 the relationship of the planck clock to the atomic clock remains a goal of theoretical and experimental research  @xcite . 
 it is assumed that the fine structure constant @xmath50 is an invariant and that any of the time scales which can be formed by @xmath51 are the same . 
 for such situations as @xmath50 might be allowed to vary , @xmath52 is taken as the fundamental quantity . 
 other interactions , weak and strong , are presumed unessential to chronometry . 
 figure  ( [ f2 ] ) shows a quantum clock that avoids these problems and provides a theoretical time standard .    because the mass is taken out of the classical arena 
 , the phenomenology of spacelike measurements must be carefully reconsidered . 
 the accepted construction is shown in figure  ( [ f3 ] ) . 
 two particles intersect two spacelike separated points @xmath53 and @xmath54 . 
 a light beam is sent from particle @xmath55 at time @xmath56 to particle @xmath57 so that it arrives at @xmath58 . the beam is immediately returned to particle @xmath55 arriving at time @xmath59 . 
 the distance @xmath60 is to be inferred from the measured delays @xmath56 and @xmath59 . 
 if , however , the particle @xmath55 is described by quantum mechanics , conventional theory proposes that the trajectory is ambiguously defined if it is defined at all . 
 it may in fact be thought to intersect the @xmath61 axis anywhere between @xmath54 and @xmath62 , which are the relativistically allowed limits . 
 the distance @xmath63 can no longer be measured . 
 this is a serious metaphysical failure . 
 even a practical analysis shows that the observational determination of a macroscopic observer s metric for a particular coordinate system can only be done if the experimental system is sufficiently large to be treated classically  @xcite . because of this failure 
 , the classical construction must be replaced if a fundamental sense of space - time is to be maintained . 
 the assumed classical geodesy must be considered a phenomenological result . 
 following mach  @xcite , attempts have been made to associate inertia with gravitational forces by the action of distant objects  @xcite . from the second order calculation made by thirring  @xcite , it is known that there is an effect on inertia . because it is not possible to manipulate the distant objects experimentally , 
 the choice between using a relative concept of inertia and an absolute concept is probably to be made by mathematical convenience . 
 the inertia free description of the five dimensional system can accomplish this . 
 the usual absence of first order structure is remedied by the fixed gauge construction . 
 the boundary conditions of mach may then be supplied by the standard quantum ( or hamilton - jacobi ) boundary conditions . 
 the resulting fixed gauge system has the mathematical capacity to incorporate a fundamental construction of inertia .    with three fields 
 , there will be three corresponding sets of boundary conditions . 
 electromagnetic radiation(and the implied acceleration ) is to be related to boundary conditions defined by an external absorber . 
 gravitational radiation is analogous but more complicated . and for quantum mechanics , the sense of inertia implied by the eigenstates is determined by the space - time boundary conditions . 
 the separation of these effects may depend on the particular choice of a neutral physical space - time . 
 the quantum aspects are the more important lowest order effects . 
 electromagnetic effects , when separated from quantum effects , are first order and gravitational forces are second order . 
 this supports generally the modern ideas that relate inertia to electromagnetic fields . 
 the study of the properties of a quantum congruence shows the importance of quantum boundary conditions for the expression of inertia . 
 consider , as sketched in figure  ( [ f4 ] ) , an experiment consisting of particles that traverse a series of unaligned apertures . 
 a certain fraction will diffract through each hole in turn and finally be detected . 
 these can not be said to move on a classical trajectory . 
 moreover , the number of apertures can be increased indefinitely as long as the they are not too small and the particles are not required to have unattainable velocities . 
 otherwise , the trajectories are nearly arbitrary . 
 the loss of particle counts is not important and is actually caused by implied absorptive boundary conditions . rather than 
 have the particles hit the screens , each aperture could be connected to the previous one by a small tube upon which the wave function is set to zero . in either case , the motion is convoluted but does not require external classical fields . if @xmath64 be chosen everywhere tangent to the probability current density , the five dimensional fixed gauge congruence can describe this motion . by adjusting the five dimensional `` cut '' coordinate transformation to align the vector potential with the local current , a quantum particle can be followed as it traverses the experiment . 
 the five dimensional geometry is sufficient to describe elementary quantum motion . 
 fundamental quantum inertia is the constraint put on the trajectories by the geometry as external forces or boundary conditions are applied through the field equations . 
 these should be constructed from invariants  @xcite . 
 all of this requires more formalism . 
 because the trajectories of charged particles are not straight lines with respect to a neutral frame , curvilinear coordinates are required . this elementary picture , that uses straight trajectory segments must be expanded into a full structure capable of describing complex motion . 
 the particle congruence , as a mathematical representation of a physical object , admits five dimensional coordinate transformations analogous with the four dimensional lorentz transformations . these can be used to construct and interpret five dimensional metric tensors . 
 to first order , a differential vector @xmath65 , in a coordinate system @xmath66 , will be mapped linearly onto a differential vector @xmath67 in a coordinate system @xmath68 . in this approximation , @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath21 and @xmath71 must satisfy integrability conditions . 
 the coefficient @xmath72 describes a local conformal transformation for space - time . 
 if @xmath72 is constrained to unity , conformal effects are removed from the coordinate transformation . 
 the case @xmath73 is useful to eliminate @xmath12 dependence when it is present . 
 the coefficient @xmath74 may be at most indirectly observed because it involves the normalization of @xmath12 over extended space - time . 
 the remaining coefficient @xmath75 produces quantum and electromagnetic effects . 
 the invariance properties of this term have been studied by klein and others  @xcite . 
 it is usually identified as an invariant gauge transformation . in a fixed gauge theory , it operates on the particle state and changes the velocity , mass , and effective wave function . 
 it is an integral part of the extended principle of equivalence . 
 this last term is best studied separately by examining the shear transformation . 
 @xmath76 @xmath77 which becomes @xmath78 @xmath79 and where the coefficient @xmath80 must always be exact . 
 the transformed five metric is calculated directly from the invariance of the line element . @xmath81 giving @xmath82    the local five - lorentz transformations 
 can also be calculated from @xmath83 which gives @xmath84 and again demonstrates the shear character .    in five dimensions 
 , two gauge coefficients may be present rather than the single gauge factor @xmath85 of the weyl theory . to make the transition from neutral space , 
 it is necessary to write , in the most general case , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath85 can both be functions of position . 
 the ratio @xmath88 can no longer be treated as one gauge function . 
 when @xmath89 , the factors have distinct effects since there are off diagonal terms in @xmath90 . if such a conformal transformation is applied as a point transformation it changes the physical fields . 
 in addition there is possibly an overall conformal multiplier @xmath91 . 
 these factors do not affect the projection of the congruence onto space - time . 
 they must either be invariance transformations or else must change the identities of the physical fields that accompany the motion . 
 the application of the conformal transformations along with the extended lorentz transformations generates a more complicated single particle metric from neutral space . 
 @xmath92 setting @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 this metric becomes @xmath96 the new quantity @xmath97 is not in general integrable and can be associated with the electromagnetic field . 
 this metric is a generalization of the standard kaluza - klein form . 
 the conformal transformations have been joined with the coordinate transformations to allow the generation of quantum and electromagnetic effects . 
 the resulting five metric , expressed in terms of fixed gauge quantities , is distinct from the conventional kaluza - klein theory because it represents the microphysics of a single quantum particle . 
 it is a quantum object , not by any process of quantization , but by the fixed gauge assumption and the inherent quantum nature of geometry .    because these conformal factors do not change the direction of @xmath44 , the five dimensional null geodesics of section  [ fxg ] generalize immediately to the same trajectories proposed by the quantum - weyl theory  @xcite . 
 external interactions including the electromagnetic source terms presumably can be characterized by combinations of the conformal factors @xmath87 , @xmath85 , and @xmath91 . 
 it is the transformation of source terms implied by changes in conformal factors that is an essential part of extended equivalence . by setting different conformal factors ( as observed from the neutral space ) different mechanistic combinations of electromagnetic , quantum and gravitational effects 
 can be ascribed to a given congruence . 
 the subtleties of the existence of a killing vector are now more apparent . 
 each point of the congruence is equivalent as far as simple motion is concerned . 
 if however , the particular metric coefficients ( that are the expressed determining influence of that motion ) are included , each point can have different local external fields . 
 when constructing an arbitrary vector potential from a gradient , a single integrating factor may not always exist . in this case , a more complex approach to interaction is necessary . 
 a complete physical determination awaits a set of quantum - einstein - maxwell source equations . 
 for a single external source particle , the integrating factor can be found in the rest frame of the source . for multiple source particles 
 , additivity fails and a more involved analysis is needed . 
 it is conjectured that the requirement of multiple integrating factors is naturally satisfied by the use of multiple source particles . 
 the geodesic system of section  ( [ fxg ] ) , describing classical motion , can be applied directly to the quantum case . from standard theory , 
 it is known that the klein - gordon conserved current in fixed gauge form is @xmath98 this defines a congruence for a solution of the quantum field equation . 
 it is to be associated with one or more 5-metrics . 
 the trajectories are to be defined by a first order fixed gauge equation , in form identical to the classical case . 
 the changing length of @xmath44 is now essential to the quantum and electrodynamic observations . 
 a modified normalization can be defined by @xmath99 . 
 let the factor @xmath100 be chosen so that @xmath101 . 
 this starred vector potential can be used to define a trajectory with a parameter @xmath33 that is entirely analogous to the classical case except that @xmath102 is not a solution of maxwell s equations . @xmath103 
 the @xmath104 dependence can be chosen to keep the five displacement null .    from the arguments of section  ( [ tfd ] ) 
 it is expected that an appropriate five dimensional metric is of the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are fixed gauge quantum fields . to show that these are geodesics , 
 a coordinate transformation can be defined by @xmath108 . 
 this choice depends on the particular congruence . 
 it is not integrable generally but can be chosen uniquely by executing the integration along the congruence . 
 choosing @xmath109 , the five dimensional metric now becomes @xmath110 and has the same form as the classical theories . 
 it must have geodesics as given by  ( [ qntgeo ] ) . 
 these are quantum geodesics because the motion they predict gives a correct description of statistical measurements of quantum states in combined gravitational and electromagnetic fields . they are tangent to the accepted probability density current in space - time . by the argument of section  ( [ fxg ] ) , 
 the observed second order equation can be found by taking the absolute derivative of the quantum trajectory relative to the observers metric @xmath111 . 
 this gives @xmath112    quantum forces are included by way of the rescaled vector potential . 
 the particle motion is always tangent to @xmath44 but the second order derivatives are attributed to different physical fields by the measuring process . 
 resubstituting @xmath113 , @xmath114 = \nonumber \\ { e \over m } \dot g^{\mu\lambda } \left ( { \partial a_\beta \over \partial x^\lambda}- { \partial a_\lambda \over \partial x^\beta}\right ) { dx^\lambda \over dw}+ \dot g^{\mu\beta}(\xi_\lambda a_\nu - \xi_\beta a_\lambda ) { dx^\lambda \over dw}+ { e \over m } \dot g^{\mu\beta}(\xi-1 ) \left ( { \partial a_\beta \over \partial x^\lambda}- { \partial a_\lambda \over \partial x^\beta } \right){dx^\lambda \over dw}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the first term on the left is the acceleration of the particle and the second includes all classical gravitational and fictious ( inertial ) forces . 
 the right hand side splits into three parts . 
 the first is the conventional electromagnetic force . 
 the second and third are quantum forces which can be named respectively convected and parametric because of the dependence on the factor @xmath115 . 
 the representation is of the motion of a single quantum particle interacting through fields alone . with this formalism , it is easy to see that an electron diffraction pattern should be distorted smoothly by an external field , either electromagnetic or gravitational . 
 much like the null four geodesics of light beams , the null five geodesics do not change under an overall conformal transformation . 
 the first order defining equation for a quantum geodesic can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath40 is not in general affine . 
 the above result still holds because the derivative of the projected trajectory is made by the observer in terms of the neutral space metric . 
 the path parameter @xmath117 , normalized by @xmath5 , is used to display the apparent acceleration of the inferred four - velocity of the particle . 
 the overall conformal invariance can be used to provide an additional demonstration that the probability current is directed along null five geodesics . 
 one can consider a particular factor @xmath118 such that it is the integrating factor of the electromagnetic vector potential . 
 as before let @xmath119 for some scalar @xmath120 and factor @xmath121 . in addition , the fifth coordinate can be transformed by @xmath122 using again the integration along the congruence . 
 the metric after the transformation is @xmath123 and gives after the cut transformation @xmath124 the diagonal form @xmath125    again , more than one conformal - coordinate transformation may be needed to integrate the vector potential . 
 geodesics of this diagonal metric include the point solutions @xmath126 that satisfy @xmath127 . 
 these transform to the initial geodesics by the inverse of the above sequence . 
 the residual factor @xmath128 contains information on interactions and probability densities . in this coordinate system , each geodesic is represented by one point which is apparently the hidden variable . 
 this point can be fixed at a certain value of the proper time relative to an arbitrary initial surface . 
 the entire past and future history of the particle congruence can be calculated from the five metric by integrating along geodesics in five - space . for 
 given determining external fields , the intersection point of this trajectory with a particular space like surface can be found . 
 each possible particle position measurement can be thought to result from one geodesic in the collected congruence . 
 the congruence as a whole represents the motion generated by the specific given quantum state . 
 a few comments may clarify the issue of hidden variables . 
 it is necessary because in a fundamentally geometric theory , it may be essential to describe particles with geodesics . such specific identification of point particle motion is adverse to conventional interpretations of quantum mechanics . 
 a complete critical discussion of the standard objections to hidden variable theories is outside the scope of this paper . 
 when precisely applied , the usual objections are valid for many alternate theories 
 . some of these alternate theories may also disagree with experiment or may have some mathematical error . 
 overall , there is no generally accepted way of avoiding the objections to hidden variables . 
 for the purposes of this article it is sufficient to point out a class of geometrical theories that are not subject to the accepted objections . 
 one of the most serious practical problems is that an assumption of the existence of hidden variables provides no guidance as to how to find them . under these circumstances , 
 the question of definition is most important . 
 it is usually supposed that any reasonable choice would be derived from the classical theory through the system of observables constructed by von - neumann  @xcite . 
 this is not the case here . 
 the mathematics of differential geometry substitutes an inequivalent fundamental structure . since the quantum system is not to be derived from classical physics , the use of differential operators as physical concepts is not required . for the geometrical theories of this paper , classical mechanics 
 is fully rejected as a fundamental theory . 
 the conditions of von neumann s theorem fail because the hidden variables no longer have to be defined according to his prescription . 
 while de broglie s hidden variable concept ,  @xcite , is still popular in the minds of many physicists  @xcite , his use of the operator substitution method allows von neumann s argument to prevail . 
 this suppressive theorem can be applied when the derivative as a representative of the physical momentum is presumed to be a legal substitution into the equations of classical mechanics .    without bare physical operators , all physical quantities commute , and 
 von neumann s theorem is avoided . 
 the concept of the classical canonical momentum matched with the analogous operator oriented quantum concept fail together . 
 there is no quantum measurement theory in the usual sense . 
 it is worth noting that if a quantum theory is defined by a system of differential equations alone , then there is no unambiguous way to define the canonical momentum . 
 all classical theory is avoided . 
 the process of operator substitution has no mathematical precedent and no accepted mathematical justification . 
 the metaphysics of quantization fails and the arguments of von neumann may not hold . 
 first quantization , in actuality , serves the purpose of recreating differential factors that are neglected in the phenomenological perception of classical mechanics . 
 it is an essential method in an historical context . 
 all of the accepted derivations ,  @xcite , of the klein - gordon equation , except possibly the one by klein , proceed along these lines . 
 thus the geometrical view presented here is fundamentally different . 
 it is not a reformulation and new results are possible . in particular , 
 the capability to address gravitational problems is added over the conventional wisdom . 
 the rejection of first quantization may have effects that extend beyond immediate considerations . 
 the repeated circular derivation of quantum from classical and then classical from quantum is implicit in much of modern physics . 
 this cyclic logic should be broken at the point of first quantization . 
 geometrical theories or any other new theory may need to be evaluated against experiment and not current phenomenology . 
 modern criticism of alternative quantum theories and hidden variables usually is presented in the context of bell s theorem  @xcite . 
 comparisons of theory and experiment have been found to support the conventional formalism . 
 a number of measured results  @xcite lie outside the predictions of a large class of alternate theories . 
 bell s theorem is motivated partly from the work of von neumann . 
 the accepted quantum discussion depends on the use of operators as physical quantities and neglects relativistic effects . 
 a careful consideration of the assumptions and arguments of bell s theorem shows under what conditions alternate constructions might be mathematically possible and experimentally acceptable .    a serious weakness of bell s analysis centers around the approximations that are necessary to make a manifestly relativistic or covariant theory non - relativistic . 
 when applied to alternate theories , bell s objections depend on the presence of an implied classical basis . 
 this has subtle implications that become part of the quantum interpretation . 
 moreover , the wave function is hypothesized without any predecessor . 
 better that the wave function should be part of a geometrical space and not an esoteric representation of some sort of fundamental statistical essence . 
 in addition , some of the classical properties appended during quantization , especially those relating to causality , are misleading and inappropriate . 
 radiation is manifestly relativistic and the mathematics and sense of causality that deal with it should be covariant . 
 the justification of the use of a nonrelativistic limit for radiation comes only from classical physics . 
 it is this metaphysics of motion in a relativistic field that causes trouble . 
 it is known that bell s theorem can not be applied to a theory like quantum electrodynamics wherein advanced potentials are used . 
 such fields , while undesirable in a classical theory , are not forbidden by any concept of fundamental geometry . a fully covariant geometrical theory in which advanced fields are implicit 
 , may be capable of predicting the non - local results typical of photon correlation experiments . 
 conversely it is not possible to derive a non - relativistic quantum mechanics from either quantum electrodynamics or geometrical theory without serious conceptual compromises . 
 the implications of such classically imposed causality are subtle . for a fully microscopically deterministic theory , an experiment with _ 
 complete _ arbitrary initial conditions ( in the sense of the einstein , rosen , and podolsky  @xcite ) is not apriori possible . 
 it is believed that almost any experiment can be done , but only a the small number of initial conditions allowed by the current state of the universe are possible . 
 the temperature of the experiment must be greater than the ambient noise . 
 any experiment , because of electromagnetic radiation and distant gravitational interaction may connect with particles at the farthest reaches , past and future . our sense of causality is a large scale observation of these events . a microscopic electromagnetic field that does or does not go backwards in time 
 can only be included or excluded in so far as it does or does not explain scientific experience . 
 moreover , since the microscopic structure of quantum mechanics does not have an intrinsic direction , formal symmetry between advanced and retarded potentials must be possible .    for a photon correlation experiment , 
 the calculation using the propagators of quantum electrodynamics has essential terms with advanced dependency . because of implicit instantaneous interactions , non - relativistic quantum mechanics implies the use of such fields but also _ represses any explicit reference to them_. since bell s theorem requires that all fields be retarded , the conclusions of this theorem are avoided for quantum systems . even an implicit advanced interaction voids bell s theorem . 
 it is still unknown , whether in a more complete theory , the presence of advanced potentials must be explicitly displayed or whether they are an artifact of the mathematical methods . because of the demonstration by experiment 
 , such interactions must be integrated into the theory despite the counter - intuitive indications of classical physics . 
 it is easy to show that the common geometrical theories already contain advanced potentials . 
 since a congruence of motion is to be well defined , it must represent all physical effects . 
 in particular , the force of radiative reaction must be included . 
 this must be introduced into the vector potential by the advanced potentials of other interacting particles . 
 the final overall prediction need not be interpreted as an advanced propagation of information or energy . 
 a fixed gauge system that includes all electromagnetic forces must be exempt from bell s theorem . 
 the relationship of geometrical theories to these accepted experiments is important . 
 most measurements use photon correlations . for the present development of the geometrical description 
 there is no reason to consider calculations which are not equivalent to quantum electrodynamics . 
 the geometrically preferred scheme is to use time symmetric potentials without free fields . 
 theoretical predictions of this type have already been shown to agree with the standard versions  @xcite . 
 the experiment by aspect is representative of this class and is straightforward to analyze . a limitation to retarded potentials 
 is not required . for a two photon correlated emission 
 , the emitting atom can not execute the state transition without the presence of the simultaneous advanced electrodynamic fields from two or more absorbing particles  @xcite . 
 the correlation can be observed only if the experiment is arranged so that both emitted photons are collected in the experiment rather than in other parts of the universe . 
 there are also correlation experiments that involve particles . in the case where the interaction between the particles is mediated by electromagnetic fields 
 , the elementary geometrical theory should be sufficient . 
 the nuclear experiments that use spin polarization  @xcite give important results for weak and strong interactions . 
 formal predictions for these fields are not possible because the geometrical structure used here is insufficient . physically , though it is possible to argue that the results are not incongruent 
 . the use of advanced potentials for other fields should be adequate to predict the observed result . 
 in particular , the effects of spin during scattering do not seem to be time asymmetric . 
 these results should be explainable using the nuclear equivalent of time symmetric potentials . 
 the principle of equivalence is expected to have further extensions so that even spin couplings are replaced by the effects of covariant geometrical fields . 
 the entanglement of multiparticle states is assumed to be the integrated effect of the physical interaction that causes the state to form . 
 the entangled states described early by schrdinger ,  @xcite , that are so characteristic of quantum mechanics are interpreted as a persistent geometrical distortion that is inseparable from the interaction that connects the particles . 
 time symmetric electrodynamics , developed as a classical theory  @xcite must be modified to allow for quantum effects . 
 the macroscopic classical approximation must be the limit of the quantum mechanical transitions that really occur . 
 the use of the classical theory as the metaphysical precursor of the quantum field leads to confusion . 
 this sort of quantum electrodynamics has been applied to cosmological situations  @xcite . 
 therein , the quantization of time symmetric electrodynamics ,  @xcite is based on classical physics . the unusual predicted results with respect to absorption and emission seem to be due to the assumptions of those classical properties before the quantization is accomplished . the confusion is related to the similarity of classical electrodynamics to possible primitive geometrical forms of electrodynamics . 
 a precise notion of classical absorption or emission can not be defined until the fundamental processes of discrete quantum absorption or emission are understood . 
 more recent experiments on quantum electrodynamics support the concept that the pre - quantization assumption of absorption and emission is not be justified  @xcite . 
 a number of important issues are raised by the application of covariant geodesics to quantum particles . 
 this possibility is not part of the accepted formulation of quantum theory . 
 it is of some interest because the fundamental construction is simpler than other quantum gravitational theories . 
 the real issue is whether the use of such a construction can produce the essential results and complex phenomenology of modern quantum experiments . 
 this article specifies how to begin such a theory and how the usual hard objections to trajectories can be avoided .    the conformal parameters and their relation to source terms are an important development . 
 the conformal transformations take a place with the coordinate transformations as a means of generating a principle of equivalence . 
 the usual curvilinear transformations allow the interchange of gravitational and inertial forces . 
 the quantum and electrodynamic forces are now to be included . 
 the conformal factors are essential for the description in the frame of the neutral observer . 
 these are also important in the study of the field equations that begins in a following article . 
 a number of concepts have been developed which allow the description of quantum phenomena to be done with differential geometry . 
 the application is to the combined effects of gravity , electromagnetism and quantum mechanics without weak or strong interactions . 
 a number of currently accepted beliefs are discounted , particularly those concerning the epistemology of quantum mechanics and the metaphysical basis of general relativity . a new way of thinking about these fields of physics is devised . 
 the general theory of relativity must be treated as a phenomenological result of a deeper theory . 
 the quantum mechanical theory must not be derived from classical physics . 
 a fundamental geometrical electrodynamics is introduced . 
 the actual fifth dimension is associated with the proper time of charged , isolated , point particles of finite mass . 
 dependence on the fifth parameter is not apparent to a real observer because the physical laws , when expressed in five dimensional form , predict precisely what would be expected according to common observation . 
 the proper values of the fifth coordinate of a particle are not absolutely determinate but are only defined differentially and with a gauge factor that is not observable . 
 this approach might be called kinematic dimensional reduction . 
 the classical principle of equivalence is extended . 
 this concept , required by the fundamental notion of trajectory motion , provides a guide for mathematical development . 
 an extension of the geometry either as to the number of dimensions or the use of non - riemannian effects is required . 
 the distinction between the effect of the three fields on a primitive particle is only defined after the relation between the particle and a neutral space - time observer is specified . 
 fixed gauge methods are used . 
 the individual geometrical fields , are not subject to the variability of most common gauge transformations . 
 the vector potential represents both the velocity of the particle and the relationship of the five space to space - time . 
 null geodesics are everywhere tangent to the associated probability current and can represent a quantum state . 
 the usual problems with von neumann s theorem and bell s theorem are avoided . 
 the geometrical theories are in agreement with experimental results that have been found to limit other alternate quantum theories . 
 the implications for a five dimensional geometrical theories are profound and extensive .

25,"extrasolar planetary host stars are well known to display systematic enrichments in many elements , including several key terrestrial planet forming elements such as fe , mg , si and o ( e.g. @xcite ) . 
 furthermore , a wide range in host star photospheric mg / si and c / o values . 
 ] has been observed @xcite . 
 the ratios of mg / si and c / o are critical for planetary systems as they determine the bulk mineralogy of the solid , planet forming material present within the disk , thus also controlling the composition of any terrestrial planets present within the system . 
 assuming equilibrium conditions , a c / o value greater than 0.8 implies that si will exist in the solid form as sic , with additional c also present . 
 for c / o values less than 0.8 , silicates are produced with either the sio@xmath0@xmath1 or sio@xmath2 building block . 
 the exact composition of these silicates is controlled by the mg / si value , ranging from pyroxene ( mgsio@xmath3 ) and various feldspars ( for mg / si@xmath41 ) , to a combination of pyroxene and olivine ( mg@xmath2sio@xmath0 ) ( for 1@xmath4mg / si@xmath42 ) and finally to olivine with other mgo or mgs species ( for mg / si@xmath52 ) . 
 note that for reference , the solar mg / si value is 1.05 @xcite , while the bulk earth mg / si value is 1.02 @xcite , resulting in planets composed of both olivine and pyroxene . 
 the observed variations in these key ratios for known planetary host stars implies that a wide variety of extrasolar terrestrial planet compositions are likely to exist , ranging from relatively  earth - like "" planets to those that are dominated by c as graphite and carbide phases ( e.g. sic , tic ) @xcite . 
 previous studies have examined several possible terrestrial planet compositions based upon stellar photospheric abundances @xcite . 
 recent work by @xcite has shown that a significant fraction of host stars ( 56% ) may have a mg / si value less than 1 . 
 such compositions have not been previously simulated and are expected to differ significantly from that of earth . given the large errors associated with photospheric mg / si ( and c / o ) values , the true fraction of host stars with mg / si values below 1 is likely to be less than 56% . 
 however , it is not expected to be negligible , implying that a significant number of terrestrial extrasolar planets may have compositions unlike that of earth .    in this letter we present the results of simulations of terrestrial planet formation within three extrasolar planetary systems with stellar abundances determined by @xcite to have mg / si values less than 1 
 the focus of this letter is a new region of mg / si and c / o space that was not previously occupied by any known planetary host stars , hence the very specific limitations of the simulations conducted here . 
 the systems studied highlight the main chemical differences between these systems and those previously studied . 
 we adopt the same approach as used in @xcite , combining dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation with chemical equilibrium models of the composition of solid material within the disk . 
 this is the first study to consider terrestrial planets of this nature , assisting in developing our understanding of the full spectrum of possible extrasolar terrestrial planet commotions . 
 three known extrasolar planetary systems with mg / si values less than 1 were selected for this study . 
 each of the three systems was previously simulated by @xcite with different stellar abundances . 
 the stellar elemental abundance values of @xcite were utilized in this study as they are the first to determine the abundance of all of the required elements in a completely internally consistent manner ( high quality spectra and identical approach for all stars and elements ) for a large sample of both host and non - host stars . 
 it should be noted that although one system selected for study here ( 55cnc ) was not observed as part of the harps sample , it was observed as part of the coralie survey . 
 spectral analysis was completed in the same fashion as for all other harps target stars , thus maintaining the consistency of the methodology applied here . 
 instrument variation is not thought to have introduced significant error . 
 all three systems were previously found to have mg / si values greater than 1 and c / o values above 0.8 ( based on @xcite ) ( see table [ input_chem ] for both previous and current mg / si and c / o values ) . 
 abundance variations are understood to be due to differences in atomic and stellar parameters used , expanded line lists and improved equivalent width measurements . 
 of the three systems to be studied here , two host stars were found by @xcite to have c / o values less than 0.8 ( hd17051 and hd19994 ) , while one host star ( 55cnc ) has a c / o value well above 0.8 . 
 this range in c / o values was purposefully chosen to examine the full range of planetary compositions possible with mg / si values below 1 . 
 as with all such abundance studies , the error bars associated with these values are large and can not be minimized with current techniques . with this sample 
 , we are also examining a variety of planetary system architectures . both hd17051 ( hr810 , hip12653 , iota hor ) and hd19994 have a single known giant planetary companion with masses slightly larger than that of jupiter ( 2.26m@xmath6 , a=0.925au , e=0.161 and 1.7m@xmath6 , a=1.42au , e=0.3 , respectively ) . on the other hand , 55cnc ( hd75732 ) 
 has five known planetary companions ( 4 inner planets with a@xmath70.781au and one outer planet with a=5.76au ) with masses ranging from 3.84m@xmath6 down to 0.03m@xmath6 ( 8.58m@xmath8 ) .      in this study 
 , we utilized the same approach as in @xcite . 
 the composition of solid material within the disk is assumed to be in equilibrium with the primordial stellar nebula . 
 consequently , equilibrium condensation sequences can be used as a proxy to determine the final elemental composition of the simulated terrestrial planets . following @xcite , condensation sequences for the 16 major solid forming elements ( h , c , n 
 , o , na , mg , al , si , p , s , ca , ti , cr , fe and ni ) were obtained using hsc chemistry ( v. 5.1 ) and are based upon the gibbs energy minimization method . 
 stellar photospheric abundances of fe , mg , si , c , o , ni ( from @xcite ) , na , al , ca , ti and cr ( derived in this work using the linelist from @xcite ) were utilized as the composition of the stellar nebula . 
 these abundances were determined in a uniform , internally consistent manner , thus reducing any possible systematic errors within the sample . 
 abundances of n , p and s were approximated based on the odd - even effect . 
 the increased stability of even atomic number nuclei results in a higher occurrence of these species when compared to odd atomic number nuclei , producing the well known saw tooth pattern in solar abundances . 
 there is no reason to think that this same trend would not hold for extrasolar planetary host stars . 
 thus by fitting a linear trend through the odd and even atomic number nuclei separately for solar abundances we were able to approximate the abundance of n , p and s based on the observed abundances of c , al and si ( respectively ) . 
 the input values used in hsc chemistry ( normalized to 10@xmath9 si atoms ) for each system are shown in table [ input_chem ] . in order to provide a spatial location within the disk for a given composition , 
 radial pressure and temperature profiles from @xcite were applied . 
 disk conditions at a evolutionary time of t = 5@xmath1010@xmath11yr are utilized here as they were found to produce the best fit to known planetary values within the solar system @xcite . 
 for more detail on this method , the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite . 
 numerous simulations of terrestrial planet formation have been conducted , focussing on aspects such as disk mass and viscosity @xcite , giant planet migration @xcite and orbital parameters @xcite . for this study 
 , we utilized the n - body simulations of late - stage terrestrial planet accretion of @xcite . 
 these simulations are intended to be indicative of the types of terrestrial planets that may form within the systems selected , not be inclusive of all aspects of planet formation . 
 four simulations were completed for each system . 
 each simulation was run using the symba n - body integrator @xcite with orbital parameters of the giant planets taken from the catalog of @xcite ( updated from exoplanets.org ) . 
 an initial population of lunar - to mars - mass embryos was distributed between 0.3 au from the host star and the known giant planet ( in the case of 55cnc , embryos were distributed between the inner and outer planets ) in accordance with the embryo mass , spacing and orbital radius relations of @xcite and following the mmsn solid surface density . as we are currently only considering late - stage accretion , 
 migration is neglected in the current simulations . for more details 
 , please refer to @xcite . 
 giant planet migration is expected to alter the composition of the terrestrial planet feeding zones , thus also changing the composition of the final terrestrial planet . 
 simulations incorporating this effect are currently ongoing .      as in previous work , 
 the chemical and dynamical simulations were combined together by assuming each embryo retains the composition of its formation location and contributes the same composition to the simulated terrestrial planet . in this approach , 
 phase changes and outgassing are neglected . following the method of the dynamical simulations , 
 all collisions are assumed to result in a perfect merger ( i.e. no mass was lost from either the target body or the impactor during impact ) . 
 a schematic of the resulting bulk elemental compositions of the simulated terrestrial planets are shown in figures [ allpie1 ] and [ allpie2 ] . 
 note that these compositions were produced using the radial disk profiles at t = 5@xmath1010@xmath11yr as previously discussed . 
 these same results are shown numerically in table [ results ] . 
 all of the terrestrial planets considered here have compositions dominated by o , fe , mg and si with most of these elements being delivered in the form of silicates or metals ( in the case of iron ) . 
 however , important differences between those planets forming in systems with c / o@xmath40.8 ( hd17051 , hd19994 ) and those with c / o@xmath50.8 ( 55cnc ) can be seen . 
 although all of the simulated planets are composed of mg - silicates and fe , only 2 of 7 simulated planets for hd17051 and 1 of 7 simulated planets for hd19994 contains sufficient mg to be classed as  earth - like "" . 
 note that here an 
 earth - like "" planet does not mean that a planet is identical in compositional identical earth . 
 rather , it has a broadly similar composition , consisting of mg silicates and metallic fe with other species present in relatively minor amounts and with a maximum deviation of @xmath1225% from the elemental abundances for the earth listed in @xcite for the major elements ( o , fe , mg , si ) . 
 this variation limit was selected so that both venus and mars would be considered to be  earth - like "" in composition . 
 all other planets produced in hd17051 and hd19994 are considered to be mg - depleted silicate planets . 
 furthermore , as in prior simulations , radial variations can be seen for those simulations producing multiple terrestrial planets ( 3 simulations for hd17051 , 2 simulations for hd19994 ) . in these cases , 
 the innermost terrestrial planets ( located within @xmath130.5 au from the host star ) contain a significant amount of the refractory elements al and ca ( @xmath1347% of the planetary mass ) . 
 planets forming beyond @xmath130.5 au from the host star contain steadily less al and ca with increasing distance . with the inclusion of giant planet migration in future simulations 
 , it is expected that this radial compositional gradient will diminish , leaving us with essentially an averaged composition more closely resembling that of earth . however , for the current simulations and with the exception of the three  earth - like "" planets previously mentioned , these systems can be described as producing refractory - enriched silicate planets for the interior planets and mg - depleted silicate planets for the outermost planets . 
 none of the planets accrete any water or other hydrous phases in these simulations due to their distance from the snow line and narrow feeding zones . 
 only 1 system studied here has a c / o ratio above 1 ( 55cnc , c / o = 1.12 ) . 
 this system produced carbon - enriched  earth - like "" planets , based on the above definition . 
 although the system is predicted to contain a region between approximately 0.46 and 1.48au in which the solid composition is almost exclusively c ( present as graphite , sic and tic ) , all of the simulated planets formed outside of this region ( between 1.6 and 3.6au ) due to the inner planets of this system . 
 thus , instead of being dominated by c phases , the planetary feeding zones contained both c and significant amounts of other mg silicates ( such as pyroxene ) . 
 as such , the simulated planets are earth - like in their bulk compositions , with c contents ranging from @xmath40.01 wt% to 11 wt% . 
 this implies that the innermost giant planets should contain significant amounts of c as they lie well within this c - dominant zone ( assuming that they also formed in or close to their current orbits or sourced a significant amount of material from this region ) . 
 additionally , given that the location of this c - rich zone varies with time as the disk cools , simulations using a different radial pressure and temperature profile may produce c - rich terrestrial planets . 
 likewise , the planets simulated within the 55cnc system are enriched in s compared to the hd17051 and hd19994 . 
 this is not due to s enrichment within the system itself but rather due to the feeding zones for the simulated planets being further from the host star and thus cool enough to contain s in the solid form ( primarily as fes ) . 
 giant planet migration is expected to drastically alter this marked radial variation in composition and is the focus of current simulations . as in the other two systems , all of the simulated planets within 55cnc form ` dry ' in that they do not accrete any hydrous phases .      although detections have been made of planets with masses as low as 2m@xmath8 , we are still yet to detect planets with masses @xmath71m@xmath8 , such as those produced by the current simulations . as such 
 , direct comparison between simulations and observations is not yet possible . 
 however , we do have another avenue currently available to us through the observation of polluted white dwarfs . 
 pollution of the white dwarf photosphere is thought to be produced by the accretion of solid material from a planetary system orbiting the progenitor star . 
 as the host star evolves and undergoes mass loss , the planetary system is disrupted , producing dynamically unstable orbits and resulting in the subsequent accretion of planetary material onto the white dwarf @xcite . 
 as a white dwarf atmosphere is composed of only h and/or he , any accreted material can be detected , provided it is observed before it disperses throughout the convective zone . 
 recent studies @xcite have detected evidence of the accretion of rocky planetesimals onto white dwarfs . 
 composed of mg , si , o and fe , the accreted material is similar to earth in bulk composition . @xcite observed mg / si values in the white dwarf nltt 43806 of 1.05 - 1.26 , consistent with accretion of earth - like material . 
 furthermore , @xcite observed pollution that may be consistent with the accretion of a refractory - rich body , such as those produced in the inner regions of hd17051 and hd19994 by the present simulations . 
 these observations appear to support the results of this study in that extrasolar terrestrial planets with mg - silicate compositions are likely to exist , with refractory - rich  earth - like "" bodies also possible ( although not confirmed ) . 
 polluted white dwarf surveys including carbon have not yet been completed , preventing us from comparing our c - rich simulated planets to direct observations . 
 several broad inferences about the nature of the simulated extrasolar terrestrial planetary interiors can be made on the basis of the current simulations by assuming crystal settling in a global magma ocean is driven by density ( i.e. most dense species sink to the core , least dense species float as a crust ) . 
 the interiors for the mg - depleted silicate planets are expected to contain an fe - ni - s core , overlain by a mantle of diopside ( camgsi@xmath2o@xmath14 ) and spinel ( mgal@xmath2o@xmath0 ) , with a crust of pyroxene and feldspar ( naalsi@xmath3o@xmath15 ) . 
 on the other hand , due to their relatively low carbon enrichment , the planets of 55cnc will have a fe - ni - s core with a spinel , diopside and olivine mantle and a pyroxene , feldspar and graphite crust . 
 given the low mass of all of the simulated planets ( m@xmath70.67m@xmath8 ) , unless a significant amount of radioactive material is accreted by the planet or tidal heating is significant , it will be difficult to produce substantial amounts of magmatic melt . 
 any melt that is produced is expected to be intermediate to felsic in composition due to the lower abundance of mg . 
 however , given the high content of refractory elements , production of significant amounts of melt within the mantle would be severely limited . 
 simulations of the interior processes of super earth planets have been completed ( e.g. @xcite ) assuming a planetary composition similar to that of earth . in light of the range of planetary compositions 
 now predicted to exist and the implications that the compositional variations may have on a planetary interior , such simulations should consider a more diverse range of compositions .      as all of the systems examined in this letter are capable of producing mg - silicate planets , albeit with non - earth - like compositions , systems orbiting host stars with a mg / si ratio less than 1 should still be included in terrestrial planet searches . 
 due to their predominantly silicate composition , terrestrial planets within these systems are not expected to be overly dark . 
 their albedo should be comparable to light c and s type asteroids ( albedo @xmath13 0.10 - 0.20 ) , depending on the distribution of carbon ( if any ) within the crust . 
 thus it is theoretically possible that planets such as those simulated here may be detected via reflected light . 
 recent observational studies have shown that a significant proportion of planetary host stars may have an mg / si ratio less than 1 . we have simulated terrestrial planet formation within three such systems and found that such systems produce a variety of planetary compositions , depending on the location of the planetary feeding zone within the disk . 
 mg - depleted silicate planets and c - enriched  earth - like "" planets were simulated within these systems , further supporting the idea that  earth - like  may not be the average composition of extrasolar terrestrial planets . 
 these results are in agreement with observations of polluted white dwarfs . 
 finally , further studies of planetary interiors need to be undertaken in order to fully understand the full implications of these varying compositions .

26,"this paper is motivated by the need for a robust implementation of solid sweeps in solid modeling kernels . 
 the solid sweep is of course , the envelope surface of a solid which is swept in space by a family of rotations and translations . 
 the uses of sweeps are many , e.g. , in the design of scrolls  @xcite , in cnc machining verification  @xcite , to detect collisions , and so on . 
 see appendix for an application of solid sweep in designing scrolls , where we describe a modeling attempt using an existing kernel and its limitations . 
 constant radius blends can be considered as the partial envelope of a sphere moving along a specified path . as with blends 
 , it is expected that a deeper mathematical understanding of solid sweep will lead to its rapid deployment and use . 
 a robust implementation of solid sweep poses the following requirements : ( i ) allow for input models specified in the industry - standard brep format , ( ii ) output the sweep envelope in the brep format , with effective evaluators , and finally , ( iii ) perform body - check , i.e. , a check on the orientability , non - self - intersection , detection of singularities and so on . 
 thus there are some `` local '' parts and some `` global '' parts to the problem . 
 it is generally recognized that the harder parts of the local theory is in the smooth case , i.e. , when faces meet each other smoothly . for in the non - smooth case , the added complexity in the local geometry of the sweep is exactly that of a curve moving in 3-space . 
 this is of course well understood , and offered by many kernels as a basic surface type . as far as we know , 
 the global situation in the non - smooth case , i.e. , the topological structure of edges and vertices ( i.e. , the 1-cage ) of the sweep has not been elucidated , but is also generally assumed to be simpler than the smooth case . 
 in fact , much of existing literature has focused on a smooth single - face solid , as the key problem  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the smooth multi - face solid . in section  [ simplesec ] , we start with the mathematical structure of the simple sweep ( i.e. , one without singularities and self - intersections ) . by the calculus of curves of contact 
 , we set up a correspondence between the faces , edges and vertices of the envelope with those of the swept solid . 
 this sets up the brep structure of the envelope . 
 next , we define the funnel as the parametrization space of a face of the envelope and construct a parametrization . 
 we further elucidate the structure of the bounding edges / vertices of a face and provide several examples of simple sweeps from a pilot implementation .    in section  [ simplesisec ] 
 , we examine the trim structures . 
 the funnel of section  [ simplesec ] will remain the ambient parametrization of the faces . 
 the correspondence will help us define the trim areas and trim curves which must be excised to form the correct envelope . 
 we then define the function @xmath1 and use it to define elementary and singular trim curves .    in section  [ decompsec ] 
 , we start with the decomposable sweep , i.e. , one which may be partitioned into a suitable small collection of simple sweeps . 
 the final envelope is obtained by stable ( transversal ) boolean operations on this collection . 
 we show that the trim curves so obtained are elementary . 
 we next define an invariant @xmath2 on the funnels , which is robustly and efficiently computable and we show that @xmath3 on ( all ) the funnels characterizes decomposability . 
 this is an important step in the robust implementation of sweeps .    in section  [ thetasec ] , we prove some of the properties of @xmath2 such as its invariance and show that it is the determinant of the transformation connecting two 2-frames on the envelope , and is thus an easily computable function on the surface . 
 we show that the @xmath4 curve on the funnel is also the singular locus for the envelope surface . via a geometric theorem 
 , we also show that the function @xmath2 matches the one by  @xcite for implicitly defined surfaces and using the so - called inverse trajectory .    in section  [ nondecompsec ] 
 , we define the singular trim curve , i.e. , where @xmath5 may hit zero . 
 we show that there is a correspondence between singular trim curves and the curves in the zero - locus of @xmath2 . 
 we also show that ( i ) singular trim curves make contact with the @xmath4 curves , and ( ii ) excision at the singular trim curves removes all singularities of the envelope except at these points of contact . furthermore , these points are easily and robustly computed . 
 in section  [ conclusionsec ] we summarize what has been achieved , viz . 
 , that the decomposability and the zero - locus of @xmath2 complement to give a complete understanding of all trim curves . 
 we also discuss some implementation issues and extensions . 
 * previous work *    we now review existing related work . 
 perhaps the most elaborate proposal for the sweep surface @xmath6 is the sweep envelope differential equations  @xcite approach , where the authors ( i ) assume that surface @xmath7 being swept is implicitly given by a function @xmath8 , and ( ii ) derive a differential equation whose solution is the envelope . for any point @xmath9 on the initial curve of contact , a runge - kutta marching 
 yields a trajectory @xmath10 such that ( i ) @xmath11 , and ( ii ) @xmath12 , the curve of contact at time @xmath13 . 
 these trajectories presumably serve as the iso - parametric lines @xmath14 . determining whether @xmath10 is in the trimming set @xmath15 
 is solved by using the inverse trajectory condition . 
 this is implemented by using the second derivative of the function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the inverse trajectory of point @xmath18 .    on the global front 
 , the building of the envelope @xmath6 is done by selecting a collection of points on the initial curve of contact , developing trajectories , testing for membership in @xmath15 and then using the points which pass to construct an approximation to the envelope . 
 the drawbacks are clear . typically , constructing an @xmath8 which defines @xmath7 is difficult . 
 furthermore , the choice of @xmath8 seems to determine many computational and parametric issues , which is undesirable . 
 the inverse - trajectory check remains poorly conditioned , especially when the second derivative of the function @xmath19 w.r.t . 
 @xmath13 is zero . 
 the structure of the envelope is unknown where this derivative is zero . 
 a global understanding of @xmath15 and the nature of the trim curves is missing .    in  @xcite , 
 while classifying points for sweeping solids , the authors give a membership test for a point in the object space to belong inside , outside or on the boundary of the swept volume by using inverse trajectory of that point . 
 a curve - solid intersection is required to be computed for each point membership query which is computationally expensive , especially when the intersection is non - transversal , as noted by the authors themselves . 
 such high degree of computational complexity is prohibitive for a practical implementation .    in 
 @xcite the authors work with 2d shapes and 2d motions and quantify singularities using inverse trajectories . 
 this work is based on the computational framework described in  @xcite and involves computing intersections between 2d curves and 2d shapes . 
 the authors remark that this work can be extended to the 3-dimensional case involving intersections between 3d curves and 3d solids . 
 this approach has the same drawback as  @xcite , namely a high computational cost .    in trimming self - intersections in swept volumes 
 @xcite , the authors detect self - intersections by computing approximate curves of contact at a few discrete time instances which are then checked for intersections . 
 approximations are introduced at multiple levels , hence an accurate solution can not be expected from this method . 
 in this section we formulate the boundary of the volume obtained by sweeping a solid @xmath20 along a given trajectory @xmath21 . 
 we will use the boundary representation , also known as brep , which is a popular standard for representing a compact and oriented solid @xmath20 by its boundary @xmath22 . 
 the boundary @xmath22 separates the interior of @xmath20 from the exterior of @xmath20 and is represented using a set of _ faces _ , _ edges _ and _ vertices_. see figure  [ conefig ] for the brep of a solid where different faces are colored differently . 
 faces meet in edges and edges meet in vertices . 
 the brep consists of two interconnected pieces of information , viz . , the geometric and the topological . 
 the geometric information consists of the parametric description of the faces and edges while the topological information consists of orientation of the geometric entities and adjacency relations between them .    in this paper 
 we consider solids whose boundary is formed by faces meeting smoothly . in the case when the faces do not meet smoothly , the added complexity in the local geometry of the sweep is exactly that of a curve moving in 3-space . 
 this is of course well understood , and offered by many kernels as a basic surface type . 
 the global geometry and topology for this case will be described in a later paper . 
 [ trajectorydef ] a * trajectory * in @xmath23 is specified by a map @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a closed interval of @xmath26 , @xmath27 . 
 the parameter @xmath13 represents time . 
 we assume that @xmath21 is of class @xmath28 for some @xmath29 , i.e. , partial derivatives of order up to @xmath30 exist and are continuous . 
 we make the following key assumption about @xmath31 . 
 [ genericassum ] the tuple @xmath31 is in a _ 
 general position_.    [ envldef ] the * action * of @xmath21 ( at time @xmath13 in @xmath25 ) on @xmath20 is given by @xmath32 . 
 the * swept volume * @xmath33 is the union @xmath34 and the * envelope * @xmath6 is defined as the boundary of the swept volume @xmath33 . 
 clearly , for each point @xmath35 of @xmath6 there must be an @xmath36 and a @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . 
 this sets up the following correspondence relation . 
 [ corrdef ] the * correspondence * @xmath39 is the set of tuples @xmath40 for @xmath41 , we set @xmath42 . 
 similarly , for @xmath43 , we define @xmath44 . 
 we will denote the interior of a set @xmath45 by @xmath46 . 
 it is clear that @xmath47 . 
 therefore , we have    [ intlem ] if @xmath48 , then for all @xmath37 , @xmath49 .        thus , the points in interior of @xmath20 do not contribute to @xmath6 at all and @xmath50 . 
 this sets up the brep structure for @xmath6 . in the sweep example shown in figure  [ conefig ] , the correspondence @xmath39 is illustrated via color coding , i.e. , for @xmath51 , the points @xmath35 and @xmath18 are shown in the same color . the general position assumption on @xmath31 
 can be formulated as the condition that the induced brep topology of @xmath6 remains invariant under a small perturbation of @xmath31 . 
 [ preimagelem ] assuming general position of @xmath31 , for any @xmath52 , there are at most three distinct tuples @xmath53 for @xmath54 which belong to @xmath55 . 
 _ for distinct tuples @xmath56 , it is clear that @xmath57 , for otherwise @xmath58 . therefore @xmath59 and @xmath60 intersect at point @xmath35 . by assumption  [ genericassum ] 
 this intersection is transversal . 
 further , by the same assumption , at most @xmath61 surfaces may intersect in a point . 
 @xmath62    [ trajxdef ] for a point @xmath36 , define the * trajectory of * @xmath63 as the map @xmath64 given by @xmath65 and the velocity @xmath66 as @xmath67 . 
 for a point @xmath68 , let @xmath69 be the unit outward normal to @xmath20 at @xmath18 . 
 define the function @xmath70 as @xmath71 thus , @xmath72 is the dot product of the velocity vector with the unit normal at the point @xmath73 . 
 proposition  [ glem ] gives a necessary condition for a point @xmath68 to contribute a point on @xmath6 at time @xmath13 , namely , @xmath74 , and is a rewording in our notation of the statement in  @xcite that _ the candidate set is the union of the ingress , the egress and the grazing set of points_.    [ glem ] for @xmath51 and @xmath75 $ ] , either ( i ) @xmath76 or ( ii ) @xmath77 and @xmath78 , or ( iii ) @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    for proof 
 , refer the appendix . 
 [ cocdef ] for a fixed time instant @xmath41 , the set @xmath81 is referred to as the * curve of contact * at @xmath82 and denoted by @xmath83 . 
 observe that @xmath84 . 
 the union of the curves of contact is referred to as the * contact set * and denoted by @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 .    in the sweep example in figure  [ dumbbellfig ] 
 , the curve of contact at @xmath87 is shown imprinted on the solid in red . 
 the curves of contact are referred to as the _ characteristic curves _ in  @xcite . 
 [ projdef ] define projections @xmath88 and @xmath89 as : @xmath90 . 
 [ simpledef ] a sweep @xmath91 is said to be * simple * if for all @xmath92 , @xmath93 . 
 note that , by proposition  [ glem ] , for any sweep , we have @xmath94 . in a simple sweep , we require that @xmath93 . 
 in other words , every point on the contact - set appears on the envelope , and thus , no _ trimming _ of the contact - set is needed in order to obtain the envelope . 
 [ simplelem ] for a simple sweep , for all @xmath52 , @xmath95 is a singleton set .    _ 
 _ we first show that for a simple sweep , for @xmath96 , @xmath97 . 
 suppose that @xmath98 . clearly , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . hence @xmath101 . since @xmath102 and @xmath103 intersect transversally , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . 
 it follows by lemma  [ intlem ] that @xmath106 and @xmath107 which contradicts the fact that @xmath91 is simple . 
 now suppose that there are @xmath108 tuples @xmath109 for @xmath110 . since @xmath22 is free from self - intersections it follows that @xmath57 and @xmath111 which is a contradiction to the fact that @xmath91 is simple . 
 @xmath62      now we describe parametrizations of the various entities of the induced brep structure of @xmath6 . here 
 we restrict to the case of the simple sweep . 
 the more general case is derived from this . 
 let @xmath112 be a face of @xmath113 . 
 in general , @xmath112 gives rise to multiple faces of @xmath6 . 
 below we describe a natural parametrization of these faces using the parametrization of the surface underlying the face @xmath112 . 
 [ parsurfdef ] a * smooth / regular parametric surface * in @xmath23 is a smooth map @xmath114 such that at all @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 are linearly independent . here 
 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are called the parameters of the surface . 
 let @xmath120 be the surface underlying the face @xmath112 of @xmath22 . 
 [ fdef ] define the function @xmath121 as @xmath122 . 
 the domain of function @xmath8 will be referred to as the parameter space . 
 note that @xmath8 is easily and robustly computed . 
 [ lfrdef ] for an interval @xmath75 $ ] , we define the following subsets of the parameter space @xmath123    the set @xmath124 will be referred to as the * funnel*.        by assumption  [ genericassum ] about the general position of @xmath31 it follows that for all @xmath125 , the gradient 
 @xmath126^t \neq \bar{0}$ ] . as a consequence , 
 @xmath124 is a smooth , orientable surface in the parameter space . 
 [ pcocdef ] the set @xmath127 will be referred to as the * p - curve of contact * at @xmath82 and denoted by @xmath128 . 
 we now define the sweep map from the parameter space to the object space . 
 [ sigmadef ] the * sweep map * is defined as follows . 
 @xmath129    note that , @xmath130 is a smooth map , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . here and later , by a slight abuse of notation , @xmath6 , @xmath85 and @xmath133 denote the appropriate parts of complete @xmath6 , @xmath85 and @xmath133 respectively resulting from the face @xmath134 whose underlying surface is @xmath7 . 
 the surface patches @xmath135 and @xmath136 will be referred to as the left and right end - caps respectively . 
 the funnel , the contact - set , @xmath128 and @xmath83 are shown schematically in figure  [ funnelfig ] . 
 the condition @xmath137 can also be looked upon as the rank deficiency condition  @xcite of the jacobian @xmath138 of the sweep map @xmath130 . to make this precise , 
 let @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . 
 note that if @xmath143 then @xmath144 is the velocity , also denoted by @xmath145 . 
 observe that regularity of @xmath7 ensures that @xmath138 has rank at least 2 . 
 further , it is easy to show that @xmath146 is a non - zero scalar multiple of the determinant of @xmath138 . 
 therefore , the condition @xmath147 is precisely the rank deficiency condition of @xmath138 .    for a simple sweep , by proposition  [ glem ] , definition  [ simpledef ] and definition  [ lfrdef ] it follows that @xmath148 . 
 the surface patches @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be obtained from @xmath22 using proposition  [ glem ] and definition  [ lfrdef ] . 
 the _ trim curve _ in parameter space for @xmath135 is given by @xmath149 and that for @xmath136 is given by @xmath150 . 
 we now come to the parametrization of @xmath151 . 
 the non - singularity of @xmath8 makes @xmath124 an effective parametrization space for @xmath151 . since time 
 @xmath13 is a central parameter of the sweep problem and is important in numerous applications , it is useful to have @xmath13 as one of the parameters of @xmath151 . for most non - trivial sweeps there is no closed form solution for the parametrization of the envelope and we address this problem using the procedural paradigm which is now standard in many kernels and is described in the appendix . in this approach , a set of evaluators are constructed for the curve / surface via numerical procedures which converge to the solution up to the required tolerance . 
 this has the advantage of being computationally efficient as well as accurate . 
 clearly , the bounding edges of the multiple faces resulting from the face @xmath112 of @xmath22 , are generated by the bounding edges of @xmath112 .      . 
 ]    we now briefly describe the computation of edges of @xmath6 . 
 if @xmath22 is composed of faces meeting smoothly , an edge @xmath152 of @xmath22 will , in general , give rise to a set of edges in @xmath6 . 
 we define the restriction of @xmath39 to the edge @xmath152 as follows .    for an edge @xmath153 , 
 define @xmath154 . 
 let @xmath152 be the intersection of faces @xmath155 and @xmath156 in @xmath22 and let @xmath157 denote the parameter of @xmath152 . since @xmath155 and @xmath156 meet smoothly at @xmath152 , at every point @xmath158 of @xmath152 there is a well - defined normal . 
 hence we may define the following function on the parameter space @xmath159 . 
 [ fedef ] define the function @xmath160 as @xmath161 . 
 note that the function @xmath162 is the restriction of the function @xmath8 defined in definition  [ fdef ] to the parameter space curve @xmath163 corresponding to the edge @xmath152 
 so that @xmath164 where @xmath7 is the surface underlying face @xmath155 . the following lemma gives a necessary condition for a point @xmath158 to be on @xmath6 at time @xmath13 . 
 [ felem ] for @xmath165 and @xmath75 $ ] , either ( i ) @xmath77 and @xmath166 , or ( ii ) @xmath79 and @xmath167 , or ( iii ) @xmath168 . 
 _ this follows from prop . 
 [ glem ] and definition  [ fedef ] . 
 @xmath62 figure  [ wireframefig ] shows the edges of the envelope for the sweep example shown in figure  [ conefig ] . 
 the correspondence for one of the edges of the envelope is also marked . 
 let @xmath169 denote the funnel corresponding to the contact set generated by face @xmath155 . 
 the edge in parameter space which bounds @xmath169 is given by @xmath170 which we will denote by @xmath171 . 
 note that @xmath171 is smooth if @xmath172 at all points in @xmath171 . 
 a vertex @xmath173 on @xmath113 will , in general , give rise to a set of vertices on @xmath6 . 
 we further restrict the correspondence @xmath39 to @xmath173 as @xmath174 . as @xmath22 is smooth , there is a well - defined normal at @xmath173 . 
 hence we may define the function @xmath175 as @xmath176 . 
 if @xmath173 is on the boundary of a face @xmath155 , @xmath173 will have a set of coordinates in the parameter space of the surface @xmath7 
 underlying the face @xmath155 , say @xmath177 , so that @xmath178 . 
 it is easy to see that if @xmath179 and @xmath75 $ ] then either ( i ) @xmath77 and @xmath180 , or ( ii ) @xmath79 and @xmath181 , or ( iii ) @xmath182 . 
 three examples of simple sweeps are shown in figures  [ dumbbellfig ] , [ ellipbottlefig ] and [ spheresfig ] which were generated using a pilot implementation of our algorithm in acis 3d modeler @xcite . 
 a curve of contact at initial time is shown imprinted on the solid in figure  [ dumbbellfig ] .    -axis and undergoing rotation about @xmath35-axis . ] 
 unlike in a simple sweep , all points of @xmath85 may not belong to the envelope . 
 we now define the subset of @xmath85 which needs to be excised in order to obtain @xmath6 . 
 [ trimsetdef ] the * trim set * is defined as @xmath183    [ trimsetlem ] the set @xmath184 is open in @xmath85 . 
 _ consider a point @xmath185 . 
 then @xmath186 for some @xmath41 . 
 hence , there exists an open ball of non - zero radius @xmath187 centered at @xmath188 , denote it by @xmath189 , which is itself contained in @xmath190 
 . let @xmath191 . then 
 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 is open in @xmath184 . 
 hence @xmath15 is open in @xmath85 . 
 @xmath62    in general , the trim set will span several parts of @xmath85 corresponding to different faces of @xmath22 . 
 for the ease of notation and presentation , in the rest of this paper , we will analyse the corresponding trim structures on the _ funnel _ of a fixed face @xmath112 of @xmath22 . 
 thanks to the natural parametrizations ( cf . 
 subsection  [ paramsec ] ) , the migration of these trim structures across different funnels is an easy implementation detail . in view of this , we carry forward the notation developed in subsection  [ keynotation ] through the rest of this paper . 
 [ trimsetdef ] the pre - image of @xmath184 on the funnel under the map @xmath130 will be referred to as the * p - trim set * , denoted by @xmath194 , i.e. , @xmath195 . 
 an immediate corollary of lemma  [ trimsetlem ] is : @xmath194 is open in @xmath124 . 
 one can also define similar parametric trim areas on the left and right caps ( cf . 
 @xmath196 and @xmath197 from definition  [ lfrdef ] ) and their counterparts in the object space . 
 however , for want of space , we assume here that these trim structures are empty . 
 our analysis can be extended to also cover the non - empty case . 
 [ trimcurvedef ] the boundary of @xmath198 will be referred to as the * trim curves * and denoted by @xmath199 . here 
 @xmath198 denotes the closure of @xmath184 in @xmath85 . 
 similarly , the boundary of the closure @xmath200 of @xmath194 in @xmath124 will be referred to as the * p - trim curves * and denoted by @xmath201 . 
 note that @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 . 
 therefore the problem of excising the trim set is reduced to the problem of computing the trim curves . 
 further , this computation is eventually reduced to _ guided _ parametric surface - surface intersections via the parametrization of @xmath151 described in subsection  [ paramsec ] . 
 for each point @xmath205 there is a finite set of points @xmath206 such that @xmath207 for all @xmath208 ( cf . 
 lemma  [ preimagelem ] ) . figure  [ ptrimcurveafig ] schematically illustrates p - trim curves on @xmath124 . for every point @xmath209 in the red portion of @xmath201 
 , there is a point @xmath210 in the green portion of @xmath201 such that @xmath211 . 
 we extend the correspondence of definition  [ corrdef ] to @xmath212 as below . abusing notation , 
 henceforth , @xmath39 will denote this correspondence . 
 let @xmath213 . 
 as expected , we define @xmath88 and @xmath214 as : @xmath90 . 
 further , as before , @xmath42 , @xmath215 . 
 a crucial observation is that , unlike the earlier correspondence , _ @xmath216_.    [ ldef ] for @xmath217 , let @xmath218 . 
 let @xmath219 . 
 define the function @xmath220 as follows . 
 @xmath221 further , we define @xmath222 .    for @xmath125 
 , @xmath223 is the set of all time instances @xmath224 ( except @xmath13 ) such that some point of @xmath225 coincides with @xmath226 . 
 further , the function @xmath1 gives the ` smallest ' time @xmath227 such that some point of @xmath228 coincides with @xmath226 . 
 [ trimclem ] let @xmath229 . 
 then @xmath230 iff @xmath231 contains an interval , and @xmath232 iff @xmath231 is a discrete set of cardinality either two or three .    _ proof . 
 _ suppose first that @xmath233 . 
 let @xmath234 . then @xmath185 and @xmath186 for some @xmath41 
 let @xmath189 be an open ball of radius @xmath235 centered at @xmath188 contained in @xmath190 . 
 assume without loss of generality that @xmath236 and @xmath237 . 
 by continuity of the trajectory @xmath21 it follows that given @xmath238 there exists @xmath239 such that @xmath240 . 
 hence , @xmath241 for all @xmath242 $ ] . in other words , @xmath243 \in l(p_0)$ ] . 
 conversely , suppose that @xmath231 contains an interval @xmath244 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath245 for all @xmath246 $ ] . by assumption  [ genericassum ] about the general position of @xmath31 it follows that @xmath241 for some @xmath246 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath185 and @xmath233 . 
 we have shown that for @xmath229 , @xmath233 iff @xmath231 contains an interval . 
 hence , @xmath231 is discrete iff @xmath232 .    as @xmath247 , by lemma  [ preimagelem ] 
 , it follows that at all but finitely many points @xmath248 , @xmath223 is of cardinality @xmath108 and at remaining points it is of cardinality @xmath61 . 
 @xmath62    we classify trim curves as follows .    [ trimcclassifydef ] a curve @xmath249 of @xmath201 is said to be * elementary * if there exists @xmath250 such that for all @xmath251 , @xmath252 . 
 it is said to be * singular * if @xmath253 . 
 figures  [ ptrimcurveafig](a ) and  [ ptrimcurveafig](b ) schematically illustrate elementary and singular p - trim curves on @xmath124 respectively . 
 further observe that , @xmath254 in case ( a ) and 0 in case ( b ) .    before proceeding further 
 , we introduce the following notation : for @xmath255 , @xmath256 . 
 [ transinterlem ] all but finitely many points of elementary trim curves lie on the transversal intersections of two surface patches @xmath257 and the remaining points lie on the transversal intersection of three surface patches @xmath257 where , for @xmath258 , @xmath259 are subintervals . 
 _ suppose that all curves of @xmath201 are elementary , i.e. , @xmath260 such that for all @xmath248 , @xmath261 . 
 by lemma  [ trimclem ] , all but finitely many points @xmath205 have two points @xmath262 and @xmath263 in @xmath201 such that @xmath264 . 
 let @xmath265)$ ] and @xmath266)$ ] 
 . then @xmath267 . from section  [ geomthetasec ] 
 we know that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are tangential to @xmath268 and @xmath269 respectively at @xmath35 . 
 by assumption  [ genericassum ] about general position of @xmath31 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 intersect transversally at @xmath35 . 
 hence , @xmath268 and @xmath270 intersect transversally at @xmath35 .    at most finitely 
 many points @xmath205 have three points @xmath271 and @xmath272 in @xmath201 such that @xmath207 . by an argument similar to above 
 , it can be shown that @xmath35 lies on the transversal intersection of three surface patches @xmath273 for @xmath274 corresponding to appropriate subintervals @xmath259 . 
 @xmath62    figure  [ toolfig ] shows an example in which a capsule is swept along a helical path while rotating about @xmath35-axis . 
 the trim curves are elementary .

 we now consider sweeps , which though not simple , can be divided into simple sweeps by partitioning the sweep interval so that the trim curves can be obtained by transversal intersections of the contact sets of the resulting simple sweeps . given an interval @xmath25 , we call a partition @xmath276 of @xmath25 into consecutive intervals @xmath277 to be of width @xmath278 if @xmath279 . 
 [ decompdef ] we say that the sweep @xmath280 is * decomposable * if there exists @xmath250 such that for all partitions @xmath276 of @xmath25 of width @xmath278 , each sweep @xmath281 is simple for @xmath282 . 
 a sweep which is not decomposable is called * non - decomposable*.    figure  [ decompnondecompfig ] schematically illustrates the difference between decomposable and non - decomposable sweeps . 
 the example shown in figure  [ toolfig ] is of a decomposable sweep in which partitioning the sweep interval @xmath25 into 2 equal halves will result in 2 simple sweeps . 
 [ decomplem ] the sweep @xmath91 is decomposable iff @xmath254 . 
 further , if @xmath254 then all the p - trim curves are elementary . 
 _ suppose first that @xmath254 . 
 let @xmath276 be a partition of @xmath25 of width @xmath283 . 
 we show that @xmath284 is simple for @xmath285 . 
 let @xmath286 and @xmath287 be the envelope and the contact set for @xmath284 respectively . by proposition  [ glem ] , ( modulo end - caps ) , 
 it needs to be shown that @xmath289 . 
 suppose not . 
 let @xmath290 such that @xmath291 for some @xmath292 . 
 then , @xmath293 , i.e. , @xmath294 for some @xmath295 . 
 let @xmath296 for @xmath297 . 
 it follows that @xmath298 , leading to a contradiction . 
 hence , @xmath91 is decomposable . 
 suppose now that @xmath91 is decomposable with width - parameter @xmath278 ( cf . definition  [ decompdef ] ) . 
 consider a point @xmath299 and let @xmath300 . 
 let @xmath301 $ ] and @xmath302 $ ] . 
 further , let @xmath286 and @xmath287 be the envelope and contact - set for the sweeps @xmath284 respectively . 
 observe that @xmath303 for @xmath304 . 
 let @xmath305 . 
 as @xmath91 is decomposable with width - parameter @xmath278 , both @xmath306 and @xmath307 are simple , and hence , @xmath289 for @xmath304 . 
 therefore , @xmath188 belongs to @xmath308 and @xmath309 . by lemma 
 [ simplelem ] , @xmath310 and @xmath311 are both singleton sets . 
 further , @xmath312 for @xmath313 . 
 hence , @xmath314 . 
 since for all @xmath125 , @xmath252 , we conclude that @xmath315 . 
 suppose that @xmath254 . 
 since @xmath316 for all @xmath248 if follows that all the p - trim curves are elementary . 
 @xmath62    the above proposition provides a _ natural _ 
 test for decomposability . 
 further , coupled with lemma  [ transinterlem ] , for a decomposable sweep , the problem of excising the trim set can be reduced to transversal intersections . 
 however , note that , the very definition of @xmath283 is _ post - facto _ as it relies on the trim structures . besides , it is the infimum value of the not necessarily continuous function @xmath1 and is difficult to compute . 
 thus , the above test of decomposability is not effective . 
 one of the key contributions of this paper is a novel geometric ` invariant ' function on the funnel which is computed in closed form and serves the following objectives . 
 1 .   quick / efficient and simple detection of decomposability of sweeps , which occur most often in practice . 
 2 .   generation of trim curves for non - decomposable sweeps . 
 3 .   quantification and detection of singularities on the envelope .    for a point @xmath317 , 
 let @xmath318 . 
 recall from subsection  [ paramsec ] that , @xmath319 $ ] is of rank 2 . as @xmath320 , @xmath321 
 are linearly dependent . 
 recall that @xmath322 is the velocity of the point @xmath120 at time @xmath13 ( cf . 
 subsection  [ paramsec ] ) . 
 as @xmath7 is regular , the set @xmath323 forms a basis for the tangent space to @xmath102 . 
 therefore , we must have @xmath324 where @xmath325 and @xmath326 are well - defined ( unique ) on the funnel and are themselves continuous functions on the funnel .    [ thetadef ] the function @xmath327 is defined as follows . 
 @xmath328 where @xmath329 and @xmath330 denote partial derivatives of the function @xmath8 w.r.t . @xmath331 and @xmath13 respectively at @xmath9 , and @xmath325 and @xmath326 are as defined before . 
 note that , unlike @xmath1 , @xmath0 is easily and robustly computable continuous function on the funnel . 
 now we are ready to state one of the main theorems of this paper . 
 [ thetadecomplem ] if for all @xmath125 , @xmath332 , then the sweep is decomposable . 
 further , if there exists @xmath125 such that @xmath333 , then the sweep is non - decomposable .    the proof is given in section  [ proofsec ] which highlights many other surprisingly strong properties of the function @xmath0 .    the function @xmath0 partitions the funnel @xmath124 into three sets , viz . 
 ( i ) @xmath334 , ( ii ) @xmath335 and ( iii ) @xmath336 . 
 further , we define @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 . 
 figure  [ lsiregionfig ] schematically illustrates the sets @xmath340 and @xmath341 on the funnel and sets @xmath342 and @xmath343 . 
 and @xmath85 corresponds to @xmath344 and @xmath345 respectively . 
 a curve of contact is shown in red . ] 
 note that , for @xmath91 in general position , either @xmath344 is a non - empty open set or @xmath346 . 
 whence , the above theorem provides an efficient ` open ' test for decomposability , namely , a sweep @xmath91 is decomposable iff the open set @xmath344 is empty . 
 most kernels will have an effective procedure for such a test provided @xmath0 is effectively computable . 
 in this section we prove some key properties of @xmath0 , namely , its invariance under the re - parametrization of the surface being swept and its relation with the notion of inverse trajectory used in earlier works . 
 finally , we use these properties along with proposition  [ decomplem ] , to prove theorem  [ thetadecomplem ] . 
 we show that the function @xmath0 is invariant of the parametrization of @xmath22 and hence , intrinsic to the sweep . 
 [ thetainvarthm ] if @xmath347 is a re - parametrization of the surface @xmath7 so that @xmath348 , and @xmath349 , then @xmath350 .    _ 
 _ suppose as before that the boundary @xmath22 is specified by the parametrized surface @xmath7 . 
 let @xmath351 be a re - parametrization map of @xmath7 and @xmath352 . since @xmath353 is a diffeomorphism 
 , @xmath354 is an isomorphism at every point in the entire domain of @xmath353 . 
 let @xmath355 . 
 for convenience of expression , we extend @xmath353 to define it on the parameter space of the sweep map @xmath130 so that @xmath356 . 
 hence the re - parametrized sweep map ( for @xmath347 ) is simply @xmath357 . recall that @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the unit outward normal to @xmath102 at the point @xmath360 . 
 it is easy to check that @xmath359 can also be expressed as @xmath361 , where @xmath362 is the intrinsic gauss map , @xmath363 being the unit sphere and @xmath364 stands for the usual composition of functions . 
 thus , @xmath365    similarly , computing with the re - parametrization @xmath347 , and using the fact that @xmath366 , we have @xmath367 . differentiating w.r.t . @xmath368 and 
 @xmath13 we get @xmath369 where @xmath354 is the jacobian of the map @xmath353 . 
 observe that , from eq . 
 [ thetaeq ] , for @xmath370 and @xmath371 , @xmath372 where @xmath373 spans the null - space of @xmath374 for @xmath375 . 
 in order to compute @xmath376 for the re - parametrized sweep we see that @xmath377 and @xmath378 . now using @xmath369 
 , we get that @xmath379 this proves the theorem . 
 @xmath62    an important corollary of the above theorem is that the function @xmath0 on the funnel is a pull - back of an intrinsic function , say @xmath380 , on the abstract smooth manifold @xmath381 . 
 more precisely , for @xmath217 with @xmath382 , define @xmath383 . 
 then @xmath380 remains invariant under a re - parametrization . 
 observe that , unlike @xmath384 , in general , @xmath85 is not a smooth manifold .      for a smooth point @xmath385 of @xmath45 , 
 let @xmath386 denote the tangent space to @xmath45 at @xmath385 . 
 we show that the function @xmath0 arises out of the relation between two 2-frames on @xmath387 . 
 let @xmath388 be such that @xmath226 is a smooth point of @xmath85 . 
 we first compute a natural 2-frame @xmath389 in @xmath390 . 
 note that , @xmath391 being the zero level - set of the function @xmath8 , @xmath392 . 
 we set @xmath393 and note that @xmath394 . 
 it is easy to see that @xmath395 is tangent to the p - curve - of - contact @xmath396 . 
 let @xmath397 . here 
 @xmath398 is the cross - product in @xmath23 . clearly , the set @xmath399 forms a basis of @xmath390 if @xmath400 . since @xmath401 , if @xmath402 then @xmath403 and @xmath404 serves as a basis for @xmath390 . 
 figure  [ funnelfig ] illustrates the basis @xmath405 schematically . 
 the set @xmath406 and can be expressed in terms of @xmath407 as follows @xmath408 note that , @xmath409 clearly , if @xmath400 then @xmath410 is a positive scalar multiple of @xmath411 . again , 
 if @xmath402 , expressing @xmath412 in terms of @xmath407 we see that @xmath413 . 
 the above relation between @xmath407 and @xmath414 shows that if @xmath415 , then for @xmath296 , @xmath416 and @xmath417 are identitical ( as subspaces of @xmath418 ) , i.e. , @xmath102 makes tangential contact with @xmath85 at @xmath35 . 
 we give a sweep example which will demonstrate the non - singularity of the function @xmath0 . 
 we show that on the set @xmath341 , @xmath419 . consider a sphere parametrized as @xmath420 , @xmath421 , u \in [ -\pi , \pi]$ ] swept along a curvilinear trajectory given by @xmath422 , @xmath423 , @xmath424 $ ] . 
 the unit outward normal at @xmath120 at time @xmath13 is given by @xmath425 and velocity is given by @xmath426 . 
 the envelope function is @xmath427 . 
 the funnel @xmath124 is given by ( i ) @xmath428 , @xmath421 $ ] and ( ii ) @xmath429 , @xmath421 $ ] . 
 hence , @xmath118 and @xmath119 can serve as local parameters of @xmath124 . in component ( ii ) of the funnel , we see that @xmath3 , hence we will only consider component ( i ) . on @xmath124 , @xmath430 where 
 @xmath431 and @xmath432 , whence , @xmath433 . 
 the set @xmath341 is given by @xmath434 , @xmath428 . 
 on @xmath341 , @xmath435 and @xmath436 . 
 an important consequence of non - singularity of @xmath0 is that its zero set , i.e. , @xmath341 can be computed robustly and easily . 
 now we characterize the cusp - singular points of @xmath85 . 
 geometrically , these are precisely the points where @xmath85 intersects itself non - transversally . 
 note that , the transversal singularities of @xmath85 are addressed through decomposability . 
 we consider the following restriction of @xmath130 to the funnel : @xmath437 . 
 note that @xmath438 . 
 [ singdef ] the set @xmath85 is said to have a * cusp - singularity * at a point @xmath439 if @xmath440 fails to be an immersion at @xmath9 . 
 a basic result about immersion ( see @xcite ) implies that if @xmath441 is an immersion at a point @xmath9 , then there is a neighborhood @xmath442 of @xmath9 such that @xmath441 is a local diffeomorphism from @xmath442 onto its image . 
 [ singlem ] let @xmath443 and @xmath444 . 
 the point @xmath445 is a cusp - singularity iff @xmath446 . 
 _ from subsection  [ geomthetasec ] , @xmath447 is a positive multiple of the determinant relating frames @xmath407 and @xmath448 at @xmath445 . 
 since the set @xmath407 is always linearly independent , it follows that @xmath448 is linearly dependent iff @xmath440 fails to be an immersion at @xmath449 iff @xmath446 . 
 @xmath62    in other words , the set @xmath343 is the set of cusp - singular points in @xmath85 . 
 we now show the relation of the function @xmath0 with inverse trajectory  @xcite used in earlier works . given a trajectory @xmath21 and a fixed point @xmath18 in object - space , the inverse trajectory of @xmath18 is the set of points in the object - space which get mapped to @xmath18 at some time instant by @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath450 , a(t ) \cdot z + b(t ) = x\}$ ] .    [ invtrajdef ] given a trajectory @xmath21 , the * inverse trajectory * @xmath451 is defined as the map @xmath452 given by @xmath453 . 
 thus , for a fixed point @xmath454 , the inverse trajectory of @xmath18 is the map @xmath455 given by @xmath456 . 
 the range of @xmath457 is @xmath458 . 
 we list some of the facts about @xmath457 in the appendix which will be used in proving theorem  [ lambdalem ] .    for the inverse trajectory @xmath457 of a point @xmath459 , let @xmath460 be the projection of @xmath457 on @xmath461 . 
 let @xmath462 be the signed distance of @xmath463 from @xmath461 . 
 if the point @xmath463 is in @xmath190 , @xmath464 ( the exterior of @xmath20 ) or on the surface @xmath461 , then @xmath462 is negative , positive or zero respectively . 
 then we have @xmath465 , where @xmath466 is the projection of @xmath463 on @xmath461 along the unit outward pointing normal @xmath467 to @xmath461 at @xmath466 . 
 this is illustrated in figure  [ type2lsifig ] . 
 thus the following relation holds for @xmath468 . 
 @xmath469     intersects @xmath190 . ] 
 [ lambdalem ] for @xmath470 , @xmath471 where @xmath472 is the normal curvature of @xmath7 at @xmath473 along velocity @xmath474 , @xmath475 is the unit outward normal to @xmath7 at @xmath473 and @xmath476 . 
 see appendix for the proof .    from theorem  [ lambdalem ] 
 it is clear that the function @xmath0 is intimately connected with the curvature of the solid and that of the trajectory . 
 it is easy to see that the function @xmath468 is identical to the function @xmath477 defined in  @xcite for implicitly defined solids , albeit , is invariant of the function defining the solid as well as the parametrization of the same . 
 _ suppose that for all @xmath125 , @xmath332 . 
 for @xmath125 , let @xmath478 denote the @xmath13-coordinate of @xmath9 . 
 consider the set of points @xmath479 and @xmath480 . 
 by the general position assumption , @xmath481 is a collection of smooth curves in @xmath124 . for @xmath482 , let @xmath483 denote the unique point in @xmath481 such that @xmath484 and @xmath485 . 
 further , we define @xmath486 . let @xmath487 . 
 consider two cases as follows :    * case ( i ) * : @xmath488 , i.e. , there exists a sequence @xmath489 in a curve @xmath249 of @xmath481 such that @xmath490 . 
 hence there exists @xmath491 ( closure of @xmath249 ) which is a limit point of @xmath489 . 
 since @xmath492 and @xmath22 is free from self - intersections , we have that @xmath493 . 
 hence , for a small neighborhood @xmath442 of @xmath449 in @xmath124 , we may parametrize the smooth curve @xmath494 by a map @xmath495 so that @xmath496 and , for @xmath497 , @xmath498 and @xmath499 . 
 let @xmath500 . 
 note that @xmath501 . 
 now , @xmath502    hence , @xmath503 since @xmath504 , the map @xmath505 fails to be an immersion at @xmath449 and by lemma  [ singlem ] we get that @xmath446 , which is a contradiction to the hypothesis . 
 * case ( ii ) * : @xmath250 . 
 let @xmath506 be a partition of @xmath25 of width @xmath507 . 
 let @xmath274 and @xmath508 denote the funnel and the contact set corresponding to subinterval @xmath509 . 
 then it is clear that for each @xmath208 , @xmath510 is a diffeomorphism , i.e. , for each @xmath208 , @xmath511 for all @xmath512 , @xmath96 . 
 we show that the subproblems @xmath284 are simple for all @xmath208 . 
 suppose not , i.e. , for some @xmath208 , there exists @xmath292 such that @xmath513 for some @xmath295 . 
 hence the trim set @xmath514 is not empty . by lemma  [ transinterlem ] , 
 for all but finitely many points in @xmath515 there are two points @xmath516 such that @xmath517 . 
 if @xmath518 and @xmath519 then it follows that @xmath520 leading to contradiction . 
 hence , the subproblems @xmath284 are simple for all @xmath208 . 
 it follows that @xmath91 is decomposable with width - parameter @xmath507 . 
 hence we have proved that if for all @xmath125 , @xmath332 then the sweep is decomposable . 
 suppose now that there exists @xmath217 such that @xmath333 . 
 let @xmath296 . 
 recall the definition of the function @xmath468 from equation  [ lambdaeq ] and relation @xmath521 from theorem  [ lambdalem ] . 
 clearly , if @xmath522 , then @xmath13 is a local maxima of the function @xmath468 and the inverse trajectory of @xmath35 intersects @xmath523 . 
 so , there exists @xmath524 such that for all @xmath525 , there exists @xmath526 such that @xmath527 . 
 hence , the interval @xmath528 \subset l(p)$ ] . 
 thus @xmath529 and hence @xmath530 . 
 by proposition  [ decomplem ] , the sweep is non - decomposable . @xmath62

 the point @xmath449 is a singular trim point . ] 
 we recall from section  [ simplesisec ] , the classification of the curves of @xmath201 as being elementary or singular . in this section 
 we look at singular p - trim curves , i.e. , a curve @xmath249 of @xmath201 where @xmath531 . 
 figure  [ ptrimcurvefig](b ) schematically illustrates singular p - trim curves . 
 figures  [ nondecompspherefig ] and  [ nondecompellipsefig ] show two examples of non - decomposable sweeps and the associated singular trim curves . in figure  [ nondecompspherefig ] 
 a sphere undergoes curvilinear motion along a parabola and in figure  [ nondecompellipsefig ] an ellipsoid undergoes curvilinear motion along a circular arc . in figures  [ nondecompspherefig](a ) and 
 [ nondecompellipsefig](a ) , curves of contact at a few time instances are shown . 
 the portions of @xmath133 where @xmath3 and @xmath532 on @xmath533 are shown in black and pink respectively . by proposition  [ thetaneglem ] 
 , the points where @xmath0 is negative do not lie on @xmath6 . in figures  [ nondecompspherefig](b ) and  [ nondecompellipsefig](b ) such points are excised , the curve @xmath534 is shown in red and the trim curve @xmath199 is shown in blue . note that @xmath534 and @xmath199 make contact , which they must , as we explain in this section . 
 figure  [ cocfig ] schematically illustrates the interaction between curves of contact in non - decomposable sweeps . 
 [ singtrimclem ] if @xmath249 is a singular p - trim curve and @xmath535 is a limit - point of @xmath536 such that @xmath537 , then @xmath538 . 
 _ the proof is similar to case ( i ) of proof for theorem  [ thetadecomplem ] . 
 [ singtrimptdef ] a limit point @xmath9 of a singular p - trim curve @xmath249 such that @xmath539 will be called a * singular trim point*.    in figure  [ ptrimcurvefig](b ) a singular trim point @xmath449 is shown on @xmath201 . 
 [ thetaneglem ] if @xmath443 such that @xmath540 then @xmath233 . 
 _ let @xmath541 . 
 recall the definition of the function @xmath468 from equation  [ lambdaeq ] and relation @xmath542 from theorem  [ lambdalem ] . 
 clearly , if @xmath543 , then @xmath82 is a local maxima of the function @xmath468 and the inverse trajectory of @xmath544 intersects @xmath190 and @xmath545 . 
 hence , if @xmath540 then @xmath233 . 
 @xmath62    the above two propositions link the curves of @xmath341 to the curves of @xmath201 . 
 we see that every curve of @xmath341 lies inside a curve of @xmath201 and every curve @xmath249 of @xmath201 has a curve @xmath546 of @xmath341 which makes contact with it . 
 we have already seen that @xmath341 is a collection of curves on which @xmath547 is non - zero . 
 thus , the computation of @xmath341 in modern kernels is straightforward . 
 the task before us is now to locate the points of @xmath548 . 
 this is enabled by the following function . 
 [ omegadef ] let @xmath549 be a parametrization of a curve @xmath550 of @xmath341 . 
 let @xmath551 and @xmath552 at @xmath449 , i.e. , @xmath553 . 
 define the function @xmath554 as follows . 
 @xmath555 where @xmath398 is the cross - product in @xmath23 .    here , @xmath477 is a measure of the oriented angle between the tangent at @xmath449 to @xmath550 and the kernel ( line ) of the jacobian @xmath138 restricted to the tangent space @xmath556 . 
 [ omegaprop ] every singular p - trim curve @xmath249 makes contact with a curve @xmath550 of @xmath341 so that if @xmath449 is a singular trim point of @xmath249 then @xmath557 . furthermore , at such points , @xmath558 where @xmath559 refers to the derivative of @xmath477 along the curve @xmath550 . 
 _ we know from proposition  [ thetaneglem ] that @xmath560 . 
 since @xmath341 and @xmath201 form the boundaries of @xmath344 and @xmath194 respectively , @xmath341 and a singular p - trim curve @xmath249 of @xmath201 meet tangentially at the singular trim point . 
 further , by an argument similar to the case ( i ) of theorem  [ thetadecomplem ] , it can be seen that at a singular trim point @xmath449 , @xmath561 is the null - space of the jacobian @xmath562 . since @xmath563 , @xmath564 . since the function 
 @xmath477 measures the oriented angle between @xmath565 and @xmath566 , it follows that @xmath557 . 
 the derivative @xmath567 at singular trim points for non - decomposable sweeps shown in figure  [ nondecompspherefig ] and figure  [ nondecompellipsefig ] . 
 @xmath62    proposition  [ omegaprop ] confirms that for every singular p - trim curve , we may use the function @xmath477 to locate a singular trim point @xmath449 in a computationally robust manner . 
 thus , via @xmath0 and @xmath477 we may access every component of @xmath201 .    in the generic situation , 
 ( i ) the singular p - trim curve @xmath249 has a finite set of singular trim points . 
 each of these points lie on a curve of @xmath341 . 
 ( ii ) for all but finitely many non - singular points @xmath251 , the image @xmath226 lies on the transversal intersection of two surface patches @xmath273 and the remaining non - singular points lie on intersection of three surface patches @xmath273 where each @xmath568 corresponds to a suitable subinterval @xmath259 .    _ 
 _ it follows from proposition  [ singtrimclem ] that the singular trim points lie on @xmath341 . since at a non - singular trim point @xmath251 , @xmath569 , the proof for ( ii ) is identical to the proof for lemma  [ transinterlem ] about elementary trim curves . 
 @xmath62    note that the computation of @xmath249 above is transversal except at the known point @xmath570 , i.e. , where @xmath571 . 
 the problem then reduces to a surface - surface intersection which is transversal except at a known point . 
 this information is usually enough for most kernels to compute @xmath249 robustly . 
 figure  [ nestedfig ] schematically illustrates a scenario in which a singular p - trim curve is nested inside an elementary p - trim curve . 
 note that the sweep is non - decomposable and this will be detected by the presence of points on @xmath124 where @xmath0 is negative . 
 further , the region bounded by the singular p - trim curve needs to be excised before a surface - surface intersection algorithm can trace the elementary trim curves since no neighborhood of @xmath572 ( where @xmath0 is zero ) can be parametrized . 
 our analysis will first successfully identify and excise the region bound by the singular p - trim curve . 
 after parametrizing the remaining part , the task of excising the regions bound by elementary p - trim curves can be handled by existing kernels . 
 this paper develops a mathematical framework for the implementation of the `` generic '' solid sweep in modern solid modelling kernels . 
 this is done via a complete understanding of singularities and of self - intersections within the envelope and the notion of decomposability . 
 this in turn is done through the important invariant @xmath2 by which all trim - curves are either stable surface - surface intersections or are caught by @xmath2 . 
 we now detail certain implementation issues . 
 firstly , the use of funnel as the parametrization space and the so called `` procedural '' framework is now standard , see e.g. , the acis kernel . 
 secondly , the non - generic case in the sweep , as in blends or surface - surface intersections , will need careful programming and convergence with existing kernel methods for handling degeneracy . 
 next , while we have not tackled the case when the trim curves intersect the left / right caps , that analysis is not difficult and we skip it for want of space . finally , the non - smooth sweep is a step away . 
 the local geometry is already available . 
 the trim curves and other combinatorial / topological properties of the smooth and non - smooth case are tackled in a later paper . 
 mathematically , our framework may also extend to more complicated cases where the curves of contact are not simple . 
 this calls for a more morse - theoretic analysis which should yield rich structural insights . 
 the invariant @xmath2 is surprisingly strong and needs to be studied further . 
 in this section we briefly describe an application of solid sweep in the packaging industry where complex needs for handling products arise . 
 a few example scenarios are , orienting the products precisely as they pass along the assembly line , separating one stream of products into two streams or combing two streams into one , inverting the product as it passes along the line , introducing exact spacing between consecutive products , and so on . this is often achieved by a conveyor screw which rotates about its own axis and hence propels the product ahead which is sitting in its groove . 
 the surface of this screw is specifically designed for moving the required product along the required path . 
 see  @xcite for a video of conveyor screws which group a set of products together and introduce precise time lag between two consecutive products .    in order to design such a screw for the required object and the required motion profile , 
 the rotation of the screw is compounded into the desired motion profile . 
 the object is then swept along the resultant trajectory and the swept volume so obtained is subtracted from a cylinder to obtain the conveyor screw . 
 figure  [ screwfig ] shows the surface of a screw designed to translate a cylinder . 
 the conventional method of designing such screws involves sampling the trajectory at a finite number of positions , and taking the union of the object positioned at all these positions . the resultant  discrete "" swept volume 
 is then subtracted from the cylinder to obtain an approximate screw . 
 this is shown in figure  [ discretescrewfig ] . as expected 
 , this approach produces a large number of sliver faces and the brep structure of the resulting solid has a high degree of complexity . 
 further , the solution is neither accurate nor smooth . 
 recall the statement of proposition  8 that for @xmath51 and @xmath75 $ ] , either ( i ) @xmath77 and @xmath78 , or ( ii ) @xmath79 and @xmath80 or ( iii ) @xmath76 . 
 _ define @xmath573 and @xmath574 as @xmath575 @xmath576 and @xmath577 respectively . 
 we define the following objects in @xmath578 where the fourth dimension is time . 
 let @xmath579 and @xmath580 . 
 note that @xmath581 is a four dimensional topological manifold and @xmath582 is a three dimensional submanifold of @xmath581 . 
 further , a point @xmath583 lies in @xmath584 if @xmath92 and @xmath585 . 
 further , if @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath586 forms the boundary of @xmath581 where define the projection @xmath587 is defined as @xmath588 and the projection @xmath589 is defined as @xmath590 . 
 clearly , for a point @xmath591 , if @xmath592 then @xmath593 . 
 hence a necessary condition for @xmath385 to be in @xmath6 is that the line @xmath594 should be tangent to @xmath595 which is a three dimensional manifold which is smooth everywhere except at @xmath596 and at @xmath597 . for @xmath598 , the outward normal to @xmath595 at @xmath599 
 is given by @xmath600 and the outward normal to @xmath595 at @xmath601 is given by @xmath574 . 
 we now compute the outward normal to @xmath595 at @xmath602 . 
 the manifold @xmath582 is diffeomorphic to @xmath603 , i.e. , the cross product of @xmath22 which is a 2-dimensional manifold and @xmath25 which is a 1-dimensional manifold , with the diffeomorphism given by @xmath604 , @xmath605 . 
 hence , if @xmath606 spans @xmath607 and @xmath608 spans @xmath609 then the tangent space of @xmath603 at @xmath583 is spanned by @xmath610 and @xmath611 is spanned by + @xmath612 . 
 hence , the outward normal to @xmath595 at @xmath613 is @xmath614 . 
 consider now three cases as follows .    case ( i ) : @xmath615 . at any point @xmath616 
 there is a cone of outward normals given by @xmath617 where @xmath618 and @xmath619 . 
 so if the line @xmath594 is tangent to @xmath595 at @xmath599 then @xmath620 for some @xmath621 where @xmath622 and @xmath623 . solving the above for @xmath624 we get @xmath625 . 
 hence @xmath78 . 
 case ( ii ) : @xmath79 . 
 proof is similar to case ( i ) . 
 case ( iii ) : @xmath92 . 
 if the line @xmath594 is tangent to @xmath582 at @xmath613 there exist @xmath626 not all zero such that @xmath627 it follows that @xmath628 . 
 in other words , @xmath629 . @xmath62 
 recall the inverse trajectory of a fixed point @xmath18 as @xmath456 . 
 we will denote the trajectory of @xmath18 by @xmath630 \to \mathbb{r}^3 $ ] , @xmath631 . 
 we now note a few useful facts about @xmath457 . 
 we assume without loss of generality that @xmath236 and @xmath632 . denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath13 by @xmath633 , we have @xmath634 since @xmath635 we have , @xmath636 differentiating eq . 
 [ aso3eq ] w.r.t . 
 @xmath13 we get @xmath637 using eq . 
 [ ybardoteq ] and eq . 
 [ adottnoteq ] we get @xmath638 differentiating eq . 
 [ ybardoteq ] w.r.t . 
 time we get @xmath639 using equations  [ ybardotdoteq ] , [ adottnoteq ] and [ adotdottnoteq ] we get @xmath640 
 _ proof . _ recall the definition of function 
 @xmath468 as @xmath469 differentiating eq .  [ lambdaeq ] with respect to time and denoting derivative w.r.t . @xmath13 by @xmath633 , we get @xmath641 at @xmath615 , @xmath642 . since @xmath643 , it follows from eq . 
 [ ybardottnoteq ] that @xmath644 . 
 it is easy to verify that @xmath645 . 
 hence , @xmath646 from eq . 
 [ ddotlambdaeq ] and eq . 
 [ ybardotdottnoteq ] it follows that @xmath647 since @xmath648 for all @xmath13 in some neighbourhood @xmath649 of @xmath82 , we have that @xmath650 . hence @xmath651 . hence @xmath652 
 = @xmath653 . here 
 @xmath654 is the differential of the gauss map , i.e. the curvature tensor of @xmath655 at point @xmath18 . using this in eq . 
 [ ddotlambdatnoteq ] and the fact that @xmath656 , @xmath657 we get @xmath658 recalling that @xmath659 @xmath660 here @xmath661 and @xmath662 where @xmath654 is the shape operator ( differential of the gauss map ) of @xmath655 at @xmath473 . also , @xmath663 and @xmath664 . 
 assume without loss of generality that @xmath236 and @xmath237 , hence @xmath665 , @xmath666 and @xmath667 . 
 using eq . 
 [ adottnoteq ] and the fact that @xmath668 we get @xmath669 from eqs . 
 [ lsi2eq ] and  [ lsirelationeq ] and the fact that @xmath670 we get @xmath671 . @xmath62 
 we now describe the parametrization of @xmath672 assuming that the sweep @xmath91 is simple . 
 we obtain a procedural parametrization of @xmath673 which is an abstract way of defining curves and surfaces . 
 this approach relies on the fact that from the user s point of view , a parametric surface(curve ) in @xmath23 is a map from @xmath674(@xmath26 ) to @xmath23 and hence is merely a set of programs which allow the user to query the key attributes of the surface(curve ) , e.g. its domain and to evaluate the surface(curve ) and its derivatives at the given parameter value . 
 this approach to defining geometry is especially useful when closed form formulae are not available for the parametrization map and one must resort to iterative numerical methods . 
 we use the newton - raphson(nr ) method for this purpose . as an example , the parametrization of the intersection curve of two surfaces is computed procedurally in  @xcite . 
 this approach has the advantage of being computationally efficient as well as accurate . for a detailed discussion on the procedural framework , 
 see  @xcite . 
 the computational framework is as follows . given @xmath7 and @xmath21 , an approximate funnel is first computed , which we will refer to as the seed surface . 
 now , when the user wishes to evaluate @xmath673 or its derivative at some parameter value , a nr method will be started with seed obtained from the seed surface . 
 the nr method will converge , upto the required tolerance , to the required point on @xmath673 , or to its derivative , as required . here , the precision of the evaluation is only restricted by the finite precision of the computer and hence is accurate . 
 it has the advantage that if a tighter degree of tolerance is required while evaluation of the surface or its derivative , the seed surface does not need to be recomputed . 
 thus , for the procedural definition of @xmath673 we need the following :    1 .   an nr formulation for computing points on @xmath675 and its derivatives , which we describe in section  [ nrformsubsec ] 2 .   seed surface for seeding the nr procedure , which we describe in section  [ seedsubsec ]    recall that by the non - degeneracy assumption , @xmath675 is the union of @xmath676 . 
 this suggests a natural parametrization of @xmath675 in which one of the surface parameters is time @xmath13 . 
 we will call the other parameter @xmath9 and denote the seed surface by @xmath495 which is a map from the parameter space of @xmath675 to the parameter space of @xmath677 , i.e. @xmath678 and while the point @xmath679 may not belong to @xmath675 , it is close to @xmath675 . in other words 
 , @xmath680 is close to @xmath391 . 
 we call the image of the seed surface through the sweep map @xmath130 as the approximate envelope and denote it by @xmath681 , i.e. @xmath682 . 
 we make the following assumption about @xmath681 . 
 note that this is not a very strong assumption and holds true in practice even with rather sparse sampling of points for the seed surface . 
 we now describe the newton - raphson formulation for evaluating points on @xmath675 and its derivatives at a given parameter value . 
 recall that the points on @xmath675 were characterized by the tangency condition @xmath683 . introducing the parameters @xmath684 of @xmath675 , we rewrite this equation @xmath685 : @xmath686 so , given @xmath687 , we have one equation in two unknowns , viz . @xmath688 and @xmath689 . 
 @xmath690 is defined as the intersection of the plane normal to the iso-@xmath13(for @xmath615 ) curve of @xmath681 at @xmath691 with the iso-@xmath13(for @xmath615 ) curve of @xmath675 which is nothing but @xmath83 . 
 recall that @xmath83 is given by @xmath692 where @xmath693 obey eq . 
 [ envlcondpareq ] . 
 henceforth , we will suppress the notation that @xmath694 and @xmath695 are functions of @xmath9 and @xmath13 . 
 also , all the evaluations will be understood to be done at parameter values @xmath687 . 
 the tangent to iso-@xmath13 curve of @xmath681 at @xmath687 is given by @xmath696 hence , @xmath690 is the solution of simultaneous system of equations  [ envlcondpareq ] and  [ planeorthoeq ] @xmath697 eq . 
 [ envlcondpareq ] and eq . 
 [ planeorthoeq ] give us a system of two equations in two unknowns , @xmath118 and @xmath119 and hence can be put into nr framework by computing their first order derivatives w.r.t @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for any given parameter value @xmath687 , we seed the nr method with the point @xmath698 and solve eq . 
 [ envlcondpareq ] and eq . 
 [ planeorthoeq ] for @xmath699 and compute @xmath690 .    having computed @xmath700 
 we now compute first order derivatives of @xmath675 assuming that they exist . in order to compute @xmath701 
 , we differentiate eq . 
 [ envlcondpareq ] and eq . 
 [ planeorthoeq ] w.r.t . 
 @xmath9 to obtain @xmath702 eq . 
 [ derpeq1 ] and eq . 
 [ derpeq2 ] give a system of two equations in two unknowns , viz . 
 , @xmath703 and @xmath704 and can be put into nr framework by computing first order derivatives w.r.t . @xmath703 and @xmath704 . 
 note that eq . 
 [ derpeq1 ] and eq . 
 [ derpeq2 ] also involve @xmath118 and @xmath119 whose computation we have already described . 
 after computing @xmath703 and @xmath704 , @xmath701 can be computed as @xmath705 . 
 @xmath706 can similarly be computed by differentiating eq . 
 [ envlcondpareq ] and eq . 
 [ planeorthoeq ] w.r.t . 
 higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar manner . 
 the seed surface is constructed by sampling a few points on the funnel and fitting a tensor product b - spline surface through these points .

27,"micromanipulation of biological matter using light is of great current interest because of its relevance to fundamental research as well as applications . 
 confinement of a single cell in an optical trap is one recent example of how optically - generated forces affect cellular dynamics . 
 recent advances have enhanced the capability of applying and sensing forces and displacements with magnitudes in the piconewtons and nanometer ranges , respectively , and with corresponding sensitivities of femtonewtons and sub - nanometers . 
 optical forces that lie in the range 1 - 50 pn are capable of physically deforming a cell without causing cell death : this has been demonstrated @xcite in trapping experiments involving single red blood cells ( rbcs ) . 
 we have recently conducted experiments to investigate the behavior of live human red blood cells under optical forces generated using both linearly and circularly polarized light @xcite . 
 these experiments have shown that a normal human rbc , which has a biconcave disk shape , approximately 8 @xmath0 m in diameter , deforms into a folded shape upon being placed in an optical trap ; the trapped rbc subsequently rotates when circularly polarized laser radiation is used . 
 the rotational speed is controlled by the magnitude of the laser power that is applied . 
 experiments carried out using rbcs from mice , which have a range of diameters ( 4 - 8 @xmath0 m ) , show that the rotation speed also depends upon cell size @xcite . 
 this paper is devoted to understanding the physics behind the folding and rotation of rbcs . 
 we present here the results of a study on the optically - induced folding and rotation of a red blood cell kept under buffered conditions that are close to physiological conditions . 
 experiments that involve optically - driven processes and devices carry a distinct advantage since forces can be applied without mechanical contact . 
 consequently , there has been a resurgence of interest in optically - driven micro - motors . following the classic seven - decade - old experiment of beth @xcite , which demonstrated the conversion of optical energy into mechanical energy , leading to rotation of micron - sized quartz crystals in circularly polarized light , 
 other non - contact modes of rotation have been demonstrated in micro - structures comprising specially shaped dielectrics and birefringent particles @xcite . while the rotation induced by optical forces can be finely controlled , because it depends on parameters like incident laser power and polarization state , in hitherto existing work the stringent constraint on the shape and microfabrication of rotors continues to be a key challenge . 
 thus , experiments involving optical trapping of _ naturally occurring _ material , like a live red blood cell ( rbc ) @xcite or other single living cells @xcite is of great relevance since these obviate the need for microfabrication of special shapes . 
 the collapse of structures under compressive mechanical stress , or under their own weight , is of wide interest in many fields @xcite and such instabilities have been studied in the classical elasticity of rods and plates @xcite . 
 when a structure is subjected to compression it undergoes large displacements transverse to the load , and buckles , as can be readily demonstrated with a drinking straw or a ball pen refill . 
 the buckling process is relevant not only to macroscopic systems described by classical elasticity , but also to microscopic objects like semiflexible polymers , biological membranes and metallic films . 
 we notice here that the euler instability also affects a red blood cell placed under the delicate compressive forces of an optical trap @xcite . 
 the paper is organized as follows . 
 we first summarize our experimental observations . after presenting a brief overview , from a physics perspective , of the structural properties of rbcs 
 , we present a simple model that captures the observations that we have made in our experiments . the subsequent section deals with the predictions made by our theoretical model . 
 we end with some concluding remarks . 
 our measurements on live rbcs were conducted using a single - beam optical trap @xcite comprising a 1064 nm , 1 w diode pumped nd : yvo@xmath1 laser whose light was sharply focused with a 100x oil - immersed objective of large numerical aperture ( na=1.3 ) . 
 a red blood cell under physiological ph conditions was optically trapped within the focal volume of the beam . 
 the cell was observed to fold when subjected to a trapping force of the order of 10 pn ( corresponding to laser power of @xmath220 mw ) . upon removal of the optical trap ( blocking the laser beam ) , 
 the rbc was observed to unfold to its original biconcave shape . 
 when circularly polarized laser light was used , the folded rbc was observed to rotate @xcite . 
 the experimental observations of folding can be summarized as follows ( see fig . 
 @xmath3 ) :    1 . 
 the rbc folds in the optical trap and unfolds when the trap is off . 
 it is observed that the cell _ folds _ and does not _ 
 flip _ as can be checked from the fact that the folded rbc exhibits a width ( @xmath23.8 @xmath0 m ) that is almost twice that of the thickest part of the unfolded cell . 
 the folding time ( typically @xmath4 ) is much smaller than the unfolding time ( typically @xmath5 ) . 
 if the incident beam is linearly polarized , the long axis of the folded rbc aligns itself in the direction of the electric field of the incident trapping laser beam and faithfully follows the electric vector as the polarization is rotated . 
 the experimental observations pertaining to rbc rotation can be summarized as follows :    1 . 
 the folded rbc rotates in circularly polarized light but not in linearly polarized light . 
 the sense of rotation depends on the sense of circular polarization . 
 the rotational speed has been shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the laser power that is applied . 
 the standard picture of a red blood cell is that of a semi inflated bag containing a viscoelastic incompressible fluid , the cytoplasm . the bag is a plasma membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer containing other macromolecules , which form the cytoskeleton . 
 the cytoskeleton is a protein network whose links are spectrin filaments ( length @xmath2200 nm ) meeting at junctions of short actin filaments ( length @xmath237 nm ) . 
 other proteins like ankyrin bind the mesh as a whole to the cytoplasmic side of the phospholipid bilayer . 
 this protein network is important in determining the elastic and mechanical properties of the cell which are characterized by the elastic constants of the membrane . in particular , the elastic modulus for area compressibility @xmath6 is in the range @xmath23 - 6 @xmath7 
 10@xmath8 pn @xmath0m@xmath9 , the elastic modulus for shear @xmath10 is @xmath25 - 7 pn @xmath0m@xmath9 and the bending elastic modulus @xmath11 is @xmath210@xmath9 pn @xmath0 m @xcite . for displacements in the micron range , it is clear that the elastic energies of bend , shear and compression are in the ratio @xmath12 , that is , @xmath13 in other words , it is easier to bend the cell than to shear it and it is hardest to compress it . 
 a detailed analysis of the cell shape and elasticity of the red blood cell is presented in @xcite . 
 our focus here is to study a particular aspect of rbc elasticity which involves buckling of the cell in the presence of light forces . 
 the elastic properties of the rbc are biologically crucial as they permit it to squeeze through narrow capillaries . 
 the natural unstressed shape of the rbc is determined by the elastic properties of the membrane , its area and the enclosing volume . under the action of external forces , the red cell deforms but 
 recovers its original shape when the forces are removed . 
 the bilayer provides resistance to bending and the cytoskeleton resists shear as well as compression . 
 earlier studies of rbc elasticity have been carried out using techniques like micro - pipette aspiration , laminar shear flow , and optical stretchers . 
 we reiterate that the present study focuses on live cells , maintained under physiological conditions . 
 our experiments are distinct from a recent work on the exertion of optical forces on cells that are no longer live by virtue of the conditions of the medium in which they are maintained @xcite . 
 we find that the main experimental observations can be adequately captured by a simple model which is independent of the detailed structure of the rbc 
 . what is appealing about the model is its simplicity , that it reproduces the main experimental findings and the fact that it makes testable predictions .      in our simplified model 
 we neglect the biconcave geometry of the rbc and consider it to be a flat disk shaped elastic membrane with an energy cost for bending and deformation . 
 our model makes some testable predictions . 
 the elastic energy for the rbc disk has two terms @xcite : ( i ) the energy cost associated with the extrinsic ( mean ) curvature of the membrane , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents an area element , @xmath11 is the bending modulus , @xmath16 is the membrane s extrinsic curvature , and ( ii ) the energy cost of the strain internal to the membrane ( shear and compression ) that is given by an integral over the membrane of the square of the strain tensor and is characterized by the lam constants @xcite . 
 so , an unstrained rbc is a disk with zero intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures . we confine ourselves to the lowest energy description of the system in which we neglect the effects of shear and compression and describe the system purely in terms of the bending energy . 
 the membrane only assumes shapes with zero intrinsic curvature because it takes far greater energy to change the intrinsic geometry . 
 apart from the membrane s elastic energy there is also energy associated with the optical trap , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thickness of the membrane , @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of the rbc and @xmath20 is the local light intensity in the focal plane . the higher the intensity , the lower is the potential @xmath21 we expand the potential in a taylor series around the minimum of the potential ( @xmath22 is chosen along the direction of propagation of light ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant proportional to the incident laser power . 
 @xmath25 is lowest when the rbc is flat and unfolded . 
 @xmath26 is lowest when the rbc is at the bottom of the potential . 
 the shape of the membrane is determined by a competition between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . 
 so , when the trap is switched on , for high enough laser power the trap energy overcomes the elastic energies of the membrane and folds it , and when the laser trap is switched off , the flat state is more favorable . 
 the constraint of preserving the intrinsic geometry forces the membrane to assume a cylinder - like shape @xcite ( fig . 
 1 ) rather than any other shape that has non - zero intrinsic curvature . 
 the allowed configurations of the elastic membrane are similar to the allowed configurations of a disk made of paper : it can be bent into a cylinder , but not into a sphere as this deforms its internal geometry . 
 an analysis of the two competing energy terms shows that the threshold power needed for folding is inversely proportional to the cube of the linear dimension of the cell . this is a prediction of the model which can be tested against future experiments on this system . 
 as noted , we view the folding of the trapped rbc as an analog of the buckling instability @xcite . 
 although the rbc is modeled as a @xmath27 disk , it bends only in one direction because of the constraint of preserving intrinsic geometry and so the problem can be treated as essentially one dimensional , similar to a compressed rod . 
 we simplify the analysis by focusing on the lowest energy mode of deformation , in which the rbc assumes a shape which is part of a cylinder of radius @xmath28 . 
 we use as the order parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rbc diameter . 
 @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath32 , the unfolded state ; a non - zero @xmath33 describes a curved configuration . 
 we would expect the energy of bending to be proportional to @xmath34 , since bending in either direction costs the same amount of energy , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant related to the bending modulus . 
 similarly , the trap energy is also symmetric in @xmath33 and can be expressed as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant related to the intensity of the laser radiation . 
 the competition between @xmath25 and @xmath39 determines the stability of the folded state . 
 we now consider the rotation of a trapped rbc . from the observation that the long axis of the rbc always follows the polarization vector 
 one can infer that the folded rbc is birefringent . 
 thus it follows that in the presence of circularly polarized light the folded rbc will rotate . while this can be understood using the maxwell stress tensor of the classical electromagnetic field @xcite , we note here that the same results can be obtained in a more transparent way by invoking the spin of the photon . in passing through the folded , birefringent rbc , the light polarization changes from circular to elliptical . 
 the difference in spin angular momentum is imparted to the rbc , thus exerting a torque on it causing it to rotate . 
 the photon  spin "" is best described by the poincar sphere where for spin=1@xmath40 , the north pole ( @xmath41 ) represents right circularly polarized light with angular momentum @xmath40 while the south pole @xmath42 ) represents left circularly polarized light , with angular momentum @xmath43 . 
 linearly polarized light carries no spin angular momentum and is represented along the equator while all other points on the sphere represent elliptically polarized light . 
 the change in angular momentum caused by a single photon is equal to the change in @xmath44 and , therefore , to the change in the z - coordinate of the poincar sphere , multiplied by the unit @xmath40 of angular momentum . 
 one can express the torque as the total angular momentum transferred per unit time : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] is a dimensionless number , the change in the @xmath22 coordinate on the poincar sphere ( here @xmath18 is the thickness of the sample , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the refractive indices of the ordinary and the extraordinary ray respectively and @xmath49 is the wavelength of light used ) , n is the number of photons per second , and @xmath50 is the power of the incident light ( number of photons per second multiplied by the energy @xmath51 of each photon ) . 
 we , therefore , expect the torque that is generated to be proportional to the incident laser power as is , indeed , observed in our measurements ( fig . 
 circularly polarized light exerts a torque on the cell which causes it to rotate in the surrounding viscous medium . 
 since we are in the low ( @xmath52 1.0 ) reynold s number regime we would expect the angular velocity @xmath53 to be proportional to the torque @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the frictional drag coefficient given by @xmath57    from the observed angular velocity we calculate the torque to be large , 26 nn nm , using the value l = 7 @xmath0 m for the length of the cylinder , r=2 @xmath0 m for the radius of the cylinder and @xmath58 = 0.0013 nsm@xmath59 for the viscosity of the surrounding liquid . 
 the time scales for folding and unfolding can also be understood in our model with two parameters : the depth of the trap that is represented by @xmath38 ( experimentally controlled by the light intensity ) , and the membrane stiffness represented by @xmath36 . 
 when @xmath33 deviates from @xmath60 , it experiences a restoring force , @xmath61 . 
 note that all measurements were made at low reynolds number where viscous forces dominate over the negligible @xcite inertial forces . as in any viscous medium , 
 the force @xmath62 causes a motion whose 
 velocity "" @xmath63 is proportional to the applied force @xmath64 . from this 
 we conclude that the timescale for folding is given by @xmath65 , or in terms of the folding rate , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the critical laser power for folding . since velocities are directly proportional to forces , timescales are inversely proportional to forces 
 . the higher the force , the smaller the timescale . 
 this picture explains why the folding time is much shorter than the unfolding time . 
 the trap force induces folding and the process is fast . on turning the trap off 
 , the membrane spontaneously and slowly relaxes back to its flat state as there are no forces to keep it folded . 
 our model predicts that by controlling the light intensity one can change the folding time . 
 as the laser power is lowered , the folding time is expected to increase and at a certain low power , when the trap energy just cancels the elastic energy , we expect to see large fluctuations in the shape of the membrane . 
 this is because at this power level there is no restoring force in the @xmath33 variable . 
 the membrane is floppy and susceptible to brownian fluctuations@xcite . 
 these large shape fluctuations have been experimentally seen . 
 measurements of the dependence of the folding rate on normalized laser power are shown in fig.3 ; our results are in accord with the predictions of our model . 
 we have presented the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of folding and rotation of a rbc in an optical trap . 
 the elastic properties of the rbc are a sensitive function of the ph of the buffer solution . 
 we emphasize that our experiments were carried out under physiological conditions . 
 the main observation is that a single red blood cell , when placed in an optical trap folds into a rod - like shape ; if the trapping laser beam is circularly polarized , the folded rbc rotates . 
 we have proposed a simple model based on the notion of euler buckling instability to capture the physics of folding . the rotation of the cell is understood in terms of a simple picture involving the poincar sphere . 
 the predictions that emerge from the model have been successfully tested experimentally . 
 we notice that the orders of magnitude of the torques achieved in these experiments are significantly higher than those achieved in quartz crystals . 
 this suggests the following model for the appearance of birefringence in a cylindrically folded rbc . in the folded state , the long biomolecules constituting the cytoskeleton of the rbc , which are aligned along the axis of the cylinder contribute to birefringence somewhat like the very long organic molecules lined up in a liquid crystal to give it birefringent properties . in the unfolded state 
 the cytoskeletal biopolymers are randomly oriented in the plane transverse to the incident beam and thus do not cause birefringence . 
 further investigations are needed to confirm this model of birefringence .

 notice that we restrict ourselves to the lowest energy description that would dominate the physics of buckling . 
 one can imagine other structures , for instance , a corrugated sheet that would be consistent with the constraint of fixed intrinsic geometry but such a structure would pertain to a higher energy and is neglected in the present analysis . 
 the experimental observations also support our low energy description .",0.362741000169968,0.16883116883116803,0.632695853710174,0.240921466031697,0.09166666666666601,0.595037221908569,0.26912687658051104,0.065739570164348,0.5853608846664421,1
28,"most searches for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations ( seti ) have concentrated on radio wavelengths ( e.g. tarter 2001 , cullers 2000 , werthimer et al . 
 2000 , leigh and horowitz 2000 ) . 
 however , a preferred wavelength for seti work has proved elusive . 
 the motivation for this project stemmed from the suggestion of schwartz and townes ( 1961 ) that advanced civilizations might use optical or near  infrared lasers as an efficient means of interstellar communication ( townes 1998 , lampton 2000 ) . 
 the advantages of optical wavelengths over radio include the higher bandwidth and the narrower diffraction  limited beam size to promote private communication . 
 in addition , the technology needed to produce lasers with detectable powers is not far from current earth technology (  2.3 ) . 
 optical seti ( oseti ) projects are currently designed to detect highly energetic , pulsed lasers and continuous  wave lasers . 
 such efforts include dedicated searches , piggyback searches , and data mining . 
 many oseti projects are designed to detect pulsed lasers using fast photometry ( howard et al . 
 2000 , bhathal 2000 , werthimer et al . 
 two or three photodetectors are employed to search for laser pulses having a duration of @xmath01 ns in broadband visible light . 
 a high  powered nanosecond pulsed laser will outshine its host star during its brief pulse because at most one photon will be received ( for a typical 1-m class telescope ) from the star during the 1 ns duration . 
 alternately , interstellar optical communication may occur via nearly continuous laser emission . in that case 
 , lasers of even moderate power , tens of kilowatts , can outshine the host star when focussed by large apertures during transmission ( see  2.3 ) . here 
 we report a search for ultra narrow emission lines such as predicted by the schwartz  townes suggestion . 
 we examine high resolution spectra of 577 f , g , k , and m stars , most of which reside within 50 pc . 
 we have taken @xmath012,500 spectra using the hires echelle spectrometer on the 10m keck 1 telescope . 
 all target stars are listed in nidever et al . 
 the stellar spectra were obtained during the period 19972001 in a search for extrasolar planets using relative radial velocities . 
 we are indebted to drs . 
 r.  p.  butler and s.  s.  vogt for their contributions in obtaining these keck spectra . 
 the multiple spectra from 4000     5000     are compared to detect sharp differences such as those caused by nonnatural emission lines , as described in the following subsections . 
 the acquired echelle spectra contain 34 spectral orders , covering wavelengths 3800  6100    with resolution @xmath2 = 70,000 ( see vogt et al . 
 1994 , vogt et al . 
 2000 , butler et al . 
 not all orders are used here because the starlight is sent through a glass cell filled with iodine vapor before entering the spectrometer for use in setting the wavelength scale in the planet search . 
 the iodine lines contaminate the stellar spectrum at wavelengths greater than 4980  . 
 the remaining usable orders , 72 through 89 , contain 1000    ranging from 3980 
 this region includes balmer @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but not the caii h&k lines . 
 the pixel width is given by @xmath5 = 145,000 , corresponding to 2.1 per pixel or @xmath00.032    per pixel . 
 the actual spectral resolution is only 70,000 because the instrumental profile has a width of 2.3 pixels . 
 the recorded two  dimensional raw spectra are reduced in the usual way to one  dimensional spectra . 
 the bias is subtracted from all images including both the stellar spectra and the flat  field exposures . 
 each spectral order recorded by the ccd has a width proportional to the diameter of the stellar seeing disk along the length of the slit . 
 the typical seeing at keck / hires of 0.71.2 arcsec yields orders of width @xmath04 ccd rows ( each `` row '' being the on  chip sum of neighboring original ccd rows ) . 
 cosmic rays are removed by searching for 7@xmath6 sharp intensity spikes at one row compared to the intensity in a neighboring row ( at the same wavelength ) . 
 we are indebted to jason wright for this cosmic  ray removal algorithm . 
 the stellar spectra are divided by the flat  field exposures . 
 the two  dimensional spectral orders are compressed to one dimension by summing the recorded counts within the @xmath010 rows centered on each order . 
 we thank eric nielsen for the careful reduction of ccd images . 
 figure [ reduction ] shows the results of this process . 
 the signal  to  noise ratio per pixel in orders 72 through 89 of a typical 1-d spectrum is @xmath0200 . 
 we search for laser emission lines in the reduced spectra by comparing each spectrum to a reference spectrum of the same star , searching for statistically significant differences . over time 
 , a star s spectrum should remain nearly constant except for minor fluctuations due to photon noise and photospheric changes . 
 a large difference at one wavelength could signify the presence of a laser signal that had been detected during one observation but not during the other . 
 we would fail to detect an emission line if it occured at the same wavelength in both the observed and reference spectra . 
 a laser fired continuously from the rest frame of the stellar photosphere would go undetected . 
 however , such a continuous laser would be detected in both spectra at different wavelengths if the laser s velocity vector were to change between observations , e.g. due to orbital motion around its host star . 
 the resulting doppler shift permit detections in the difference spectrum .    for each star 
 , a series of algorithms is applied to all of its spectra . 
 first a `` reference '' spectrum is chosen . 
 then , one by one , the other `` test '' spectra are aligned in wavelength with the reference for comparison ( see  3.2 ) . 
 candidate laser lines are found in the test spectra by subtracting the reference spectrum and searching for positive differences , or `` spikes . '' 
 one test spectrum is then used as a secondary reference to check for spikes in the primary reference spectrum . 
 the spikes are subjected to a selection criterion based on their width , to ensure that their shapes are consistent with the instrumental profile of hires ( see  3.3 ) . 
 spikes that are narrower than the instrumental profile are likely to be caused by cosmic rays hitting the ccd that eluded detection in the ccd reduction process described in  2.1 .    a monochromatic laser line would have an intrinsic width narrower than the resolution of the spectrometer . however , as the laser light passes through the hires optical system , it would be smeared out by the hires point spread function ( psf ) , giving the detected emission line an apparent distribution in wavelength characteristic of the hires psf . thus candidate laser lines can be distinguished from most cosmic rays , most ccd flaws , and stellar emission lines by their predictable spread in wavelength that would be merely the hires psf , as described in detail by valenti et al . 
 notably , emission lines having widths that are narrower than possible from a star ( with its thermal , collisional , turbulent , and rotational broadening mechanisms ) would stand out as possibly `` nonastrophysical '' in origin . 
 all of the resulting candidate emission lines of any width , excluding the apparent cosmic rays hits , from the spectra of each star are stored for further analysis as described in  4 . in sections 
 3.1 ,  3.2 , and  3.3 , 
 we describe in detail the processes by which we searched for emission lines .      to be detected 
 , a laser signal must compete against the light of its host star . 
 a laser beam carries three advantages over starlight . 
 first , the laser light is concentrated in a narrow cone of tiny solid angle relative to starlight , which is omnidirectional . 
 second , a monochromatic laser line falls into one resolution element , with a width of @xmath02.3 pixels , while starlight , composed of a wide range ( @xmath04000  ) of wavelengths , is spread out into roughly 50,000 resolution elements . 
 lastly , the laser needs only to outshine the photon noise of the stellar flux , not the flux itself , within that resolution element since we are looking at differences in the spectra . to estimate these advantages of the laser signal , we consider the solid angles of the starlight and a diffraction  limited laser beam . @xmath7    here 
 @xmath8 is the wavelength of the laser light and @xmath9 is the aperture size of the laser transmitter . 
 the fraction of starlight contained within the laser beam is then given by    @xmath10    we note that the intrinsic width of a laser line will be much narrower than the hires resolution of @xmath00.075   , thereby placing most all of the laser light into a single resolution element . 
 the stellar spectral energy distribution may be approximated by a blackbody curve . for a solar  type star , 
 the sed has a width of @xmath04000   , yielding the number of resolution elements , @xmath11 , into which the stellar luminosity falls :    @xmath12    the fraction of starlight contained within one resolution element is therefore given by    @xmath13    the laser light needs only to outshine the stellar photon noise since we are detecting differences in a star s spectrum over time . 
 the photon noise relative to the flux itself , @xmath6 , for one spectrum is given by 1/(s 
 / n ) where s / n is the signal to noise ratio per resolution element . since the laser must compete with the photon noise of two spectra in one resolution element , we have    @xmath14    finally we find that the laser power necessary for an @xmath15 detection is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the luminosity of the star . as a representative case , we take @xmath8=4500   , s / n=200 , n=6 , @xmath18 w , and assume keck to keck communication so @xmath9=10 m , which gives    @xmath19    thus for this representative case , one can detect a 50 kw laser . 
 the previous calculation assumes that the laser is on continuously . 
 if , however , a nanosecond pulsed laser signal were transmitted , equations [ power1 ] and [ power2 ] would need to be multiplied by the factor @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the exposure time of the observation and @xmath22 is the number of pulses received in that time . using a typical exposure time of 10 minutes and assuming 1 pulse is received , the minimum necessary power of a detectable nanosecond pulsed laser is @xmath23 w. thus , the minimum necessary energy of a detectable nanosecond pulsed laser is 30 mj .    for comparison , 
 the most powerful continuous laser on earth is the free electron laser ( fel ) developed at jefferson laboratory in virginia . 
 the fel has reached an average power of 1.7 kw and the laser is expected to achieve average powers up to @xmath010 kw with an upgrade ( jefferson lab 2001 ) . 
 lawrence livermore national laboratory produced the world s most powerful pulsed laser , the petawatt laser . during its 440 femtosecond pulse 
 , it delivered a power greater than 10@xmath24 w ( llnl 2001 ) . 
 we can also determine a minimum detectable flux , @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the area of the laser beam at the earth and given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the distance from the laser to earth . 
 the flux limit can now be expressed as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the flux of the star . 
 if we take @xmath32 light years with the previously adopted values , the minimum flux of a detectable laser is    @xmath33    thus , we can detect monochromatic laser light from nearby stars if the flux is at least @xmath34  w / m@xmath35 at earth . 
 a detailed description of the algorithms developed to analyze the spectra is given in this section . 
 two reference spectra are required for each star . 
 the primary reference spectrum is compared to all the other test spectra . 
 the second is compared to the primary reference spectrum . 
 since only positive differences are considered , any candidate laser lines in the first reference would not be flagged during its comparison with the test spectra . a second reference , one of the previous test spectra , is used to account for this possibility . 
 the two reference spectra are chosen as follows . 
 almost every star has at least one `` template '' spectrum . in the planet 
 search project , the stellar radial velocities are measured with respect to the template spectra . 
 these observations are of good quality with high signal  to  noise ratios . 
 if there are multiple  template spectra for a star , the two with the highest signal to noise are chosen as the reference spectra . 
 if there is only one template , it is used as the primary reference spectrum and another observation with high signal to noise is chosen as the second reference . 
 some stars which are new to the extrasolar planet search catalog do not yet have templates . 
 for these stars , the two observations with the highest signal to noise are chosen as the references . 
 aligning a pair of spectra precisely in both wavelength and flux is important . 
 if the spectra are exactly the same , except for minor fluctuations due to photon noise , the fractional standard deviation , @xmath6 , of the difference spectrum is expected to be    @xmath36    where ( s / n)@xmath37 and ( s / n)@xmath38 are the signal  to  noise ratios of the two spectra . for two spectra with signal  to  noise ratios of 300 , @xmath6 can , in principle , be as low as 0.005 . 
 it is important to align the two spectra well enough such that the observed error is as close to the theoretical error as possible in order to detect the smallest differences . 
 we line up a pair of spectra order by order . 
 various normalization and shifting algorithms are applied to both the reference and test spectra , as follows . 
 the first step is to put the orders on roughly the same flux scale by dividing by the continuum . 
 the continuum is found by first partitioning an order into 10 bins . each bin is assigned a temporary continuum at the 85th percentile in flux . 
 a third  order polynomial is fit to these individual continua to normalize the entire spectral order . 
 each spectrum is doppler  shifted to correct for the earth s orbital motion , which causes a maximum wavelength shift of @xmath01    corresponding to @xmath030 pixels . 
 we determine the doppler shift of the test spectrum relative to the reference spectrum by minimizing @xmath39 , and then shift the test spectrum so that the two are aligned . 
 the final shifts are precise to @xmath00.01 pixel , and fractional pixel displacements of the spectra are accomplished with a spline interpolation . 
 this shifting is first carried out on segments of length 280 pixels , and then it is done on a 40pixel scale ( `` chunks '' ) . if any spectrum contains cosmic rays ( or laser emission lines ) , it is difficult to align . 
 such features are removed temporarily ( replaced with a spline interpolation ) to carry out the alignment . 
 operating on chunks of 40 pixels allows us to account for the wavelength dependence of the doppler shift and to correct any slopes in the flux with wavelength . 
 the resulting ( temporarily spike  free ) reference and test spectra are subtracted to yield a difference spectrum , from which the standard deviation is determined and recorded as the `` noise '' for each spectral chunk . 
 finally the reference and test spectra are subtracted with all spikes included , leaving a difference chunk which can be searched for laser  line candidates . 
 figure 2 shows a chunk of difference spectrum both with ( top ) and without ( bottom ) flux spikes of unidentified origin 
 .      a laser beam would travel through the telescope and the hires spectrometer optics just as starlight would . 
 moreover , the laser beam travels through the same column of earth s atmosphere , acquiring the same wavefront distortions and seeing profile as does the star . 
 therefore , an emission line from a laser would span the whole width of a spectral order ( perpendicular to dispersion ) as would the stellar spectrum on the ccd . 
 while the intrinsic width of the laser line in wavelength would be smaller than the resolution of hires , it would be broadened by the point 
 spread function of hires . 
 the b1 slit used in hires projects to a width of 2.0 pixels on the ccd . 
 the instrumental profile of hires from both its optics and the slit width is known from careful measurements ( valenti et al . 1995 ) and from simple gaussian fitting of emission lines from a thorium - argon lamp . 
 the instrumental profile with our hires setup has a width of 2.3 pixels ( fwhm ) . 
 thus , we expect any laser line to have an observed width of 2.3 pixels . 
 we search for candidate emission lines in the stellar spectra as follows . 
 each 40pixel chunk of difference spectrum has a corresponding fractional photon noise , @xmath6 , associated with it as described in  3.2 . 
 we pass through all the chunks and note spikes having heights above @xmath40 . 
 this threshold is chosen to exclude essentially all noise but detect a signal from a laser with the lowest detectable power . 
 we also require that candidate laser lines exhibit a width that is at least as broad as the hires instrumental profile , with fwhm=2.3 pixels , allowing us to discriminate against ( i.e. , reject ) cosmic  ray hits . 
 most cosmic rays produce electrons in a single pixel or occasionally in two neighboring pixels , clearly narrower than the hires psf . to implement this `` width '' criterion 
 , we require that the shorter of the two adjacent pixels on either side of each 6@xmath6 spike contain at least 30% of the photons in that central spike . 
 examination of the known hires psf and thorium comparison lines ( see figure [ thor ] ) shows that this width criterion would be met by almost any emission line that had been broadened by the hires psf . any spike in the difference spectrum that does not meet both the 6@xmath6 height criterion and this width criterion 
 is rejected from future consideration as they are probably cosmic rays . 
 spikes that do meet both criteria are stored in a database that includes the location and characteristics of that spike , for later statistical analysis (  4 ) . 
 we note that emission lines having widths _ greater _ than the psf will be detected and stored as candidate signals . 
 thus our survey would detect intermittent emission lines of any origin , laser or astrophysical , if they are sufficiently strong . 
 the spectral analysis described in  3 yields a database of surviving candidate emission lines in each of the @xmath012,500 keck spectra of our 577 target stars . a typical star has @xmath013 surviving candidate emission lines in its @xmath020 spectra . for each candidate 
 , the database contains the star , date of observation , the wavelength , the peak number of photons , and the width of the candidate line . 
 detailed examination shows that most ( if not all ) of the surviving candidate emission lines are simply cosmic ray hits that we had failed to reject .    to discriminate a true emission line from these cosmic rays 
 , we apply a statistical analysis on the collection of emission 
 line candidates from all spectra ( typically 20 ) for a given star . 
 we search for an overabundance of candidates ( `` hits '' ) in the vicinity of any particular wavelength . 
 in contrast , cosmic rays would hit at random locations on the ccd , and would not favor any particular wavelength . 
 a clustering of hits near one wavelength from all the spectra of one star could indicate laser emission . 
 we note that the earth s orbital motion will not cause a doppler shift of the laser line in our analysis , as we have already forceably shifted the reference and test stellar spectra onto the same wavelength scale (  3 ) . however , 
 acceleration of the emitter relative to the star ( such as due to orbital motion ) during the typical 4 years of observations would cause the laser line to be doppler  shifted to neighboring wavelengths . 
 we make a grid representing the ccd with the spectral orders partitioned into approximately 30 segments of roughly 100 pixels each . 
 the segments overlap one another by half of their size to account for the possibility of an abundance of hits split into two neighboring segments . 
 we record the number of emission 
 line candidates in each segment .    for each star , we plot the number of 100pixel segments against the number of hits in the segments . 
 most segments have no hits at all , and only a few have one hit . these infrequent hits ( none or one hit out of @xmath020 observations in a wavelength segment ) are consistent with random cosmic ray hits . to this histogram , 
 we fit a poisson distribution ( see figure [ hist ] ) , and determine the probabilities of finding an excess number of hits , @xmath41 , in any wavelength segment . a star exhibiting an excess number of hits in a segment , 
 i.e. a low probability of the events occurring randomly , would stimulate further investigation as a potential emission line . 
 the fit of a poisson distribution to the histogram of hits is done as follows . 
 we fit the low@xmath41 ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) portion of the histogram and neglect the high@xmath41 tail . 
 this approach avoids contaminating the poisson mean , @xmath42 , with actual emission lines in the high@xmath41 tail . 
 the first empty bin in the histogram , @xmath43 , is determined and an estimate of the expected mean number of hits per segment , @xmath42 , is calculated neglecting those segments with @xmath44 . 
 the poisson probability of finding @xmath41 cosmic ray hits in any given wavelength segment is given by ( taylor 1982 ) :    @xmath45    using the estimated @xmath42 , we calculate @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and check if any of the probabilities are less than 1% . 
 if so , we exclude those bins from the fit as well if @xmath48 . 
 the fit is then applied to bins from @xmath49 to some @xmath50 hits . 
 the estimated mean number of hits per segment may not necessarily yield a poisson distribution that gives the best fit to the observed histogram . 
 the best poisson fit may be better determined by finding the lowest @xmath39 given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the observed number of segments containing @xmath41 candidate hits and @xmath53 is the expected number with @xmath41 hits , based on a poisson distribution . the only free parameter is @xmath42 , the mean number of hits per segment . 
 we vary @xmath42 to find the value corresponding to the minimum of @xmath39 . 
 the resulting poisson probabilities are multiplied by the total number of segments and adopted as the best fit to the observed histogram . 
 we now determine the probabilities of finding @xmath41 hits in any given segment , extrapolating beyond @xmath50 . 
 segments having an excessive number of hits with probabilities less than 0.01% are noted as serious candidate emission lines , as they occur in excess numbers above the background cosmic ray hits . 
 since there are about 500 wavelength segments on our grid of the ccd for each star , we expect to flag one in 20 stars spuriously , i.e. due to a chance coincidence of cosmic rays .    we find that indeed 45 stars were flagged as having a wavelength segment with an excess number of hits at the 0.01% false - alarm level . 
 each of the surviving flagged candidate laser lines , of which there were 187 , were examined by eye in the raw ccd images . 
 our search for intermittent emission lines revealed an apparent detection for the star hd29528 ( k0v ) . 
 three separate spectra obtained on different dates contained strong candidates at the same wavelength . 
 the hits were noted in both of two overlapping spectral segments for this star . the probability that these three apparent emission lines were merely spurious cosmic rays occurring within a segment of length @xmath0200 km s@xmath54 is easily calculated from the poisson occurrence of cosmic rays (  4 ) . 
 figure [ hist ] shows the observed histogram of the number of segments versus number of hits along with the best fitting poisson distribution . 
 the probability of randomly obtaining 3 hits in a segment for this star is 1.23 @xmath55 10@xmath56 or 1 in 8 million . 
 figure [ las1 ] shows these candidate laser lines in the reduced spectra of the three observations . 
 the aligned reference and test spectra are shown and twice the difference spectra are below them . the candidate laser lines are in spectral order 83 and the central peaks are in pixel 1436 with respect to the reference spectrum . 
 we examined the raw spectra to see if the candidate laser lines span the whole width of the spectral order , indicating whether the light passed through the telescope and spectrometer . 
 figure [ fakelas ] shows the raw ccd image of the spectrum of hd29528 obtained on jd 2451793.1 , centered on the first candidate laser line . 
 the reference spectrum is shown below it . beneath the reference 
 is the raw difference spectrum making it easier to see the apparent laser line . 
 the other two candidate laser lines found in observations obtained on jd 2451882.98 and on jd 2451884.08 are not shown , but those apparent emission lines also span the width of the spectral order . because all three hits occur at the same pixel ( and hence wavelength ) with respect to the star s reference spectrum , and because they span the entire width of the spectral order , the hits are unlikely to be cosmic rays . 
 these are surviving laser line candidates thus far in the analysis .    to further investigate these candidate emission lines in hd29528 
 , we compared the spectrum of hd29528 to the solar spectrum using `` _ the solar spectrum 2935    to 8770   _ '' ( moore et al.@xmath571966 ) . 
 the rest wavelengths of the lines are 4307.31    and there are no listed absorption lines due to the earth s atmosphere nor anomalous solar emissions lines at this wavelength . 
 we further examined the spectrum of a rapidly rotating b  type star taken on the same night as the reference spectrum for hd29528 . 
 the b star spectrum should have no prominent spectral features . 
 a strange drop in flux of 20% is seen in the spectrum , exactly at pixel 1436 in order 83 , precisely where the hits were found with respect to the reference spectrum of hd29528 ( see figure [ bstar ] ) . 
 this clearly spurious feature in the b star strongly suggests that our candidate laser lines are merely artifacts caused by a flaw in the ccd . 
 indeed , a close examination of the raw ccd image of the reference spectrum of hd29528 shows the flaw in the ccd ( see figure [ flaw ] ) . 
 this flaw is certainly the source of the false detection .    as a side note to this false detection of an emission line 
 , one may calculate the necessary power of a laser that could have produced a `` signal '' similar to that detected . in eqn [ power1 ] 
 we assume a transmitter aperture , @xmath9=10 meters . 
 the other variables are known . 
 the wavelength of the 13@xmath6 `` signal '' is 4307   , and the signal  to  noise ratio of the spectra is @xmath0120 . 
 the luminosity of a k0 star is 0.42 @xmath58 ( carroll and ostlie 1996 ) . using these values in equations [ power1 ] 
 , we find @xmath59 kw 
 . this would be the required power of a laser to produce the spurious signal in figure [ fakelas ] . 
 this test supports our expectation that lasers having power of 50 kw would have been detected . 
 for each of the 45 stars that exhibited an excess of candidate emission lines ( above the cosmic ray background noise ) we examined the original raw ccd images from hires . 
 approximately 200 raw spectra were examined to follow up on the 45 flagged stars . 
 stellar emission lines were detected in the spectra of two flare stars , hip5643 ( m4.5 ) and hip92403 ( m3.5 ) . 
 both stars exhibited varying emission of the balmer line h@xmath3 . 
 interestingly , many candidate emission lines were located along the steep slopes of absorption lines in the reduced spectra . however , the corresponding emission spikes were not apparent in the raw ccd image . 
 such emission spikes are apparently neither cosmic rays nor emission lines . 
 instead , it is likely that these spikes located in absorption lines are caused simply by tiny changes in the instrumental profile of hires from one observation to the next . 
 the changes in the instrumental profile could result from different atmospheric seeing of the star image at the slit ( making the slit effectively a different size ) or from small focus changes in hires itself . 
 the steep sides of absorption lines have local intensities that are very sensitive to the instrumental profile . 
 it is also possible that the spikes located in absorption lines are residual numerical artifacts from the spectral alignment process since interpolation routines normally give the largest errors on steep slopes . 
 thus these candidate emission spikes located within absorption lines were rejected as spurious . 
 all other candidate emission lines were visually inspected and found to be inconsistent with actual emission lines . some were multiple , surviving cosmic rays that occurred , by chance , near the same wavelength . 
 some emission spikes were caused by bad pixels or flaws in the ccd . _ 
 no lines consistent with laser emission were found in any of our stars . _ 
 we would have detected time 
 varying emission lines from any of the 577 main sequence stars above a threshold of a few percent of the continuum flux . 
 emission lines of constant intensity would also have been detected had they doppler  shifted relative to the star during the @xmath04 yr of observations . 
 lines having intrinsic widths from arbitrarily narrow to tens of would have been detected . 
 no narrow lines consistent with laser emission were detected . 
 however , naturally occurring emission lines were found in the spectra of two stars . 
 emission lines in the spectra of solar  type stars are rare between 4000     5000   . 
 such lines can arise occasionally in the chromospheres or coronae of the most magnetically active stars . in some ( @xmath020% ) 
 f , g , k  type main sequence stars , the cores of the balmer absorption lines are `` filled in '' by a few percent due to chromospheric emission ( herbig 1985 , robinson , cram , & giampapa 1990 ) . 
 we would have detected temporal variation in that chromospheric filling , if it exceeded a few percent of the continuum level . 
 no such variations were detected in any of our f , g , k  type main sequence stars . 
 this nondetection indicates that such chromospheric variation in the cores of the strong balmer lines , notably h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 , did not exceed a few percent of the continuum level in these stars . 
 flare stars , most of spectral type m0 or later , more commonly exhibit emission of h@xmath3 . indeed , we detected time 
 varying emission of h@xmath3 in two m  type flare stars . 
 varying emission lines from stars may also arise from infalling volatile material and comets , as is observed for @xmath3 pic ( see for example beust et al . 
 our search would have detected such astrophysical emission lines if they appeared or varied by more than a few percent of the continuum flux of the star . 
 all such astrophysical origins for emissions lines would yield line widths greater than our resolution of 5 due to the usual thermal and turbulent broadening , as well as possible rotational and collisional broadening . hence such lines would be resolved . 
 nonetheless , no emission lines due to these effects were found in the 577 stars at our threshold of a few percent of continuum flux . 
 the entrance slit of the hires spectrometer is rectangular with dimensions 0.57 @xmath55 3.5 arcsec . at the typical distance of our stars of @xmath050 pc 
 , this slit corresponds to 30175 au at the star . 
 thus , sources of emission lines residing within 30 au of our target stars would have been included in our spectra . 
 of course , the emission beam must be pointed toward the keck telescope for detection . 
 extinction from interstellar dust is negligible toward these target stars due to their proximity ( @xmath60100 pc ) . 
 the motivation for this search stemmed from the suggestion of schwartz and townes ( 1961 ) that advanced civilizations might communicate from one colony to another within a planetary system , or from one planetary system to another , by using optical lasers as the carrier . 
 the advantages of optical communication over radio include its higher bandwidth and its smaller diffraction beam to promote private communication .    a nondetection of extraterrestrial intelligence carries no value unless it excludes a plausible model of life in the universe . 
 one might imagine the following model . 
 the milky way galaxy has an age of @xmath010 gyr , while only 4.6 gyr were required to spawn a technological species on earth . 
 approximately half of the stars in the galactic disk are older than the sun , and they formed with comparable amounts of heavy elements . 
 approximately 50% of these old disk stars do not have a stellar companion within 100 au ( duquennoy and mayor 1991 ) , thereby permitting stable planetary orbits . 
 therefore , @xmath025% of the stars in the galactic disk have requisite characteristics of adequate age , chemical composition , and dynamical quiescence to serve as sites for the development of technological species . 
 the anthropocentric nature of these stellar criteria are apparent , and thus serve merely as a useful guide for a model .    coincidentally , 
 the target stars used here are systematically middle  aged or older and void of close companions . they were selected for the doppler planet search at keck from among stars in the solar neighborhood . 
 they were chosen to have ages greater than 2 gyr , as judged from the caii h&k chromospheric emission line , because of the resulting photospheric stability of older stars . 
 moreover the target stars have no known stellar companions within 2 arcsec ( typically @xmath050 au ) to prevent any companion s light from entering the spectrometer slit ( but see vogt et al . 
 2002 and nidever et al . 
 2002 for a few recently detected , but negligibly bright , close companions ) . 
 moreover , spectroscopic analyses of the stellar spectra show that 90% of the target stars contain amounts of heavy elements that are within a factor of 2 of the solar value ( [ fe / h ] = -0.3 to + 0.3 ; d.a.fischer , private communication ) . 
 thus , the majority of the 577 target stars for this seti search are older than the sun , have roughly solar chemical composition , and have no perturbing stellar companions within 50 au . 
 this stellar sample is clearly biased . 
 thus our observations test a limited model of the galaxy in which older , single stars harbor technological civilizations . 
 the speculative model posits that some fraction of these target stars contain civilizations that sent probes to , or established colonies on , planets , moons or other platforms either in their host planetary system or in other systems . 
 this model of behavior , albeit anthropocentric , stems from the tendencies of homo sapiens toward exploration . to communicate with such probes or colonies over distances of astronomical units to parsecs , 
 some fraction of these civilizations might be modeled as using electromagnetic waves , including optical lasers . 
 we model the solid angle subtended by laser beams as follows . 
 some fraction , @xmath61 , of the total number of target stars , @xmath62=577 , harbor technological civilizations . on average 
 each such civilization emits some number of laser beams , n@xmath63 , perhaps in arbitrary directions . 
 we consider that each beam subtends an average solid angle @xmath64 . 
 the total solid angle , @xmath65 , subtended by all arbitrarily oriented beams is    @xmath66    we ignore here details of overlap of the beams , their actual distribution of power and beam size , and any purposeful aiming toward or away from us . 
 any properties of the lasers that are constructed with the earth as a consideration could drastically change the probability of interception of such beams .    in our survey 
 , we have monitored @xmath67= 577 stars . 
 the nondetection obtained in the survey here suggests that the total solid angle subtended by lasers emitting 50 kw or more is constrained as @xmath68 sr . 
 thus for arbitrarily directed beams , we constrain the model as    @xmath69    the nondetection reported here suggests lasers emitting detectable power must satisfy the above constraint for the combination of @xmath61 , @xmath70 , @xmath64 . 
 apparently , advanced civilizations communicating by kilowatt optical lasers are not so common as to fill 4@xmath71 sr .    as a touchstone 
 , we consider the case of the diffraction 
 limited laser with an aperture of 10-m ( keck  to  keck ) , giving a solid angle for one beam , @xmath72 sr . for transmitters of such aperture 
 , a laser emitting 50 kw would be detectable . 
 for this case , each star would have to emit @xmath73 arbitrarily oriented beams on average , each with power @xmath74 50 kw , in order that one would likely be oriented , serendipitously , toward us . 
 clearly , the observed nondetection implies that such numerous , narrow beams , however implausible , do not exist in sufficient numbers to permit likely detection . 
 these observations offer a poor constraint on lasers of arbitrary orientation , as their solid angles are simply too small in this model . 
 one might consider a galactic model consisting of wider laser beams , enhancing the chances of interception . in that case , the present nondetection would impose a constraint of fewer lasers emanating from the target stars , but would require proportionally higher power per laser for detection at 6@xmath6 above the stellar continuum . 
 more meaningfully , the nondetection reported here suggests that none of the 577 target stars harbors a civilization that has purposefully directed a laser with @xmath7550 kw toward earth ( for the case of a 10meter diffraction  limited transmitting aperture ) . 
 this modest detection threshold of 50 kw highlights the ease with which an advanced civilization could signal us , if desired . 
 but such is apparently not the case .

29,"wave propagation and modal analysis for linear arrays of electrically polarizable particles were studied in many publications @xcite . in its most basic form  a linear array of isotropic electric particles  the structure supports two independent modes : transverse modes , where the dipole moments are polarized perpendicular to the chain axis , and longitudinal modes for which the dipoles are polarized along the chain axis . 
 in addition , it was shown that for the transverse modes , there is always a portion of the dispersion curve that runs adjacent to the light - line . 
 modes associated with this part of the dispersion , termed as the light - line modes , are typically very wide and resemble a plane wave interacting very weakly with the particle chain @xcite , and are hardly excitable @xcite . 
 if the inter - particle distance @xmath0 is much smaller than the surrounding free - space wavelength @xmath1 , then the typical modal width away from the light - line ( i.e. at wavenumbers @xmath2 ) is also much smaller than @xmath1 and the mode decays exponentially away from the chain @xcite . 
 hence these structures are often called _ sub - diffraction chains _ ( sdc ) . 
 sdc s were suggested as potential candidates for ultra - narrow optical waveguides , junctions , couplers @xcite , as one - way guiding structures and optical isolators @xcite , and as leaky - wave antennas @xcite . 
 electric - magnetic and bi - isotropic particles , characterized by both electric and magnetic response were also studied extensively . in most cases , 
 the context of these studies was the reflection , transmission and absorption properties of planar arrays of such particles under external plane - wave excitation , both reciprocal @xcite and non - reciprocal @xcite . 
 3d arrays of scalar magneto - electric particles were studied in @xcite , where the full inter - particle electric and magnetic coupling has been taken into account and the effect of array packaging on the electromagnetic modes has been studied . 
 such 3d arrays were also studied in @xcite in the context of homogenization techniques , and it has been shown that the homogenized material may possess negative index properties even if the microscale inclusions are made of conventional material ( e.g. spherical particles made of material with positive scalar @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) . magnetic crystals ( either 1d or 2d , respectively ) with various models and interaction schemes taking into account short range and/or long range inter - particle interactions , were also considered @xcite . 
 not much attention was given to the guiding properties of magneto - electric particle arrays , either in 1d or 2d . in the present work , we investigate the microscopic modal properties of such particle chains in vacuum . 
 it is shown that the chain can support simultaneously ( i.e. at the same frequency ) right - handed modes ( rhm ) and left - handed modes ( lhm ) of transverse - polarization . 
 this is to contrast with the 3d arrays in @xcite where the left - handedness and right - handedness are mutually exclusive . 
 the lhm are supported by the structure even if the chain s particles possess positive polarizabilities and no bi - isotropy ; the needed structural bi - isotropy is provided by the propagator instead of the particle s local properties . 
 in contrast to the regular transverse rhm in purely electric particle chains , the transverse lhm dispersion lacks the light - line branch discussed above since their dipolar features are not aligned with the electromagnetic fields of a right - handed plane - wave solution in free space . 
 we study the modal confinement of the lhm and rhm around the chain , and show that the spatial width of the lhm is significantly smaller than that of the rhm . 
 this is intuitively expected since the surrounding free - space is inherently right - handed and therefore it is less `` susceptive '' to the lhm . 
 hence , the chains studied here may be better suited for dense packaging of photonic systems . 
 we use the z - transform method to study the chains s excitation , and show that it possesses asymmetries that can be used to eliminate unwanted reflections from chain s termination , paving the way to use the chain as a new kind of leaky wave antenna . 
 the structure of the paper is as follows . 
 the formulation , based on the discrete dipole approximation , is presented in sec . 
 the transverse modes are discussed in sec . 
 [ sec_transmodes ] , where the corresponding dispersions , the existence of lhm and rhm , and the chain s eigenstates asymmetries are explored . a rigorous excitation theory , based on the z transform , is outlined in sec .  [ sec_excit ] 
 where the asymmetric excitation is presented and discussed , and exploited to eliminate back - reflection from a chain s termination . 
 concluding remarks are provided in sec . 
 consider the linear array of equally spaced isotropic particles shown in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] .     material , and no coupling between @xmath5 occurs within the material.,width=264 ]    the inder - particle distance is @xmath0 , and the particle diameter is much smaller than the wavelength @xmath1 at which the structure is supposed to operate . 
 hence , the individual particle response to electromagnetic excitation is appropriately described by its polarizability matrix @xmath6 . 
 we further assume that the particles possess electric and magnetic response only , with no bi - isotropic or bi - anisotropic properties ( a simple example for such particles is a sphere made of conventional @xmath3 and @xmath4 material . ) 
 the corresponding @xmath6 is a @xmath7 matrix , describing the relation between the _ local _ electromagnetic field @xmath5 ( the field at the particle s location in the absence of the particle ) and the electric and magnetic dipole moments excited in the particle @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    where , in the quasi - static approximation @xmath11    and where in @xmath6 above we have used the unified notations defined in @xcite . for convenience 
 they are summarized in appendix [ app_uni ] . 
 unless otherwise stated , all bold - italic quantities here and henceforth represent column vectors , and underlined quantities represent matrices . 
 @xmath12 is a @xmath13 identity matrix . for a chain of identical particles , the chain dynamics 
 is governed by the infinite matrix equation @xmath14 where @xmath15^t$ ] is the incident field at the location of the @xmath16-th particle . 
 @xmath17 is a @xmath7 matrix representation of the green s dyadic , discussed in appendix [ app_gz ] and given by eqs . 
 ( [ eqappb_1])([eqappb_2b ] ) there . 
 it consists of the four @xmath18 submatrices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . 
 the diagonal elements of @xmath20 vanish ; this is a direct manifestation of the fact that the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) field generated by the dipole @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) vanishes along the dipole axis . 
 in fact , the structure of @xmath17 indicates that the chain supports four independent polarizations ,    1 . 
 [ longe ] longitudinal electric mode : @xmath25 . 
 the chain electrodynamics has been studied thoroughly . 
 the modes were studied in e.g.  @xcite . 
 excitation ( green s function ) theory has been developed in @xcite . 
 [ longh ] longitudinal magnetic mode : @xmath26 . essentially the same as the point above . 
 [ mixed ] transverse coupled ( mixed ) mode : @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath29,@xmath30 . 
 it will be formulated and studied below . 
 [ mixed2 ] transverse coupled ( mixed ) mode : @xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath33,@xmath34 . 
 the same as in [ mixed ] . 
 an important feature to note here is that there is a coupling between the magnetic and electric dipoles : an _ electric _ dipole @xmath35 excited by the local electric field @xmath36 in a given particle , generates both @xmath24 and @xmath23 radiation fields . then the @xmath23 field excites _ magnetic 
 _ dipoles @xmath37 in the neighboring particles . 
 hence , this coupling is _ non - local _ in the sense that it is provided only by the field propagator and not by the properties of the chain s particles ; the latter lack intrinsic bi-(an)isotropy . in view of the above 
 , we turn to study the transverse mixed modes . 
 since we are interested only with the transverse modes , we truncate eq .  [ eq2 ] using it s 1,5 rows only , yielding    @xmath38    where @xmath39    where we have used the identities @xmath40 and @xmath41 [ see eqs . 
 ( [ eqappb_1])([eqappb_3 ] ) ] . 
 we have also truncated @xmath42 in the same manner , @xmath43 . 
 the modes supported by the structure are the solutions of eq . 
 ( [ eq2 ] ) with no external forcing ( @xmath44 ) . 
 using floquet s theorem with @xmath45^t$ ] @xmath46 and the dynamic equation reduces to the @xmath47 system    @xmath48    with @xmath49\ ] ]    @xmath50 contain all the needed summations , given in eqs . 
 ( [ eqappb_5a])([eqappb_5e ] ) in appendix [ app_gz ] with @xmath51 . 
 they incorporate all dipole - dipole interactions in this system , both short and long range . 
 this physical fact is manifested mathematically by the dependence of @xmath50 on the polylogarithm functions as detailed in the appendix , rather then on an inverse polynomial . 
 @xmath52 is the two - elements column vector @xmath53 . to obtain the dispersion for guided modes , 
 we look the values of _ real _ @xmath54 in the domain @xmath55 ( outside of the light - cone ) for which the determinant of eq . 
 ( [ eq5a ] ) vanishes . for lossless particles 
 , this condition guarantees the existence of solutions to the dispersion equation with @xmath56=0 $ ] . using the properties pointed out by eqs . 
 ( [ eqappb_6a])([eqappb_8b ] ) in appendix [ app_gz ] , we note that the imaginary part of @xmath57 cancels out with the @xmath58 radiation damping factor ( see also analysis in @xcite ) , and that in this domain @xmath59 is pure real . 
 the dispersion equation can then be simplified into @xmath60\\ & \times \left[(k^3\alpha_{mm})^{-1}-\re\left\{a_t\right\ } \right]-b^2=0 \end{split } \label{eq6}\ ] ] for simplicity we choose to focus on a case for which the particles are _ balanced _ : @xmath61 . 
 balanced particles have been considered for meta - surfaces applications in many previous publications - see refs . 
 the realization of particles having both electric and magnetic response is possible even if we use simple dielectric materials . 
 dielectric spheres possess both electric and magnetic dipole resonances in positive values of @xmath3 which can be used as a simple platform to implement such systems , as reported in @xcite . 
 tuning the different electric and magnetic dipole reosnances is possible via various geometrical transformations of the inclusions , as can be seen in @xcite , and can be utilized in the design of balanced particles . 
 this choice of particle simplifies our analysis and allows further reduction of the dispersion into two simple and distinct branches @xmath62 termed accordingly as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . 
 the dispersions are shown in fig . 
 the inter - particle distance is chosen such that @xmath65 . 
 the dispersion is shown for positive @xmath54 values , and since the system is symmetric we will have the mirror image for negative @xmath54 ( albeit the roles of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are switched ) .    , where @xmath66 is the free - space wavenumber . 
 left - handed modes  the @xmath64 dispersion curve  exist also for positive real polarizabilities.,width=302 ]    formally , there are four eigenvector solutions to eq . 
 ( [ eq5a ] ) . 
 examining eq . 
 ( [ eq5a ] ) together with the dispersion condition in eq . 
 ( [ eq7 ] ) , one finds that there are two doubly - degenerate modes ( ddm ) . 
 each ddm consists of two modes with the same dispersion , as expected from the symmetry of the chain in the @xmath67 plane . 
 the dipole structure of each ddm is given by [ note the definition of the vector @xmath68 in eq . 
 ( [ eq1a ] ) ]    @xmath69    or @xmath70    where @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 this degenerate mode is in fact the independent polarizations described in points [ mixed ] and [ mixed2 ] in sec . 
 [ form ] . clearly , there are also two possible ddm s , the difference between them stems from the different choices of @xmath71 above .      from eqs . 
 ( [ eq8a])([eq9 ] ) it follows that @xmath73 therefore along the dispersion branch @xmath63 ( @xmath74 ) the mode possesses a conventional right - hand ( rh ) structure . 
 however , along @xmath64 , where @xmath75 , the mode is _ left - handed _ ( lh ) . 
 as pointed out above , the corresponding dispersion curves are shown in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , and it is evident that lh modes can exist also for positive polarizability . 
 it is interesting to note that the rh mode dispersion ( @xmath63 in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] ) possesses the well known light - line branch that is external and adjacent to the light - line cone . 
 this is very similar to the light - line transverse mode observed previously in e.g. ref . 
 the corresponding electromagnetic wave interacts very weakly with the chain . 
 it is spatially wide and possesses a plane - wave like structure . 
 the mode dispersion is @xmath76 , very close to that of a plane - wave . 
 to contrast , the lh mode possesses the @xmath64 dispersion curve . due to 
 its left - handedness it can not be matched to the electromagnetic field supported by the surrounding vacuum . 
 hence for this dispersion the light - line branch does not exist as can also be seen in fig . 
 we emphasize again that the left - handedness exists even when both polarizabilities ( electric and magnetic ) are positive . 
 this regime does not exist in regular , electric particle chains and is the result of the field propagator coupling between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . 
 it is instructive to examine the spatial width of the electromagnetic field around the chain associated with each of these modes . 
 the electric field is given by @xmath77 { \mbox{\boldmath$ \pi$}}_n\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the location of the @xmath16-th particle , @xmath79 is any location off the chain particles , and where @xmath80 in @xmath81 satisfy the eigen - vector conditions of eqs . 
 ( [ eq8a])([eq9 ] ) . 
 this series can be evaluated with the aid of the poisson summation formula . to estimate the mode width , it is sufficient to observe the leading term in the formula , that yields for @xmath82 and for @xmath83 @xmath84 \end{split}\ ] ] where @xmath85 . 
 the electric field of the lhm or rhm is obtained by using the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath71 . 
 recall that for the guided mode @xmath86 
 so @xmath87 is real . for large @xmath88 
 the expression above decays essentially as @xmath89 away from the chain . 
 hence the characteristic width of the mode is @xmath90 . from the dispersion curves of the lhm and rhm shown in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] it is seen that always @xmath91 . 
 hence , the lh mode is always more confined to the chain . 
 this is intuitively expected , since the surrounding vacuum is a right - handed environment and hence is more susceptive to rhm than to lhm . 
 figure [ fig3 ] shows the characteristic widths of the lhm and rhm for @xmath65 . 
 it is seen that the lhm confinement is better . 
 .,width=302 ]      when our chain dynamics is expressed in terms of its eigenstates , a significant asymmetric behavior is exposed . 
 this asymmetry stems from the nature of the lhm , rhm , and from the specific way they may couple to each other . 
 let us consider the propagator @xmath92 in eq . 
 ( [ eqas1b ] ) . 
 this symmetric matrix has two distinct eigenvectors @xmath93 for simplicity , we again assume a balanced particle @xmath61 . the system in eq . 
 ( [ eqas1a ] ) can now be _ 
 diagonalized _ by using the transformation matrix @xmath94 . 
 the result is two _ decoupled _ and scalar difference equations    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 and where @xmath98    the two problems @xmath99 and @xmath100 are completely decoupled , each possesses its own dispersion . 
 furthermore , since @xmath101 is the eigenmode associated with @xmath99 , it determines the mode structure for _ both propagation directions_. hence , this mode is rh for propagations towards @xmath102 , and lh for propagation towards @xmath103 . 
 the case of @xmath100 is reversed . 
 in fact , the dispersion for @xmath99 is given by the roots of eq . 
 ( [ eq7 ] ) with the @xmath104 sign , i.e.  it is nothing but @xmath63 _ 
 only_. likewise , the dispersion for @xmath100 is given by the roots of eq . 
 ( [ eq7 ] ) with the @xmath105 sign , hence it is nothing but @xmath64 _ 
 only_. these dispersions are shown in fig .  [ fig4 ]    ) ([eqas3c ] ) . 
 ( a ) @xmath99 yields the @xmath63 curve only , and ( b ) @xmath100 yields the @xmath64 curve only . 
 , width=283 ]    clearly , each mode s dispersion is un - even with respect to the propagation wavenumber @xmath54 . at frequencies corresponding to @xmath106 
 it seems that there is only one - way propagation for each of the modes . 
 nevertheless , the chain itself is reciprocal . 
 this apparent contradiction with the lorentz reciprocity theorem stems from the fact that each of the de - coupled formulations in eqs . 
 ( [ eqas3a])([eqas3c ] ) represent only a part , or a projection , of the chain dynamics , and does not expose the subtleties associated with the problem _ excitation_. this is further discussed in appendix [ app_recip ] . 
 this type of decomposition is useful in determining the response to a general point source @xmath107 . 
 we decompose the source using eq . 
 ( [ eqas3c ] ) , then calculate the response to each of the @xmath108 components independantly . 
 the total response is given by the superposition of these . 
 naturally , if both @xmath109 and @xmath110 are present , we will still obtain an asymmetric response . 
 our analysis can also be applied to the case of unbalanced particles . 
 this would lead to eigenmodes which are not purely rhm or lhm , but rather some mixture of the two . 
 further , this will cause the dispersion of both eigenstates to have lightlines ( a situation that in some sense resembles excitation by a general source , as discussed ) . to elucidate this , we choose a simple model where @xmath111 , which creates not only unequal @xmath112 and @xmath113 , but also a deviation in their resonance frequencies ( @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) . for this case , eq .  ( [ eq6 ] ) can then be written as @xmath116 both branches are shown in fig . 
 [ fig_unbalanced ] 
 . as we see , there is a lightline branch for both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , yet the strong asymmetry is maintained , and all further conclusions still apply , with the proper adjustments to the eigenmodes . 
 the excitation properties of each of the modes discussed in previous sections , as well as of other wave - constituents that may be supported by the chain , are fully exposed by the chain s green s function matrix @xmath117 , defined as the response to a @xmath118-dyad . 
 continuing our interest in the mixed modes , we use the truncated dynamics equation eq . 
 ( [ eqas1a ] ) . under this truncation @xmath117 is a @xmath47 matrix sequence whose first [ second ] column describes the dipole chain response @xmath119 to @xmath120 [ @xmath121 . 
 the response to any incident field @xmath122 is then obviously obtained via the discrete convolution of the latter with @xmath117 . 
 to derive @xmath117 we use the double - sided @xmath123 transform commonly applied to analyze discrete systems and difference equations @xcite , and has been applied also to discrete electromagnetic systems in @xcite . 
 the present study follows essentially the same steps as in @xcite . for convenience , 
 some details are provided in appendix [ app_zt ] . 
 the chain dynamics in eq . 
 ( [ eqas1a ] ) can be presented as the discrete convolution formula    @xmath124    where @xmath125    we apply the @xmath123 transform on the equation above , using the notations @xmath126 and similarly to all other involved quantities . with the convolution theorem eq . 
 ( [ eq13a ] ) reduces to @xmath127^{-1 } { \mbox{\boldmath$ \hat{f}$}}(z).\ ] ] hence @xmath128 is given by the inverse z transform ( izt )    @xmath129    where , @xmath130^{-1}\ ] ]    by applying the zt to eq . 
 ( [ eq13b ] ) we obtain ( see appendix [ app_gz ] ) @xmath131 from eq . 
 ( [ eq5bb ] ) . 
 the inverse of the above yields @xmath132 \end{split}\ ] ] where we have again assumed the use of a balanced particle @xmath61 . while one may always apply the izt on the last expression numerically and obtain the exact green s function , a good physical insight is gained by examining the analytic properties of @xmath133 in the complex @xmath123 plane . 
 each and every singularity represents a distinct wave phenomena , and it s excitation is nothing but the corresponding residue . 
 we note that @xmath50 mainly consist of summation of polylogarithm functions @xmath134 , see eqs . 
 ( [ eqappb_5b])([eqappb_6a ] ) ( appendix [ app_gz ] ) . 
 since @xmath135 and @xmath136 , then @xmath137 @xmath138 inherit the branch point and branch cuts singularities of @xmath139 at @xmath140 , creating riemann sheets of infinite multiplicity . in the principal riemann sheet @xmath141 , @xmath50 and @xmath133 possess two branch points at @xmath142 with one cut that emerges from @xmath143 and extends to infinity , and a second cut that emerges from @xmath144 and extends to the origin . 
 further details regarding the discontinuity across the cuts can be found in @xcite or in the appendix of ref . 
 @xcite .    since the polylogarithm function has no poles and no zeros , the pole singularities of @xmath133 are only due to the zeros of its denominator , namely @xmath145 . 
 due to the specific structure of @xmath50 [ note eq . 
 ( [ eqappb_5e ] ) ] it follows that all the singular points must satisfy _ 
 inversion symmetry_. that is , if @xmath146 is a pole , then @xmath147 must also be a pole . 
 this is quite general , and holds also for the branch points and cuts discussed above  a consequence of the chain s reciprocity . furthermore , the pole equation is in fact a slight generalization of eq . 
 ( [ eq7 ] ) with @xmath148 and @xmath149 ,    @xmath150    associating the pole singularities with the chain modes . 
 there are six roots to this equation , providing six poles . 
 the modes dispersion are the solution of @xmath151    the curves presented in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] correspond to poles that reside exactly on the unit circle in the complex @xmath123 plane and consequently admit real @xmath54 in the equation above , and then the radiation damping in @xmath152 precisely cancels out with @xmath153 . in the general case , however , depending on the values of @xmath152 the poles @xmath154 may reside off the unit circle , yielding _ leaky waves _ 
 ( and also lossy waves , if @xmath152 consists of material loss ) . following the discussion of the izt in appendix [ app_zt ] poles for which @xmath155 represent wave constituents of @xmath128 that contribute to @xmath156 , respectively 
 - see fig . 
 [ fig1app_zt ] and explanation therein . 
 finally , we note that since the guided modes poles in the lossless chain satisfy @xmath157 , their classification as singularities that contribute to @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) encircled by @xmath160 in fig . 
 [ fig1app_zt ] ( encircled by @xmath161 ) can not be done according to their locations inside ( outside ) the unit circle . in this case 
 the classification is done according to the group velocity @xmath162^{-1}$ ] . 
 alternatively one may observe the shift of @xmath154 off the unit circle when loss is added to the system , and classify accordingly .    since there are six poles and they satisfy inversion symmetry , we denote by @xmath163 those that contribute to @xmath158 ( with @xmath164 ) and by @xmath165 those that contribute to @xmath159 . likewise 
 , the branch cut that emerges from @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) and extends to the origin ( to infinity ) contributes to @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) . 
 thus , by applying the residue theorem to eq . 
 ( [ eq16a ] ) for @xmath158 we find    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the result of an integration around the branch point no . 
 2 and the corresponding cut , and @xmath170 is the residue of the @xmath171-th pole . 
 it is given by @xmath172}\,z_{p\ell}^{n-1}\ ] ]    where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to the argument , and where we have used the fact that the poles satisfy eq . 
 ( [ eq19a ] ) . using the corresponding expressions in appendix [ app_gz ] and eq . 
 ( [ eqappb_9 ] ) there we finally find for the pole residues    @xmath173    where @xmath174 is the amplitude @xmath175^{-1 }        \end{split}\ ] ]    recall that for @xmath158 the @xmath63 dispersion represents rh modes , while the @xmath64 represents lh modes . for @xmath159 their roles interchange . 
 as the pole approaches the branch - point @xmath176 we have @xmath177 . 
 this is a manifestation of the fact that the conventional light - line mode is hardly excited as has already been observed in previous studies @xcite . 
 however , it is interesting to note that @xmath178 stays finite in this limit . 
 hence , in contrast to the rh modes , the lh mode is practically excitable when it approaches the light - line . 
 figure [ fig5 ] shows the excitation amplitude ( residues ) of the rh and lh modes . 
 .,width=302 ]      an obvious way to excite the lh mode in the chain is to place a dipole in the chain axis , whose frequency is in the range where the rh mode doesnot possess real @xmath54 . referring to figs [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] 
 , this corresponds to @xmath179 . clearly , the particle s dipole response is negative there . 
 a more interesting case is to work in the domain of positive @xmath152 , but as seen in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] in this domain both lh and rh modes can exist . 
 an insight into the excitation possibilities is provided by eqs . 
 ( [ eq21a])([eq21b ] ) . 
 we emphasize that the upper ( + ) sign and the lower ( - ) sign correspond , respectively , to the rhms and lhms in the @xmath158 domain . for @xmath159 their roles interchange . in light of this fact and in light of the analysis presented in sec . 
 [ sec_as ] , we now examine the modes excitation when a huygens source is placed in the chain . in our context 
 a huygens source is a source composed of mutually orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles , that share the same center , oscillate at the same frequency , and possess the same phase . 
 the two options are summarized in table [ table1 ] . 
 .summary of huygens source excitation properties [ cols=""<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]     the observation summarized in table [ table1 ] is a direct manifestation of the chain s _ left - handedness _ : it provides an _ inversion of the radiation properties of huygens sources _ , including the wave handedness . 
 if losses are present in the particles , of course the guided wave would be attenuated due to dissipation . however , the essential [ a]symmetries are maintained , and can be exploited , in the same manner . 
 this fact is discussed and demonstrated for example in @xcite . 
 finally , we note that by placing a source of type @xmath180 above , in a chain with @xmath181 the rhm is leaky and does not propagate in the chain . 
 then the guided mode excited by the source is only the lhm , and it propagates only into the @xmath159 domain . 
 this case is shown in fig . 
 [ fig6 ] . 
 huygens source . 
 the chain inverts its properties.,width=302 ]      recall the discussion in sec . 
 [ sec_as ] . the diagonalization procedure and the ensuing decoupled formulations in eqs . 
 ( [ eqas3a])([eqas3c ] ) hold also for finite or semi - infinite chains . 
 the only difference is in the summation limits , but not in the diagonalizing transformations . 
 hence , chain termination ( e.g.  semi - infinite chain , extending from @xmath182 to infinity ) does not cause any mode - mixing . for a huygens source of the type @xmath99 [ i.e. 
 @xmath183 located at some @xmath184 , a lhm would propagate towards the chain termination at @xmath182 . 
 when this mode hits the termination , it can only be reflected into a rhm . 
 thus , if the frequency is in the domain @xmath179 , where the rhm is in fact a leaky wave , there would be no guided reflection . 
 figure [ fig7 ] shows the response of a finite chain for a huygens source @xmath180 with @xmath181 . 
 the mode leaks to free space with practically zero reflection into the chain .     with @xmath181 located near the termination of a finite chain . 
 there is no reflection from the chain end.,width=302 ] 
 in this work we have formulated the equations governing the dipolar wave propagation in magneto - dielectric particle chains . 
 the modal properties were extracted . 
 it was shown that these structures can support simultaneously left - handed and right - handed modes ( lhm and rhm , respectively ) , and that the lhm are narrower then their right - handed counterparts . 
 lhm dispersion present no lightline - a consequence of their poor matching to free - space field propagation . 
 modal asymmetry was studied , and the asymmetric excitation of the lhms and rhms by huygens sources was demonstrated . 
 complete excitation theory was developed for the propagating and leaky modes , and an explicit form of the chain green s function was obtained . 
 it has been shown that the modal asymmetry can be exploited to eliminate guided parasitic reflections from the termination of finite or semi - infinite chains , thus enabling the use of these chains as matched leaky - wave antennas . for simplicity of derivations 
 we have assumed throughout the work that the particle is balanced , i.e.  @xmath185 . 
 balanced scalar and bi - anisotropic particles were used previously in a number of publications @xcite , and realization using dielectric material has been suggested in @xcite . 
 the same analysis techniques that are used here , can be applied also to explore the case of non - balanced ( and even bi - anisotropic ) particles . 
 in si units , the dipole moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 possess the physical dimensions of c@xmath186 m and a@xmath187 , respectively ( here c , m , and a denote coulomb , meter , and ampere respectively ) . 
 hence all the entries of the six - element column vector @xmath188 have units of @xmath189 . for an isotropic particle 
 , we denote the scalar @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) as the polarizability in si units representing the electric ( magnetic ) dipole response due to a unit electric ( magnetic ) local field . then the entries in eq . 
 ( [ eq1b ] ) are given by @xmath192 and both possess the dimensions of @xmath193 . 
 finally , we note that @xmath112 and @xmath113 above are the static polarizabilities . 
 the expression in eq . 
 ( [ eq1b ] ) provides the quasi - static approximation where the imaginary additive part accounts for the particles radiation damping . 
 clearly , a time - varying electric dipole generates both @xmath24 and @xmath23 fields . 
 the same holds for a time - varying magnetic dipole . 
 if the particles possess only electric response then @xmath23 can be ignored , as is usually the case in most of the previous studies of particle chains . however , in our case the particles are assumed to possess both electric and magnetic dipole responses , hence it is crucial to take into account both fields for each dipole . towards this end , we use the expressions given e.g. in @xcite and define the @xmath194 dyadic green s function matrix via the relation @xmath195 where @xmath196 are the fields at @xmath79 due to the electric and magnetic dipoles @xmath8 and @xmath9 located at @xmath197 , and where @xmath188 is defined in eq . 
 ( [ eq1a ] ) . 
 generally we have @xmath198 , @xmath199 . 
 since the chain coincides with the @xmath200 axes , we are interested only in the case @xmath201 . then , these @xmath18 dyads can be rewritten as @xmath202 etc ... , with    @xmath203 \frac{e^{ikd{\left| n \right|}}}{{\left| n \right|}d}\ ] ]    where @xmath204 are the matrices @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and where @xmath207    the green s dyad in eq . 
 ( [ eq2 ] ) consists of the four @xmath18 matrices @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .    anticipating the use of floquet s theorem for modal analysis , and further the use of @xmath123-transform to study the excitation properties of the chain 
 , we now look for the matrix summation @xmath212 where , for the application of floquet s theorem one merely substitutes the special case @xmath51 . 
 the @xmath123-transform above can be expressed in terms of the polylogarithm functions @xmath213 @xcite defined as @xmath214 strictly speaking , the sum converges only for @xmath215 , but it can be analytically continued into the entire complex @xmath200 plane by noting that @xmath216 , @xmath135 , and by integrating over the second identity in eq . 
 ( [ eqappb_4 ] ) .

 @xcite .    with the use of @xmath217 
 the @xmath194 matrix @xmath218 can be expressed as    @xmath219    where @xmath220\label{eqappb_5c}\\ \nonumber\\ b(z )    & = & f_1 
 ^ -(kd , z)+if_2 ^ -(kd , z)\label{eqappb_5d}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and where @xmath221\label{eqappb_5e}\ ] ]    some properties of the functions above are worth pointing out . 
 first , we note that on the unit circle in the complex @xmath123 plane , i.e.  for @xmath222 with @xmath223 real ,    @xmath224    where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are the generalized clausen functions , @xmath227    these functions are real and @xmath228-periodic . 
 furthermore , for @xmath229    @xmath230    using these identities , it is straight - forward to show that for @xmath222 with @xmath223 real and @xmath231 ,    @xmath232    we note that the second equality has been pointed out already in @xcite .    finally , we note that the derivatives of @xmath233 with respect to @xmath123 are needed for residue estimation in the chain s green function derivation . 
 we have @xmath234 
 the double - sided @xmath123 transform ( zt ) of a _ bounded _ vector or matrix series , say @xmath235 , is obtained by applying the conventional ( scalar - series ) @xmath123 transform to each of the entries . hence @xmath236 and the transform of a matrix @xmath237 
 is obtained similarly . 
 the series region of convergence ( roc ) is a ring that contains the unit circle @xmath238 . 
 the inverse zt ( izt ) is given by @xmath239 the original integration contour should reside within the roc , and encircle the origin in a counter clockwise direction ; @xmath240 is an appropriate path , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig1app_zt ] . for detailed mathematical discussion 
 the reader is referred e.g.  to @xcite where it is termed as the two - sided transform .    to enhance physical insight , 
 however , we shall replace the original contour with integrations around singularities ( poles and branch cuts ) of the inverse transform kernel . 
 thus , @xmath240 is replaced with @xmath241 . for observation points located at @xmath242 
 the integration contour @xmath243 encircles all the singularities _ within _ @xmath240 in the complex @xmath123 plane in a counter clockwise direction . 
 the contour @xmath244 used for @xmath159 encircles all the singularities _ external _ to @xmath240 in the complex @xmath123 plane in a clock - wise direction . 
 the contours are shown in fig . 
 [ fig1app_zt ] . 
 the contributions of the different singularities may readily be used to discern between various wave species . 
 poles located on ( off ) the unit circle corresponds to propagating ( radiation ) modes whereas branch - points and cuts correspond to continuous spectrum ( cs ) waves . a detailed discussion of the application of the zt to propagation in chains of dielectric particles and the aforementioned association of physical phenomena ( chain waves ) with mathematical singularities can be found in @xcite . 
 , branch points by @xmath245 , and branch cuts by wiggly lines . 
 singularities inside ( outside ) the unit circle contribute to @xmath242 ( @xmath159).,width=264 ] 
 to discuss reciprocity , it is best if we start from the general statement of the reciprocity theorem @xcite @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are the fields generated by electric and magnetic sources @xmath249 and @xmath250 and all vectors are regarded as column vectors . 
 we use the pre - defined unified notations and obtain @xmath251 { \mbox{\boldmath$ f$}}_1=\\ \int_v\left [ { \mbox{\boldmath$ j$}}^t_1,- { \mbox{\boldmath$ j$}}_{m1}^t/\eta\right ] { \mbox{\boldmath$ f$}}_2 \label{eq26}\end{gathered}\ ] ] we would like to examine this relation for the point sources @xmath252 which yields the equation @xmath253{\bf g } ( { \mbox{\boldmath$ r$}}- { \mbox{\boldmath$ r$ } } ' ) \left [ \begin{matrix } { \mbox{\boldmath$ p$}}_1 \\ { \mbox{\boldmath$ m$}}_1 \end{matrix}\right]=\\ \left [ { \mbox{\boldmath$ p$}}_1^t,- { \mbox{\boldmath$ m$}}_1^t\right]{\bf g } ( { \mbox{\boldmath$ r$}}'- { \mbox{\boldmath$ r$ } } ) \left [ \begin{matrix } { \mbox{\boldmath$ p$}}_2 \\ { \mbox{\boldmath$ m$}}_2 \end{matrix}\right]\end{gathered}\ ] ] other then stating the condition for reciprocity ( which can be translated to properties for @xmath254 , for example @xcite , eqs . 
 2.143 - 2.145 ) this states another important fact - when switching the role of a general huygens point dipole from source to observer , one must _ flip _ the direction of the magnetic dipole . 
 this is because the electric current is a vector , whereas the magnetic current is a pseudovector @xcite .

30,"recent experimental work  @xcite in ultracold molecule physics has formed fermionic dipolar molecules of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb in their rovibrational and hyperfine ground state . 
 quantum degenerate dipolar systems have long been sought after because their long - range interactions makes them interesting for quantum computing applications and for understanding ordered phases that can arise from long range effects . 
 these systems are both complicated , but tunable , because the long range , anisotropic dipolar interaction can be manipulated with an external electric field  @xcite , and should give rise to rich physics with variety of different ordered phases of matter  @xcite . 
 the dipolar interaction is attractive if the dipole moments are aligned head to tail , and this can lead to undesirable recombination effects if the molecules have an exothermic reaction possible , as with @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules @xcite . 
 this can be mitigated by confining molecules to a narrow two - dimensional layer , and setting a strong electric field perpendicular to this layer , so that the dipole moments of molecules are aligned with the external field and always align head - to - head and tail - to - tail . in this case , the inter - molecule interactions are always repulsive . 
 note that we assume we can create a single isolated plane of dipoles , so there is no possibility to form superfluid pairing between planes , where the interactions are attractive again  @xcite . 
 we assume the dipolar molecules are loaded onto a single square optical lattice with the molecules fully polarized perpendicular to the plane . 
 since the @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules can be prepared in their lowest hyperfine nuclear spin state , the internal spin degree of freedom is effectively frozen out , and the molecules can be described as spinless fermions . 
 previous studies of spinless fermion models  @xcite mostly focused on short range interactions and used the simplification of going to the limit of large spatial dimensions . 
 these works show a rich phase diagram with charge - density - wave ordering and phase separation . 
 there also has been some work in two dimensions focused on stripe physics  @xcite . 
 more recent work , carried out in the context of ultracold dipolar molecules  @xcite , focused primarily on finding new exotic phases ( liquid crystal , smectic , or nematic ) , often achieved by tuning the direction of the external field with respect to the plane of molecules , but has not elucidated the details of the full phase diagram for the density - wave phases . 
 the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec . 
 [ sec : formalism ] we introduce the model and describe the possible density - wave orderings . 
 [ sec : method ] provides the details of the mean - field - theory formalism and the numerical calculations . 
 the results are presented in sec . 
 [ sec : results ] , and they are further discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : discuss ] , which are followed by the conclusions in sec . 
 [ sec : conclude ] . 
 we describe the rovibrational ground - state dipolar molecules in their lowest hyperfine state with the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermionic dipolar molecule at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the number operator , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude between the adjacent sites , and @xmath9 is the long - range dipole interaction , with @xmath10 the position vector for the site @xmath11 . the lattice spacing is taken to be equal to one . with this model 
 , we have assumed that the hopping occurs only between nearest - neighbor sites , and that the molecules are always in the lowest level of the periodic optical lattice potential ( this second assumption is not always true when the interaction between the molecules is too large ) . 
 we have also assumed that the form for the dipole interaction is valid even when the distance between molecules is only one lattice spacing .    due to the bipartite nature of the square lattice , 
 the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a particle - hole symmetric form and one can restrict to fillings that satisfy @xmath12 . 
 since there is no spin degree of freedom in this model , it can only support molecule density wave spatial order . 
 such order is described by its unit cell  a parallelogram spanned by the two fundamental translation vectors for a given density wave order . 
 the area of the unit cell ( @xmath13 ) gives the number of sites with independent average molecule density which is modulated periodically as the unit cell is tiled across the lattice . 
 the number of the independent order parameters for this density wave is equal to @xmath14 ( the average density , or filling , is not counted as an order parameter , and is fixed in the calculation ) . 
 since there is only a finite number of non - equivalent unit cells of a given area on a square lattice , there is only a finite number of possible density wave orders . 
 we have considered all such orders that have up to four different order parameters ( @xmath15 ) and hence this is a restricted phase diagram restricted to low - period phases only . 
 the corresponding fundamental translation vectors and the unit cells for the twelve candidate phases are shown in fig .  [ 
 tab : clusters ] . 
 m1.6 in m1.6 in    [ cols=""^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     & & 0.1 +    another , less direct way to observe spatial order is time - of - flight measurements that use the expansion of the molecular cloud to infer the initial momentum distribution of the molecules . 
 however , the momentum distribution data do not show prominent differences amongst the different ordered phases , so using this approach to detect the ordering is difficult . 
 the mft results show a diverse phase diagram with a number of distinct density - wave phases . 
 however , the mft is an approximate method , which neglects fluctuations and favors ordered states . 
 this brings to mind the question : _ how many of these density - wave phases are actually present in the exact solution _ ?    in the limit @xmath16 , the hamiltonian essentially describes a lattice gas model and can be solved numerically without approximation using classical monte carlo methods . 
 preliminary results support the existence of the checkerboard ( 2b ) and 4d phases , although strongly suppressed in temperature and filling , compared to the mft result . 
 since the mft neglects fluctuations , it is not surprising that the range of ordered phases is contracted in a more precise calculation . 
 however , some higher - period phases become more prominent in the mft solution for intermediate values of @xmath17 , so their presence can not be entirely ruled out by this @xmath16 study 
 . a more complete study will be the topic of further research . 
 also , the phase separation needs to be reviewed using better approximation techniques . 
 the presence of phase separation is tied to the existence of higher - period phases and the fact that the mft strongly stabilizes these phases at the corresponding commensurate fillings . 
 thus , phase separation is promoted by the mft just like the corresponding ordered phases are . 
 it is possible that including even higher order phases ( beyond 4 order parameters ) in a mft study would replace the phase - separated regions with higher - period ordered phases that are commensurate at the corresponding values of filling , yielding a devil s staircase - like structure . 
 another possible alternative to phase separation is the formation of a wigner crystal like state . 
 the reentrant behavior of the checkerboard phase at @xmath18 in the mft results is very likely an artifact of this method and should be reexamined using more precise techniques . 
 it is notable that the mft results do not favor stripes that are aligned with the lattice ( corresponding to phases 2a , 3a , 4a or 5a ) . 
 we found that these phases are either not stable or they are replaced by other phases with lower free energy . for small @xmath17 , good nesting of the fermi surface appears to be important to lower the energy of the system , while for large @xmath17 , strong repulsive interactions between adjacent sites prevents formation of such striped phases . 
 we also see no evidence for any nematic or smectic `` liquid - crystal '' phases . 
 another important question is , _ which of these density - wave phases can be reached and detected in experiment _ ? 
 the mft results show large entropy per particle when the checkerboard state develops at half filling for large interaction , but unfortunately the entropy is severely overestimated in this study , as shown by preliminary monte - carlo results . 
 the most easily observable features in experiment are the structure factors and the gap in the density of states at the commensurate values of filling . 
 these features are most pronounced for the checkerboard phase . in a trap environment 
 , a large gap at half filling should translate into large spatial regions of checkerboard order if the local density approximation is accurate . 
 of course , it is not clear if phases that are seen in a homogeneous system are stabilized or destabilized by the trap environment . 
 this is another question to be addressed in a future study . 
 we have studied the ordering of ultracold diatomic gases on a two - dimensional square optical lattice . we have formulated a model , based on spinless fermions with long range dipole interactions , and solved it using mean field theory . 
 we have found a number of possible density - wave orders that occur mostly around the corresponding commensurate values of filling and create gaps in the density of states at these values of the filling . 
 the phase separation is also often seen between different ordered phases in the mft results . 
 overall , the checkerboard phase is most stable near half filling and has the highest transition temperature . due to the lack of an energy scale associated with spin exchange , the transition temperatures increase with interaction strength . 
 different density wave phases show characteristic and distinct structure factors . 
 we have discussed the validity of these results and the limitations of the mft method used in this study .

31,"recently the experiments atlas and cms at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern reported on the discovery of a new particle with a mass of about 125  gev  @xcite . 
 although not all of its properties have been determined yet the new particle seems to be in accordance with a higgs boson , maybe the one of the standard model ( sm ) , maybe one corresponding to extensions of the sm . in this paper 
 we consider a supersymmetric extension of the sm and report about next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to the production cross section of the lightest cp even higgs boson in this model . 
 one of the aims is to quantify the size of the supersymmetric corrections . 
 first results in this direction have been reported in ref . 
 we will significantly extend these considerations and furthermore provide details on the calculation . 
 the radiative corrections both for inclusive and exclusive processes are summarized in the reports  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . 
 the numerical results for the sm higgs boson production cross section provided in these papers are based on calculations to the gluon fusion process which have been performed up to next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite for arbitrary values of the top quark and higgs boson mass and to nnlo in refs . 
 @xcite adopting the infinite top quark mass approximation . 
 nnlo results for finite top quark masses have been obtained in ref . 
 @xcite .    within the sm 
 the bottom quark contributions are small and nlo terms  @xcite are sufficient considering the size of the corrections induced by the top quark yukawa coupling . 
 this is different in the case of supersymmetry ( susy ) where the factor @xmath1 is accompanied by @xmath2 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and can thus lead to large contributions to the cross section for the production of the lighter cp even higgs boson . 
 explicit analytical nlo results can be found in refs . 
 @xcite ( see also ref . 
 @xcite for numerical results ) . 
 the contribution from the top quark / top squark sector is available already since a few years . within the effective - theory framework , which constitutes an excellent approximation for higgs boson masses below about 200  gev , 
 the production cross section has first been computed in refs . 
 @xcite and has been confirmed analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite ( see also ref . 
 @xcite ) . in refs . 
 @xcite the squark loop contributions to higgs boson production in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have been computed without assuming any mass hierarchy . 
 the first supersymmetric qcd corrections at nnlo have been computed in ref . 
 @xcite ( see also refs . 
 @xcite for estimates prior to this work ) for a degenerate mass spectrum . in this work 
 these considerations are extended to allow for a wide range of phenomenologically interesting scenarios . 
 the three - loop results for the matching coefficients which are presented in this paper have been confirmed by an independent calculation in ref . 
 note that the calculations in the paper are performed in the framework of the mssm , however , they are in principle not limited to the minimal version and could , e.g. , also be applied to the so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) where an additional singlet higgs field is added as compared to the mssm .    in ref . 
 @xcite all supersymmetric masses have been identified . 
 furthermore , some of the technical difficulties in connection to the interplay of dimensional reduction ( dred ) and supersymmetry have been addressed in this reference . in this context 
 it has been very useful to evaluate the qcd corrections within dred and check that the proper renormalization of the evanescent couplings leads to the known analytical expressions after re - expressing the strong dred coupling by its counterpart in dimensional regularization ( dreg ) . in this paper we build on the developed formalism and evaluate the higgs - gluon coupling for various hierarchies which are of phenomenological relevance . in particular , we provide the counterterms of the evanescent couplings which could be relevant also for other calculations . 
 the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly review the formalism and discuss the subtleties at nlo ( where an exact calculation has been performed ) and nnlo . 
 moreover the quality of the approximations applied at nnlo are tested at the nlo level . 
 we discuss at length the renormalization procedure . 
 numerical results for the higgs - gluon coupling are also presented in this section . 
 afterwards we compute in section  [ sec::num ] predictions for the total higgs boson production cross section and consider different scenarios : @xmath3 which maximizes the prediction of the lighter cp even mssm higgs boson and a scenario where one of the top squarks is light whereas the reminder of the mass spectrum is heavy . 
 our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec::concl ] . 
 the theoretical framework needed for the computation of nnlo corrections to the production of a light cp even higgs boson has already been described in ref .  @xcite . for completeness 
 we repeat the most important issues and formulae . 
 starting point is the effective five - flavour lagrange density @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual qcd part with five massless quarks . 
 @xmath6 denotes the light cp - even higgs boson of the mssm , @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and @xmath11 is the gluonic field strength tensor constructed from fields and couplings already present in @xmath5 . 
 the superscript `` 0 '' denotes bare quantities . 
 note that the renormalization of @xmath12 is of higher order in the electromagnetic coupling constant . in eq . 
 ( [ eq::leff ] ) the operator @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 it contains the coupling of the higgs boson to two , three and four gluons . 
 heavy degrees of freedom only contribute to the coefficient function @xmath15 . in the sm 
 this concerns only the top quark whereas for supersymmetric qcd also squarks and gluinos contribute . 
 sample diagrams contributing to @xmath16 at one , two and three loops originating from the coupling of the higgs boson to top quarks and top squarks . 
 the symbols @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote top quarks , top squarks , gluons , gluinos , higgs bosons and @xmath22 scalars , respectively . ] 
 sample diagrams contributing to @xmath16 at one , two and three loops originating from the coupling of the higgs boson to the squarks corresponding to the light quarks . the symbols @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote light quarks , the corresponding scalar super partners , gluons , gluinos , ghosts , higgs bosons and @xmath22 scalars , respectively . 
 @xmath26 is an auxiliary particle used for the implementation of the four - squark vertex . ]    from the technical point of view @xmath15 is computed from vertex diagrams involving two gluons and a higgs boson . in the practical calculation it is convenient to subdivide the contributing feynman diagrams into two classes . 
 the first one contains all contributions where the external higgs boson couples to a top quark or top squark ( see fig .  [ fig::diags1 ] for sample diagrams ) whereas all diagrams with a coupling of the higgs boson to a super partner of the five lighter quark flavours constitute the second class ( see fig . 
 [ fig::diags2 ] ) . 
 note that the diagrams of the latter class lead to corrections to @xmath15 which are suppressed by @xmath27 whereas the higgs - top - squark coupling generates contributions proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the higgs - higgsino bilinear coupling from the super potential ) . although the relative suppression is formally only @xmath33 all @xmath27 terms are numerically much smaller than the leading contribution . in our calculation 
 we consider all squarks except the top squark to be degenerate and we furthermore assume that the corresponding quarks are massless . 
 thus the squark contributions from the first two families cancel and only the contribution from bottom squarks remains . in the following 
 we nevertheless use the notion `` squark contribution '' for diagrams from fig . 
 [ fig::diags2 ] .    in this paper 
 we compute all contributions from the top quark / top squark and light quark / squark sector in the limit of vanishing light quark masses up to three loops . for the corresponding feynman rules we refer to the appendices of refs . 
 @xcite and  @xcite . 
 note that the couplings to the super partners of the light quarks has been implemented by averaging over the up , down , strange , charm and bottom squark contribution . since for large values of @xmath2 bottom quark diagrams might give large contributions they 
 will be included in our numerical prediction up to nlo  @xcite as we will describe in section  [ sub::form ] .    since @xmath15 constitutes the effective higgs - gluon coupling it is sufficient to evaluate the corresponding feynman integrals in the limit of vanishing external momenta 
 this is conveniently achieved by applying a projector ( see , e.g. , eqs .  ( 11 ) and  ( 12 ) in ref . 
 @xcite ) on one of the two tensor structures and by performing a naive taylor expansion afterwards . as a result one ends up with vacuum integrals involving several mass scales in the case of supersymmetry . 
 up to two - loop order such integrals can be computed exactly , the corresponding algorithm and necessary formulae have been provided in ref .  @xcite almost 20  years ago . 
 since an analogue algorithm at three - loop order is not available to date one has to rely on special cases combined with expansions in order to construct approximations to the exact formulae . 
 a general outline of such an approach has been discussed in ref . 
 @xcite where three - loop corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass have been computed . in this paper 
 we refine the approximation method which is described in subsection  [ sub::appr ] . 
 however , we first discuss in the next subsection the renormalization procedure .      besides the technical difficulties , which are described in subsection  [ sub::appr ] , also several field theoretic challenges have to be solved . 
 they are mainly connected to the fact that for the calculation of @xmath15 it is convenient to use dred  @xcite whereas the calculations within the effective theory of eq . 
 ( [ eq::leff ] ) are performed with the help of dreg . 
 the lo calculation is not affected by this issue . also at nlo 
 it is possible to proceed in a naive way . at nnlo , however , it is necessary to properly renormalize all occurring parameters and to use the relations between their dred and dreg definition . in ref . 
 @xcite the procedure has been described for a degenerate susy spectrum , the modifications necessary to cover the most general case are straightforward and briefly touched in the following . 
 we renormalize all parameters in the @xmath34 scheme except @xmath35 and the coupling of the higgs boson to @xmath22 scalars . 
 @xmath35 is renormalized on - shell with the condition @xmath36 . 
 note that we take this limit only in the final result since in intermediate steps @xmath37 terms occur which have to be canceled by proper counterterms . 
 the two - loop @xmath34 counterterms for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent of all occurring scales and can be found in refs . 
 @xcite ( see also references therein ) . due to the quadratic divergence 
 the renormalization constants for the squark masses and the mixing angle @xmath40 , which we also need up to two loops , depend on mass ratios which is known exactly , even up to three loops  @xcite . 
 the gluino mass counterterm is only needed to one - loop order . 
 as far as wave function renormalization of external particles is concerned only the one for the external gluons contributes . 
 actually , for our calculation only those contributions to the gluon two - point function have to be considered which contain heavy particles . 
 this is conveniently formulated in terms of a bare decoupling constant of the gluon field  @xcite which is usually denoted by @xmath41 . 
 note that in our case @xmath41 has to accomplish both the decoupling of all supersymmetric particles and the top quark and the transition from dred to dreg . for the degenerate 
 mass case results can be found in ref . 
 the analytical expressions needed for the calculations performed in this paper can be found in electronic form in  @xcite . 
 note that @xmath15 is multiplicatively renormalized with @xmath42 . 
 a non - standard part of the renormalization procedure concerns the so - called evanescent couplings which emerge through radiative corrections . in our case 
 there are two operators which define the following lagrange density ( see also discussion in ref .

 @xmath63 is the mixing angle between the weak and the mass eigenstates of the neutral scalar higgs bosons and @xmath2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .    a closer look to eq . 
 ( [ eq::deltalambda ] ) shows that the terms proportional to @xmath64 exactly cancel in the sum of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . 
 thus for a massless top quark there is no need to introduce a counterterm for @xmath67 since the corresponding contributions cancel within one family . 
 note , however , that the @xmath64 terms are needed to obtain separately finite results for the top and light quark sector .    in the supersymmetric limit 
 the appearance of the evanescent coupling @xmath68 is forbidden by supersymmetry and thus there will be no radiative corrections to a vanishing @xmath69 coupling . 
 both @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanish independently . 
 any non vanishing radiative corrections to the @xmath69 coupling is generated by the presence of soft susy breaking terms in the lagrangian . 
 it is interesting to note that without introducing @xmath54 the terms in @xmath16 proportional to @xmath64 are not finite in the limit @xmath72 . 
 rather they behave like @xmath73 at two - loop order and even like @xmath74 at three loops which is due to diagrams like the third one in the third row of fig . 
 [ fig::diags1 ] . 
 the inverse powers in @xmath35 only cancel after the contribution from @xmath54 is added and thus the limit for vanishing @xmath22 scalar mass can be taken in the final expression . 
 the cancellation works independently for the top ( fig .  [ fig::diags1 ] ) and light quark sector ( fig .  [ fig::diags2 ] ) . in eq . 
 ( [ eq::deltalambda ] ) we also list the contributions of order @xmath75 and @xmath76 which , however , do not contribute to the final result . in intermediate steps 
 also @xmath77 terms are present which , however , cancel among the diagrams involving top quark and top squark loops .    from this discussion 
 it becomes clear that the @xmath78 terms could be avoided if a matching to an effective lagrangian defined within dred would be performed . 
 however , in that case it is likely that more operators have to be considered in the effective lagrangian which have not yet been studied in the literature . 
 alternatively the calculations could probably also be performed in the limit where @xmath35 is the largest scale . 
 since the final result has to be independent of @xmath35 one could perform the limit @xmath79 . as a consequence , the inverse powers in @xmath35 drop out by construction and the positive powers have to cancel in the final result , in analogy to the inverse powers in our approach . 
 the next step concerns the transformation of the @xmath34 strong coupling in the full theory ( @xmath80 ) to the @xmath81 version in five - flavour qcd ( @xmath82 ) . 
 this is again achieved with the help of the corresponding decoupling constant defined through @xmath83 results for @xmath84 can again be found in refs . 
 @xcite for the degenerate mass case . 
 exact results can be obtained from the calculations performed in ref . 
 @xcite but also from  @xcite where an explicit result is provided . 
 note that it is important to have at hand the one - loop term of @xmath84 up to order @xmath85 since at this step @xmath15 still contains poles originating from the light degrees of freedom . 
 they are removed with the help of the renormalization constant @xmath86 via @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the five - flavour qcd beta function with @xmath89 and in the second line the perturbative expansion up to two loops is displayed . 
 .[tab::cts]counterterms and decoupling constants entering the three - loop calculation of @xmath16 . [ cols=""^,<,^"",options=""header "" , ]     let us finally present results for @xmath90 which include in addition bottom quark contributions up to nlo and furthermore also electroweak corrections . in fig . 
 [ fig::sig_h_mtil_tb](a ) and  ( b ) the dependence on @xmath91 and @xmath2 is plotted , respectively , where from bottom to top the lo , nlo and nnlo results are shown . 
 we refrain from showing the bottom quark contributions separately since they are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the top contributions . however , the interference terms have a visible effect which can be seen by the difference between the dashed and dotted curves since in the latter the quantities @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eq . 
 ( [ eq::sigma ] ) are set to zero . 
 one observes a reduction of about 5% after including bottom quark effects  basically independent of @xmath94 and @xmath2 . 
 thus even for @xmath95 the bottom quark effects are small for the considered scenarios and hence a nnlo calculation for @xmath96 is not mandatory . 
 the reduction from top / bottom interference is to a large extend compensated by the electroweak corrections taken into account in a multiplicative way ( cf . 
 ( [ eq::sigma ] ) ) as can be seen by solid line which includes all contributions of eq . 
 ( [ eq::sigma ] ) . 
 we have computed the three - loop corrections to the matching coefficient of the effective higgs - gluon coupling @xmath16 originating from supersymmetric qcd . 
 the three - loop integrals contain several mass scales and thus an exact calculation on the basis of the techniques available these days is not possible . 
 we have developed an approximation method based on expansions in mass hierarchies and mass differences which selects the best parametrization for the expansion parameters . 
 the described procedure is not bound to the problem at hand but can certainly also be applied to other processes .    the three - loop result for @xmath16 
 is used in order to evaluate the higgs boson production cross section at lhc to nnlo . whereas the three - loop expressions are only available for vanishing light quark masses we include up to nlo the contributions from the top and bottom sector allowing for a non - vanishing bottom quark mass . 
 numerical results for the total production cross section are presented for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath97  tev for two mssm scenarios which predict a light supersymmetric higgs boson mass in accordance with the recent results from atlas and cms . 
 we study both the dependence on the renormalization scale , @xmath2 and on the @xmath94 , the singlet soft susy breaking mass parameter of the right - handed top squark . for the case where all supersymmetric masses are above 1  tev the supersymmetric corrections are small . 
 however , in case one of the top squarks becomes of the order of a few hundred gev the supersymmetric corrections to the matching coefficient @xmath16 are not negligible any more and a sizeable effect on the production cross section is noticeable . for the scenarios considered in this paper a reduction of the nnlo prediction of the cross section by a few percent 
 is observed . 
 we also want to stress that visible effects result from separating the soft and hard scale in @xmath16 which automatically resums potentially large logarithms involving the higgs boson mass .    in order to perform the numerical evaluation 
 a flexible tool has been developed which allows a convenient handling of the spectrum generators in combination with mathematica and c++ routines evaluating the cross sections . in a comfortable way it is possible to vary the renormalization scale or other parameters entering the prediction .

32,"the existence of closed string - like solutions in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional field theories is certainly one of the intriguing aspects of modern mathematical physics . 
 typically , these localised solutions describe one - dimensional structures which may twist non - trivialy in the forms of loops , links and knots characterised by a hopf index . 
 roughly , a hopf soliton ( or hopfion ) is a knot in a three - dimensional continuous unit vector field which can not be unknotted without cutting @xcite . 
 remarkably , they appear in a variety of physical systems such as bose - einstein condensates @xcite , ferromagnetism @xcite , magnetohydrodynamics @xcite and non - abelian gauge theories , where they are supposed to describe glue - balls @xcite . 
 more recently , it was proposed that liquid crystals also provide an ideal setting for exploring such topological phenomena @xcite . 
 one of the simplest relativistic systems supporting knots is the @xmath2 variant of the skyrme model @xcite . 
 the so called fadeev - niemi ( fn ) model describes the dynamics of a three - dimensional iso - vector @xmath3 taking values on a bi - dimensional sphere @xmath4 
 i.e. @xmath5 @xcite . 
 the lagrangian is that of a sigma model plus fourth order corrections and the topological content appears when we consider static solutions with asymptotic behaviour @xmath6 . in this situation 
 the field realizes the map between spheres @xmath7 which is characterised by the hopf index . 
 interestingly , the fn model appears quite naturally in the dual superconducting ( ds ) picture of the strongly coupled su(2 ) yang - mills theory discussed in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite . 
 accordingly , the high energy limit of the theory describes asymptotically free , massless point - like gluons and the infrared limit describes extended flux tubes which close on themselves in stable knotted configurations . 
 this scenario is particularly compelling because it is consistent with the accepted notion of color confinement in qcd and therefore can shed some light into the mass gap problem . 
 unfortunately , the equations are highly nonlinear and most of the results rely on numerical lattices approaches and/or approximations @xcite-@xcite .    although important results on the global existence and development of singularities have been obtained for semi - linear wave maps ( see , for instance , @xcite -@xcite and references therein ) much less is known about the evolutionary properties of the fn equations . 
 generically , one expects that not all initial data will be mathematically admissible since for a large class of them the cauchy problem would be ill - posed . 
 indeed , it is quite common that quasi - linear pde s generate systems which are not of evolutionary type ( for some data ) even if the theory is lorentz invariant by construction ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . needless to say , this lack of hiperbolicity may be of crucial importance in numerical simulations where imprecisions in the initial data may originate instabilities , singularities and discontinuous solutions . 
 in this letter we investigate the causal structure of the fn model and clarify some aspects related to its propagation features . 
 we show that the high frequency excitations on top of background solutions are described by characteristic surfaces governed by a curved effective geometry ( see @xcite for a review ) . 
 this is related to the fact that for quasi - linear equations wave velocities are not given a priori , but change as functions of initial data , directions of propagation and wave polarisation . with respect to the new geometry , 
 rays are equivalent to null geodesics , and therefore can be described using traditional tools of general relativity ( see @xcite for a similar analysis in the context of hydrodynamics ) . in particular , we show that the causal replacement inherits the hopf charge of the soliton . in this sense , 
 the present work is a natural generalisation of previous results sketched by gibbons and the author in @xcite . 
 formally , the fn model is a lorentz invariant lagrangian theory of maps into a surface @xcite . 
 it can be implemented in terms of a continuous and surjective map @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the riemannian metric on the unit 2-sphere . 
 the map induces the pull - back spacetime tensors @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 with @xmath14 the area 2-form on the sphere . 
 following @xcite we call the tensor @xmath15 the strain for the map @xmath16 
 . the antisymmetric object @xmath17 and the strain satisfy the algebraic relation @xmath18    typically , one is interested in particular mappings with the asymptotic behaviour @xmath19 , which means that the state of the fields are homogeneous as they approach spatial infinity . as usual , we choose this constant such that the field state corresponds to the north pole @xmath20 on the target . under this boundary condition , @xmath21 effectively maps @xmath22 in @xmath4 for a given time coordinate @xmath23 and therefore there is a homotopy invariant @xmath24 . 
 roughly , it will remain the same under any smooth deformation of the map . 
 according to the above construction @xmath17 is globally exact i.e. @xmath25 thus , @xmath26 such that @xmath27}$ ] everywhere . also , if we define the dual @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the usual levi - civita tensor it follows that @xmath30 identically . 
 in particular we have @xmath31 and it results a conserved current of the form @xmath32 . 
 whitehead first showed @xcite that it is possible to express the hopf invariant as an integral of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 a normalised timelike vector ( @xmath35 ) orthogonal to the space slices . 
 interestingly , the pre - image @xmath36 of a given point @xmath37 is an integral line of the divergenceless magnetic - like vector field in @xmath38 given by @xmath39 as is well known , @xmath40 can be interpreted heuristically as the linking number between two such  magnetic "" field lines , ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) . 
 generically , these field lines will twist among themselves in a highly nontrivial way for large values of the index , filling the space with a complex fibered structure ( see fig.1 ) . 
 in particular , the pre - image of the south pole @xmath43 is defined as the position of the hopf soliton as it corresponds to the position in @xmath44 more distant to the vacuum .     for @xmath45 , respectively . 
 the closed curves representing the boundaries of the ( seifert ) surfaces correspond to the pre - images @xmath41 and @xmath42 of two points @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath44 . ] 
 the pulled - back tensors @xmath48 and @xmath17 give rise to invariants from which we can naturally define an action for the map . 
 in the model proposed by fadeev and niemi the action is given by @xmath49=\int \ \frac{1}{2}l^{a}_{\phantom a a}-\frac{\kappa^{2}}{4}f_{ab}f^{ab } \ d^{4}x,\ ] ] where , as usually , the second term is introduced in order to guarantee the stability of solitons against scalings and @xmath50 is a parameter controlling the strength of nonlinearities . 
 we note that this term resembles the lagrangian of maxwell s electrodynamics directed along the fibers @xcite . ] . 
 variation with respect to @xmath51 yields a system of second order quasi - linear pde s which can be written in the compact form @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 represents the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath56 . ) 
 can be written also in the form @xmath57_{||c}\partial_{a}\phi^{c}=0 $ ] ] in terms of the target connection @xmath58 , eq . ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 which reveals that the equation of motion consists of various types of self - interactions arising from the non - standard kinetic terms and the target space geometry . 
 generically , it is possible to express eq . 
 ( [ bse ] ) as @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for semilinear terms in @xmath51 ( lower order derivatives ) and the principal symbol is given by @xmath62    as it is well known , the highest - order terms in derivatives almost completely controls the qualitative behaviour of solutions of a partial differential equation . 
 we note that @xmath63 is automatically symmetric with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath65 . also , in the absence of the skyrme term eq . 
 ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to the semilinear equation known as the classical @xmath2 sigma - model . 
 in what follows we will see that the energy momentum tensor plays a crucial role in the description of the propagation cones . here 
 , @xmath66 can be split in two parts @xmath67\kappa^2.\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that @xmath68 has exactly the same form as the energy momentum - tensor in electrodynamics . 
 in particular , it is traceless , which implies the well known equation of state @xmath69 between the corresponding energy and pressure . in @xcite 
 it was showed by gibbons that the energy momentum tensor of the @xmath70 skyrme model satisfies the dominant energy condition . 
 this was achieved using the eigenvalue decomposition introduced by manton in @xcite . here , we see that this property still holds because the content of the lagrangian is the same . 
 the nonlinear structure of the field equations implies that linearised waves interact with background solutions in a nontrivial way . 
 the characteritic surfaces of the model can be obtained by means of the eikonal approximation . 
 formally , we consider a one - parameter family of solutions of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a smooth solution and let the real parameter @xmath73 . in this limit 
 , we can discard all semilinear contributions in ( [ l ] ) and consider only the principal part term contributions .    defining the wave covector @xmath74 , the equation of motion reduces to the eigenvalue equation @xmath75\varphi^{b}=0,\ ] ] where we defined the symmetric matrix @xmath76 . 
 it follows that ( [ eigenvalue ] ) can be solved only if @xmath77 satisfy the algebraic conditions @xmath78 as a consequence , at a given spacetime point , the wave normals are characterised by the roots of a multivariate polynomial of fourth order in @xmath77 in the cotangent space @xmath79 . 
 the resulting algebraic variety changes from point to point in a way completely prescribed by the background solution @xmath80 and the nonlinearities of the model . 
 the general form of @xmath81 is given by a quartic polynomial which factorizes . 
 in other words the characteristic polynomial reduces to a product of two simpler quadratic terms satisfying @xmath82[(h^{-1})^{cd}k_{c}k_{d}]=0.\ ] ] surprisingly , the reciprocal quadratic form @xmath83 can be written in terms of the total energy momentum tensor of the background field @xmath84 where @xmath85 is nothing but the lagrangian of the model and @xmath86 . as a consequence , 
 the vanishing sets of ( [ z ] ) constitute the fn analogues of the fresnel equation encountered in optics . 
 they play the role of a fourth order space - time dispersion relation ( at least up to a conformal factor ) . in general 
 , @xmath87 will solve one quadratic polynomial or the other , although it is possible that there exist some directions where the vanishing sets coincide . 
 consequently , the model admits two different types of waves . 
 one wave travels with the velocity of light while the other travels with a velocity wich depends implicitly on the solution and on the hopf charge . 
 more explicitly , we have @xmath88 which reveals that both pulled - back tensors contribute to the causal structure . 
 note that if @xmath50 is set to zero the fn model reduces to the usual @xmath2 sigma model ( wave map equation ) implying that the effective metric becomes flat everywhere . 
 now , if the quantity @xmath83 is non - degenerate it is possible to define its inverse @xmath89 such that @xmath90 . in general , the _ effective metric _ 
 @xmath89 defines a lorentzian metric on spacetime , the null cones of which are the effective  sound cones "" of the theory . 
 the ray vectors @xmath91 associated to the wave fronts are the vanishing sets of the dual polynomial @xmath92 @xmath93[h_{ab}q^{a}q^{b}]=0\ ] ] as is well known , these cones completely determine the causal structure of the theory once a solution is given . 
 in particular , nontrivial excitations propagate along geodesics of the effective spacetime . 
 in fact , we obtain ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath94 where ; is such that @xmath95 . 
 note that for an arbitrary solution @xmath96 endowed with invariant @xmath40 the quadratic form @xmath97 is generally curved , implying that we can use appropriate geometrical methods to describe the causal structure . 
 we now discuss some general properties of the effective metric . for the sake of simplicity , 
 let us suppose that the solution @xmath80 describes a static hopf soliton with a given topological invariant @xmath40 . 
 time - dependent configurations may be easily obtained using the same framework . in the static regime eq . 
 ( [ quantity ] ) reduces to @xmath98 with @xmath99 the position vector in @xmath38 and @xmath100 . 
 because the field tends to its vacuum in spatial infinity i.e. @xmath101 , we automatically have @xmath102 which means that the effective geometry is static and asymptotically flat for all possible static solitons . 
 this is an expected result since the solitons are supposed to be localised field structures in space with finite energy . 
 we now ask the following : locally , how does a wave propagate in the direction of @xmath103 ? 
 in other words , what is the velocity of a disturbance which evolves in the direction defined by a pre - image curve at a spacetime point @xmath104 ? in order to find this velocity , first note that the vector @xmath103 is automatically an eigenvector of the linear operator @xmath105 with a null eigenvalue . 
 indeed , in the static regime we have @xmath106 meaning that the kernel of @xmath105 is determined by a timelike vector @xmath107 and the 
 magnetic "" field itself . a direct inspection in eq . ( [ double ] ) 
 implies that the projection @xmath108 also vanishes . 
 now , the wave front is determined by a covector @xmath109 of the form @xmath110 with ( r , s ) real components . using the above results in eq . 
 ( [ quantity ] ) it follows directly @xmath111 thus , the vector field @xmath103 defines special directions where the effective cone coincides with the minkowski cone . in other words , 
 the pre - images of the map @xmath51 in @xmath1 define directions where the effective causal structure is not affected by the solution . 
 note however that , because the pre - image curves are linked in a nontrivial way , the resulting light cones in the global may have a very complicated structure .    . 
 the round sphere represents velocities of propagation according with the minkowski metric . 
 note that they intersect in the direction of @xmath103 . ] 
 what about wave propagation in other directions ? 
 following manton @xcite we suppose that @xmath48 can be diagonalised relative to @xmath112 in a given spacetime point @xmath104 . 
 as is well known the eigenvalues are necessarily nonnegative and due to rank considerations two of them vanish identically . choosing the spatial axis in such a way that @xmath113 it follows @xmath114 in particular , we have @xmath115 . using eq . 
 ( [ eigenv ] ) in eq . 
 ( [ quantity ] ) it results an automatically diagonal @xmath83 @xmath116 two important results emerge : i ) the effective metric has a lorentzian signature @xmath117 for all possible static solitons . 
 are sufficiently regular everywhere . ] 
 this means that the linearisation of the equations of motion ( [ bse ] ) on top of a static solution yields a well defined causal structure . 
 ii ) wave propagation is always sub - luminal , implying that the theory is causal . in particular , 
 velocities of propagation orthogonal to the pre - image curve are of the form @xmath118 with @xmath119 . 
 note that they tend to @xmath120 in spatial infinity . 
 the  sound "" cones of the theory may be obtained also in terms of the null intervals @xmath121 it follows that , locally , the cross - sections of the effective cone in the tangent space are described by ellipsoids with major - axis oriented in the directions defined by @xmath103 . 
 this result is valid for all possible pre - images @xmath122 for all possible charges . 
 see fig.2 for an illustration . 
 again , we stress that because links between pre - images are nontrivial and eigenvalues are space - dependent quantities there will be a highly complex causal structure associated . 
 it remains the possibility that linked or knotted congruences of rays emerge in @xmath38 with regions where waves are trapped . 
 in this section we use the rational map _ ansatz _ introduced by suttcliffe in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in order to explore approximate expressions for @xmath83 . 
 the idea is to achieve a qualitative picture of the metrics without appealing to complicated numerical simulations . 
 the strategy is as follows . 
 recall that the assumption @xmath123 effectively compactifies @xmath1 to the hypersphere @xmath22 . a point of @xmath22 can be thought also as a point of the plane of complex dimension 2 with coordinates @xmath124 and @xmath125 . 
 project the point @xmath124 onto @xmath38 using the map @xmath126 where @xmath127 are cartesian coordinates , @xmath128 and @xmath129 is a monotonically decreasing function such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 . interpret @xmath4 as a riemann sphere introducing a complex coordinate @xmath132 . 
 the idea is to start with spherical coordinates @xmath133 and metric @xmath134 . 
 then , perform a stereographic projection from the south pole @xmath43 ( @xmath135 ) to the equatorial plane to obtain @xmath136 with the absolute value given by @xmath137 . 
 finally , write @xmath132 as a rational function of the complex quantities @xmath138 and @xmath139 in the form @xmath140 where @xmath104 and @xmath141 are polynomials .    as a consequence , for each point @xmath142 
 , we obtain a closed curve @xmath143 in @xmath1 , whose image by @xmath51 is the point @xmath132 . ] . 
 the tangent vectors to these curves define precisely the direction of @xmath103 . 
 in particular , we can obtain the whole of the @xmath38 as  fibers "" over the ordinary 2-sphere . 
 incidentally , for any two points , @xmath144 and @xmath145 on @xmath44 , the corresponding  fibers "" are nontrivialy linked . 
 the number of links depends crucially on the degree of the polynomials @xmath146 and @xmath147 . 
 the interesting point here is that once @xmath104 and @xmath141 are given as functions of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the effective metric may be easily obtained . 
 this can be accomplished writing the pull - back quantities @xmath48 and @xmath17 in terms of the derivatives of @xmath132 . 
 we obtain @xmath148}\overline{w}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath149 and @xmath150=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath151 the complex conjugate}\phi \end{aligned}\ ] ] ] . 
 basically , there will be three different classes of effective geometries . 
 they follow naturally from the classification presented in @xcite for all possible background fields . 
 roughly , they describe the causal structures associated to :    1 . 
 toroidal fields @xmath152 : @xmath153 , with @xmath154 and n = n.m ; 2 .    ( a , b)-torus knots @xmath155 : @xmath156 , with @xmath157 a positive integer , @xmath158 a non - negative integer and a , b co - prime positive integers with @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; 3 . 
 linked hopfions @xmath161 : @xmath162 with @xmath157 a positive integer , @xmath158 a non - negative integer @xmath163 not co - prime ;    as a consequence of the above _ ansatz _ , one is now able to speak about effective geometries engendered by knotted structures . 
 each geometry carries implicitly a hopf charge with it and is somehow related to the homotopy class of the configuration . 
 waves are described by pencils of null geodesics scattered by the corresponding geometry and it is possible that they remain trapped for some regions of the effective spacetime . in order to understand better these aspects 
 , it would be interesting to analyse in more details the geometrical and topological properties of the above metrics , including their symmetries ( see @xcite for a bianchi classification in the helical phase of chiral nematic liquid crystals ) . in particular , one could investigate the approximate behaviour of geodesics arriving from a vacuum domain which is scattered by the solitonic structure . 
 we shall come back to these questions in the future .      as a final remark , lets us illustrate the qualitative behaviour of the pre - images in @xmath38 for the @xmath164 hopfion . as we discussed above 
 they define directions where the waves  perceive "" the actual minkowski spacetime . in other words , 
 metrical relations are only distorted for intervals having some component orthogonal to @xmath103 .    in this case 
 the rational map is simply @xmath165 . for the sake of simplicity 
 we choose a profile function with an exponential decay of the form @xmath166 . 
 we can now calculate the absolute value ( r ) and the argument ( @xmath167 ) as explicit functions of the coordinates @xmath127 . 
 now , instead of only considering pre - images of points , we will consider pre - images of whole sets on @xmath4 . 
 in particular , we consider the pre - images of the paralels @xmath168 and the meridians @xmath169 . 
 they characterise two families of surfaces in @xmath38 . 
 surfaces with constant @xmath170 are homeomorphic to tori . 
 the tori are nested , and their size increase as @xmath170 decreases . in particular , one obtains a one - dimensional curve in the limit @xmath171 . 
 this curve is precisely the position of the hopfion . 
 surfaces with constant @xmath167 are not so simple . 
 they are homeomorphic to parabolic dupin cyclides , i.e. a specific inversion of the torus . 
 the points where a parallel intersects a meridian in @xmath44 are given by the intersections of @xmath172 and @xmath173 in @xmath38 . 
 they are closed curves pairwise linked . 
 we can see such a general behaviour in ( fig . 
 3 ) . the figure shows the intersection between the meridian @xmath174 and a parallel @xmath175 . 
 now , if we consider the collection of all points lying in @xmath44 we obtain the congruence of  magnetic "" field lines filling the entire space ( see fig . 
 4 ) . they can be thought as a continuous deformation of the usual hopf fibration @xcite . roughly , effective metrical relations are the same in the directions of the fibres while they are distorted in any other direction , leading to a nontrivial causal structure in the global .

33,"formal concept analysis ( fca )  @xcite has found many applications since its introduction . as the size of datasets grows , such as data generated from high - throughput technologies in bioinformatics , 
 there is a need for efficient algorithms for constructing concept lattices . 
 the input of fca consists of a triple @xmath0 , called _ context _ , where @xmath1 is a set of objects , @xmath2 is a set of attributes , and @xmath3 is a binary relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in fca , the context is structured into a set of _ concepts_. the set of all concepts , when ordered by set - inclusion , satisfies the properties of a _ 
 complete lattice_. the lattice of all concepts is called _ concept _  @xcite or _ galois _  @xcite lattice . 
 when the binary relation is represented as a bipartite graph , each concept corresponds to a maximal bipartite clique ( or maximal biclique ) . 
 there is also a one - one correspondence of a closed itemset @xcite studied in data mining and a concept in fca . 
 the one - one correspondence of all these terminologies  concepts in fca , maximal bipartite cliques in theoretical computer science ( tcs ) , and closed itemsets in data mining ( dm )  was known , e.g. @xcite . 
 there is extensive work of the related problems in these three communities , e.g. @xcite@xcite in tcs , @xcite@xcite in fca , and @xcite@xcite in dm . 
 in general , in tcs , the research focuses on efficiently enumerating all maximal bipartite cliques ( of a bipartite graph ) ; in fca , one is interested in the lattice structure of all concepts ; in dm , one is often interested in computing frequent closed itemsets only . 
 [ [ time - complexity . ] ] time complexity . 
 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    given a bipartite graph , it is not difficult to see that there can be exponentially many maximal bipartite cliques . for problems with potentially exponential ( in the size of the input ) size output , in their seminal paper  @xcite , 
 johnson  et  al introduced several notions of _ polynomial time _ for algorithms for these problems : _ polynomial total time _ 
 , _ incremental polynomial time _ 
 , _ polynomial delay time_. an algorithm runs in polynomial total time if the time is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input and the size of the output . 
 an algorithm runs in incremental polynomial time if the time required to generate a successive output is bounded by the size of input and the size of output generated thus far . 
 an algorithm runs in polynomial delay time if the generation of each output is only polynomial in the size of input . 
 it is not difficult to see that polynomial delay is stronger than incremental polynomial ( namely an algorithm with polynomial delay time is also running in incremental polynomial ) , which is stronger than polynomial total time . 
 polynomial delay algorithm , we can further distinguish if the space used is polynomial or exponential in the input size . 
 [ [ previous - work . ] ] previous work . 
 + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    observe that the maximal bipartite clique ( mbc ) problem is a special case of the maximal clique problem in a general graph . 
 namely , given a bipartite graph @xmath4 , a maximal bipartite clique corresponds to a maximal clique in @xmath5 where @xmath6 . 
 consequently , any algorithm for enumerating all maximal cliques in a general graph , e.g. , @xcite , also solves the mbc problem . 
 in fact , the best known algorithm in enumerating all maximal bipartite cliques , which was proposed by makino and uno  @xcite that takes @xmath7 polynomial delay time where @xmath8 is the maximum degree of @xmath9 , was based on this approach . 
 the fact that the set of maximal bipartite cliques constitutes a lattice was not observed in the paper and thus the property was not utilized for the enumeration algorithm .    in fca , 
 much of research has been devoted to study the properties of the lattice structure . 
 there are several algorithms , e.g. @xcite , that construct the lattice , i.e. computing all concepts together with its lattice order . 
 there are also some algorithms that compute only concepts , e.g. @xcite . 
 ( we remark that the idea of using a total _ lectical order _ on concepts ganter s algorithm  @xcite is also used in @xcite for enumerating maximal ( bi)cliques . ) 
 see @xcite for a comparison studies of these algorithms . 
 the best polynomial total time algorithm was by nourine and raynaud @xcite with @xmath10 time and @xmath11 space , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the set of all concepts . 
 this algorithm can be easily modified to run in @xmath15 incremental time @xcite . 
 observe that the space of total size of all concepts is needed if one is to keep the entire structure explicitly . 
 there were several other algorithms , e.g.@xcite , all run in @xmath16 polynomial delay . 
 there is another algorithm  @xcite that is based on divide - and - conquer approach , but the analytical running time of the algorithm is unknown as it is difficult to analyze . 
 there are several algorithms in data mining for computing frequent closed itemsets , such as charm(-l ) @xcite , and closet(+ )  @xcite . 
 to our best knowledge , the algorithm with theoretical analysis running time was given in @xcite with @xmath17 incremental polynomial running time , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . 
 [ [ our - results . ] ] our results . 
 + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper , by making use of the lattice structure of concepts , we present a simple and fast algorithm for computing all concepts together with its lattice order . 
 the main idea of the algorithm is that given a concept , when all of its successors are considered together ( i.e. in a batch manner ) , they can be efficiently computed . 
 we compute concepts in the breadth first search ( bfs ) order  the ordering given by bfs traversal of the lattice . 
 when computing the concepts in this way , not only do we compute all concepts but also we identify all successors of each concept . 
 another idea of the algorithm is that we make use of the concepts generated to dynamically update the adjacency relations . 
 the running time of our algorithm is @xmath18 polynomial delay for each concept @xmath19 ( see section  [ sec : background ] for related background and terminology ) , where @xmath20 is the reduced adjacency list of @xmath21 . 
 our algorithm is faster than the best known algorithms for constructing a lattice because the algorithm is faster than a basic algorithm that runs in @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is number of attributes adjacent to the object @xmath21 , and this basic algorithm is already as fast as the current best algorithms for the problem . 
 we also present two variants of the algorithm : one is computing all concepts only and another is constructing the frequent closed itemset lattice . 
 both algorithms are faster than the current start - of - the - art program for these problems . 
 [ [ outline . ] ] outline . 
 + + + + + + + +    the paper is organized as follows . in section 
 [ sec : background ] , we review some background and notation on fca . in section  [ sec : 
 basic ] , we describe some basic properties of concepts that we use in our lattice - construction algorithm . in section  [ sec : 
 algorithms ] , we first describe the high level idea of our algorithm . then we describe how to efficiently implement the algorithm . in section  [ sec : variants ] , we describe two variants of the algorithm . 
 one is for computing all concepts only and another is for constructing a frequent closed itemset lattice . 
 we conclude with discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] . 
 in fca , a triple @xmath24 is called a _ context _ , where @xmath25 is a set of @xmath26 elements , called _ objects _ ; @xmath27 is a set of @xmath28 elements , called _ attributes _ ; and @xmath29 is a binary relation . 
 the context is often represented by a _ 
 cross - table _ as shown in figure  [ table1 ] . 
 a set @xmath30 is called an _ 
 object set _ , and a set @xmath31 is called an _ attribute set_. following the convention , we write an object set @xmath32 as @xmath33 , and an attribute set @xmath34 as @xmath35 .    for @xmath36 , 
 denote the adjacency list of @xmath37 by @xmath38 . 
 similarly , for @xmath39 , denote the adjacency list of @xmath40 by @xmath41 . 
 the function @xmath42 maps a set of objects to their common attributes : @xmath43 , for @xmath30 . 
 the function @xmath44 maps a set of attributes to their common objects : @xmath45 , for @xmath31 . 
 it is easy to check that for @xmath30 , @xmath46 , and for @xmath31 , @xmath47 . 
 an object set @xmath30 is _ closed _ if @xmath48 . 
 an attribute set @xmath31 is closed if @xmath49 . 
 the composition of @xmath50 and @xmath51 induces a _ galois connection _ between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . 
 readers are referred to @xcite for properties of the galois connection .    a pair @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , 
 is called a _ concept _ if @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    for a concept @xmath54 , by definition , 
 both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are closed . 
 the object set @xmath59 is called the _ extent _ of @xmath19 , written as @xmath61 , and the attribute set @xmath60 is called the _ intent _ of @xmath19 , and written as @xmath62 . 
 the set of all concepts of the context @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath63 or simply @xmath14 when the context is understood . 
 let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be two concepts in @xmath14 . 
 observe that if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 
 . we order the concepts in @xmath14 by the following relation @xmath68 : @xmath69 it is not difficult to see that the relation @xmath68 is a partial order on @xmath14 . 
 in fact , @xmath70 is a complete lattice and it is known as the _ concept _ or _ galois _ lattice of the context @xmath0 . for @xmath71 with @xmath72 , if for all @xmath73 such that @xmath74 implies that @xmath75 or @xmath76 , then @xmath19 is called the _ successor_(or _ lower neighbor _ ) of @xmath77 , and @xmath77 is called the _ predecessor _ ( or _ upper neighbor _ ) of @xmath19 . 
 the diagram representing an ordered set ( where only successors / predecessors are connected by edges ) is called a _ hasse diagram _ ( or a line diagram ) . 
 see figure  [ table1 ] for an example of the line diagram of a galois lattice .    for a concept @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 thus , @xmath19 is uniquely determined by either its extent , @xmath81 , or by its intent , @xmath82 . 
 we denote the concepts restricted to the objects @xmath1 by @xmath83 , and the attributes @xmath2 by @xmath84 for @xmath85 , the corresponding concept is @xmath86 . for @xmath87 , 
 the corresponding concept is @xmath88 . 
 the order @xmath68 is completely determined by the inclusion order on @xmath52 or equivalently by the reverse inclusion order on @xmath53 . 
 that is , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are order - isomorphic . 
 we have the property that @xmath91 is a successor of @xmath92 in @xmath93 if and only if @xmath94 is a successor of @xmath95 in @xmath96 . 
 since the set of all concepts is finite , the lattice order relation is completely determined by the covering ( successor / predecessor ) relation . 
 thus , to construct the lattice , it is sufficient to compute all concepts and identify all successors of each concept . 
 in this section , we describe some basic properties of the concepts on which our lattice construction algorithms are based . 
 [ prop-1 ] let @xmath19 be a concept in @xmath63 . 
 for @xmath97 , if @xmath98 is not empty , @xmath99 is closed . 
 consequently , @xmath100 is a concept .    for @xmath97 , 
 suppose that @xmath98 is not empty . 
 we will show that @xmath101 . 
 since @xmath102 , it remains to show that @xmath103 . by definition , @xmath104 . 
 thus , @xmath105 . 
 consequently , @xmath106 . 
 [ cols=""^,^,^ "" , ]     * example . * 
 consider the concept @xmath107 of context in figure  [ table1 ] , we have @xmath108 . 
 for a closed attribute set @xmath109 , denote the set of remaining attributes @xmath110 by @xmath111 . 
 consider the following equivalence relation @xmath112 on @xmath111 : @xmath113 , for @xmath114 . 
 let @xmath115 be the equivalence classes induced by @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath116 , and @xmath117 for any @xmath118 , @xmath119 . 
 we denote the set @xmath120 by @xmath121 . 
 we call @xmath122 the sibling of @xmath123 for @xmath124 . for convenience 
 , we will write @xmath125 by @xmath126 . when there is no confusion , we abuse the notation by writing @xmath127 . 
 note that by definition , @xmath128 for some @xmath129 . 
 we denote the pairs @xmath130 by @xmath131 . 
 recall that @xmath89 and @xmath132 are order - isomorphic . 
 we have the property that @xmath133 is a successor of @xmath92 in @xmath93 if and only if @xmath134 is a successor of @xmath95 in @xmath96 . for each @xmath135 , we call @xmath136 a child of @xmath95 and @xmath95 a parent of @xmath136 . by the definition of the equivalence class , for each @xmath94 that is a successor of @xmath95 , there exists a @xmath137 
 such that @xmath138 . 
 that is , if @xmath94 is a successor of @xmath95 , @xmath94 is a child of @xmath95 . 
 let @xmath139 denote all the successors of @xmath95 , then we have @xmath140 . however , not every child of @xmath95 is a successor of @xmath95 . for the example in figure 
 [ table1 ] , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are successors of @xmath144 but @xmath145 is not . @xmath146 ; while @xmath147 , @xmath148 . 
 similarly , if @xmath149 is a predecessor of @xmath95 , then p is parent of @xmath95 but it is not necessary that every parent of @xmath95 is a predecessor of @xmath95 .    note that for @xmath150 , if @xmath151 , then by definition @xmath136 is closed . 
 it is easy to check that the converse is also true . 
 namely , if @xmath136 is closed , then @xmath151 . in other words 
 , we have the following proposition . 
 [ succ - prop ] @xmath152 is closed , @xmath153 .      by definition , an attribute set @xmath95 is closed if @xmath154 . in the following we give 
 two characterizations for an attribute set being closed based on its relationship with its siblings . 
 [ close - prop ] for @xmath150 , @xmath136 is not closed if and only if there exists @xmath155 , @xmath156 , such that @xmath157 . 
 furthermore , for all @xmath155 with @xmath157 , there exists @xmath158 such that @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 . 
 if @xmath136 is not closed , by definition , there exists @xmath162 such that @xmath163 . as @xmath121 is a partition of @xmath111 , 
 there exists a @xmath164 such that @xmath165 , and thus @xmath166 . 
 conversely , suppose there exists @xmath164 such that @xmath167 
 . then @xmath168 . that is 
 , @xmath169 , which implies @xmath136 is not closed . 
 suppose that @xmath157 with @xmath164 . 
 for @xmath170 , @xmath171 . 
 thus , there exists @xmath158 such that @xmath159 , @xmath160 . since @xmath172 are disjoint , @xmath173 . 
 based on the first part of this proposition ( first characterization ) , we can test if @xmath136 is closed , for @xmath150 , by using 
 _ subset testing _ of its object set against its siblings object set . 
 namely , @xmath136 is closed if and only @xmath174 is not a proper subset of its siblings object set . in our running example in figure  [ table1 ] , @xmath145 
 is not closed because its object set @xmath175 is a proper subset of the object set of its sibling , @xmath176 .    in general , 
 subset testing operations are expensive . 
 we , however , can make use of the second part of the proposition ( second characterization ) for testing closure using set exact matching operations instead of subset testing operations . 
 this is because if we process the children in the decreasing order of their object - set size , we can test the closure of @xmath136 by comparing its size against the size of the attribute set ( if exists ) of @xmath174 . 
 namely , we first search if @xmath174 exists by a set exact matching operation . 
 if it does not , then @xmath136 is closed . 
 otherwise , if the size of the existing attribute set of @xmath174 is greater than @xmath177 , then @xmath136 is not closed . in our running example , @xmath145 is not closed because @xmath178 has a larger attribute set @xmath179 . 
 in this section , we first describe the algorithm in general terms , independent of the implementation details . 
 we then show how the algorithm can be implemented efficiently . 
 recall that constructing a concept lattice includes generating all concepts and identifying each concept s successors . 
 our algorithm starts with the top concept @xmath180 . 
 we process the concept by computing all its _ successors _ , and then recursively process each successor by either the depth first search ( dfs ) order  the ordering obtained by dfs traversal of the lattice  or breadth first search ( bfs ) order . according to proposition  [ succ - prop ] , successors of a concept 
 can be computed from its children . 
 let @xmath181 be a concept . 
 first , we compute all the children @xmath182 . 
 then for each @xmath150 , we check if @xmath136 is closed . if @xmath136 is closed , @xmath183 is a successor of @xmath19 . 
 since a concept can have several predecessors , it can be generated several times . 
 we check its existence to make sure that each concept is processed once and only once . 
 the pseudo - code of the algorithm based on bfs is shown in algorithm  [ bfs - lattice - alg ] . 
 compute the top concept @xmath184 ; initialize a queue @xmath185 ; compute @xmath186 ;    @xmath187 ; let @xmath188 and suppose @xmath189 ; denote the concept @xmath190 by @xmath191 ; compute @xmath192 ; enqueue @xmath191 to @xmath193 ; identify @xmath191 as a successor of @xmath19 ;      the efficiency of the algorithm depends on the efficient implementation of processing a concept that include three procedures : ( 1 ) computing @xmath194 ; ( 2)testing if an attribute set is closed ; ( 3 ) testing if a concept already exists . 
 first , we describe how to compute @xmath131 in @xmath195 time , using a procedure , called sprout , described in the following lemma .    for @xmath196 , it takes @xmath195 to compute @xmath197 . 
 let @xmath198 . 
 for each @xmath199 , we associate it with a set @xmath99 ( which is initialized as an empty set ) . for each object @xmath200 
 , we scan through each attribute @xmath37 in its neighbor list @xmath201 , append @xmath21 to the set @xmath99 . 
 this step takes @xmath195 . 
 next we collect all the sets @xmath202 . 
 we use a trie to group the same object set : search @xmath99 in the trie ; if not found , insert @xmath99 into the trie with @xmath203 as its attribute set , otherwise we append @xmath37 to @xmath99 s existing attribute set . 
 this step takes @xmath204 . 
 thus , this procedure , called sprout@xmath92 , takes @xmath195 time to compute @xmath131 .    for @xmath150 
 , we test if @xmath136 is closed based on the second characterization in proposition  [ close - prop ] . for this method to work 
 , it requires processing the children @xmath131 in the decreasing order of their object - set size . 
 suppose @xmath205 where @xmath206 before @xmath123 . 
 if @xmath207 is closed , we also compute its children @xmath208 . now to test if @xmath126 is closed , we check if @xmath209 exists . 
 if it does not , then @xmath126 is closed . 
 otherwise , we compare @xmath210 against the size of the existing attribute set of @xmath209 . 
 if @xmath210 is not smaller , then @xmath126 is closed otherwise it is not . to efficiently search @xmath209 
 , we use a trie ( with hashing over each node ) to store the object sets of concepts generated so far and it takes linear time to search and insert ( if not exists ) an object set . 
 that is , it will take @xmath211 time to check if @xmath126 is closed . 
 the total time it takes to check if all children are closed is @xmath212 . 
 recall that a concept @xmath213 is uniquely determined by its extent @xmath214 or its intent @xmath95 . 
 therefore , we can store either the object sets or the attribute sets generated so far in a trie , and then test the existence of @xmath19 by testing the existence of @xmath214 or @xmath95 . 
 since searching the object sets are needed in testing the closure of an attribute set as described above , the cost of testing the existence @xmath214 comes for free . 
 note that @xmath215 . 
 hence , the time it takes to process a concept is dominated by the procedure sprout , in @xmath216 time . 
 if we can reduce the sizes of the adjacency lists ( @xmath217 ) , we can reduce the running time of the algorithm . note that this basic algorithm is already as fast as any existing algorithm for constructing a concept lattice ( or computing all concepts only that takes @xmath7 time where @xmath8 is the maximum size of adjacency lists ) .    in the following 
 we describe how to dynamically update the adjacency lists that will reduce the sizes of adjacent lists , and thus improve the running time of the algorithm . 
 consider a concept @xmath213 , the object sets of all descendants of @xmath19 are all subsets of @xmath214 . to compute the descendants of @xmath19 
 , it suffices to consider the objects with restriction to @xmath214 . for @xmath150 , by definition , all attributes in @xmath218 have the same adjacency lists when restricting to @xmath214 . 
 that is , for all @xmath219 , @xmath220 . 
 in other words , for all @xmath200 , @xmath221 , for all @xmath222 , i.e. , the adjacent list of @xmath21 either contains all elements in @xmath218 or no element in @xmath218 . therefore , we can reduce the sizes of adjacent lists of objects by representing all attributes in @xmath218 by a single element . 
 for example in figure  example2 , we can use a single element @xmath223 to represent the two attributes @xmath142 and @xmath224 , and @xmath225 to represent @xmath145 and @xmath226 . in doing so , 
 we reduce the size of adjacency list of @xmath227 from @xmath226 elements @xmath228 to three elements @xmath229 . 
 we call the reduced adjacency lists the condensed adjacency lists . denoted the condensed adjacent list by @xmath230 
 . the set of condensed adjacency lists corresponds to a reduced cross - table . 
 for example , the reduced cross table of @xmath231 of the above example is shown in figure  [ example2 ] . 
 c@c@c    & &     + ( a ) & ( b ) & ( c )    in order to use the condensed adjacency lists in procedure sprout , we need to process our concepts in bfs order and it requires one extra level , i.e. in a two - level manner . 
 more specifically , for a concept @xmath213 , we first compute all its children @xmath186 . 
 then we dynamically update the adjacency lists by representing the attributes in each child of @xmath19 with one single element . 
 we then use these condensed adjacency lists to process each child of @xmath19 . that is , instead of using the global adjacency lists , when processing @xmath183 , we use the condensed adjacency lists of its parent . 
 it takes @xmath232 for @xmath19 to generate its condensed adjacency lists @xmath230 ( see algorithm  [ condenseadj - procedure ] in the appendix for the pseudo - code ) . 
 and the time for the procedure sprout is @xmath233 ( see algorithm  [ sprout - procedure ] in the appendix for the pseudo - code ) . 
 notice that @xmath234 , the time for updating the adjacency lists is subsumed by the time required for procedure sprout . 
 therefore , our new running time is @xmath233 for each concept @xmath92 
 . see algorithm  [ 2-level - bfs ] for the pseudo - code and figure  [ bfstrees ] for a step - by - step illustration of the algorithm . 
 for some applications , one is not interested in the entire concept lattice . in the following 
 , we will describe how to modify our algorithm to solve two special cases : enumerating all concepts only and constructing a frequent closed itemset lattice .      if one is interested in computing all the concepts and not in their lattice order , as in enumerating all maximal bicliques studied in  @xcite . 
 we can easily modify our algorithm to give an even faster algorithm for this purpose . 
 this is because in our algorithm , each concept is generated many times , more precisely , at least number of its predecessors times . 
 for example in figure  [ bfstrees ] , @xmath235 is generated twice , one by each of its predecessor . however , when we need all concepts only , we do not need regenerate the concepts again and again . 
 this can be easily accomplished by considering the right siblings only in the procedure sprout , i.e. changing the line 3 to @xmath236 , while the other parts of the algorithm remain the same . depending on the lattice structure , this can significantly speed up the algorithm as the number of siblings is decreasing in a cascading fashion . 
 a more careful analysis is needed for the running time of this algorithm .      in data mining , 
 one is interested in large concepts , i.e. @xmath92 where @xmath237 is larger than a threshold . 
 although our algorithm can naturally be modified to construct such a closed itemset lattice : we stop processing a concept when the size of its object set is less than the given threshold , where objects correspond to transactions and attributes correspond to items . 
 theoretically , when the memory requirement is not a concern , our algorithm is faster than all other existing algorithms ( including the state - of - art program charm - l ) for constructing such a frequent closed itemset lattice . 
 however , in practice , for large data sets ( as those studied in data mining ) , the data structure  a trie on objects ( transactions )  requires huge memory and this may threaten the algorithm s practical efficiency . 
 however , it is not difficult to modify our algorithm so that a trie on attributes ( items ) instead is used . 
 recall that a trie on objects are required in two steps of our algorithm : testing the closure of an attribute set and testing the existence of a concept . 
 as noted above , the existence of a concept can also be tested on its intent ( i.e. attributes ) , thus we can use a trie on attributes for testing the existence of a concept . to avoid using a trie on objects for testing the closure of an attribute set , we can use the first characterization in proposition  [ close - prop ] instead , that is , we test the closure of an attribute set by using _ subset testing _ of its object set against its siblings object set , as described in section  [ sec : basic ] . 
 further , we can employ the practically efficient technique _ 
 diffset _ as in charm(-l ) for both our sprout procedure and subset testing operations . 
 we are testing the performance of the diffset based implementation on the available benchmarks and the results will be reported elsewhere . 
 our interest in fca stems from our research in microarray data analysis @xcite . 
 we have implemented an not yet optimized version of our algorithm ( with less than 500 effective lines in c++ ) . 
 the program is very efficient for our applications , in which our data consists of about 10000 objects and 29 attributes . 
 it took less than 1 second for the program to produce the concept lattice ( about 530 vertices / concepts and 1500 edges ) in a pentium iv 3.0ghz computer with 2 g memory running under fedora 2 linux os . 
 the program is available upon request at this point and will release to the public in the near future .    as fca finds more and more applications , especially in bioinformatics , efficient algorithms for constructing concept / galois lattices 
 are much needed . 
 our algorithm is faster than the existing algorithms for this problem , nevertheless , it seems to have much room to improve .

34,"in the last few years , there has been a surge of publications reporting reliable constraints on the transmission spectra of extrasolar planets . using _ 
 hst_/wfc3 , many of these publications have reported the detection of ho , thus revealing insight into their chemical makeup . however , a substantial fraction have also reported statistically flat transmission spectra , which inhibit further characterization and understanding . 
 the strength of the measured water feature can be reduced by the presence of obscuring clouds / hazes , high metallicities causing high mean molecular weight atmospheres , and/or an extremely low ho abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 however , the production of clouds and hazes is generally believed to be the most common mechanism for causing muted spectroscopic features in exoplanet spectra that have been obtained so far @xcite . 
 it is important to understand why some planets have predominantly cloud - free atmospheres , thus revealing insight into their compositions , while others appear to contain high - altitude clouds or hazes that obscure our measurements . 
 the ability to predict the presence of obscuring clouds / hazes _ a priori _ can increase telescope efficiency by allowing future investigations to concentrate on targets most likely to contain relatively clear atmospheres and strong spectroscopic signals . 
 this is especially true for the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , which is scheduled to launch in 2018 @xcite . 
 the goal of this investigation is to use exoplanets physical properties to predict the strength of spectroscopic features ( thus inferring the presence of clouds / hazes ) in the near - infrared . 
 for example , the correlation between clouds and temperature is well known in brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . 
 there is also evidence for a cloud - gravity dependence near the l - t transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 using high - precision , space - based transmission spectra , we look for similar correlations in our sample exoplanet population . 
 the layout of this paper is as follows . 
 section [ sec : proc ] describes our procedure for quantifying the strength of the water feature using the ho    j index . in section [ sec : results ] , we investigate possible trends between our sample planet population s reported ho 
 j index values and their physical properties . finally , section [ sec : future ] discusses what future observations are needed to refine our constraints and further our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres . 
 in taking our first step , we look to select a sample population of transiting exoplanets with well - characterized atmospheres . although there is a significant cumulation of _ spitzer space telescope _ transit data and increasing efforts to obtain ground - based transmission spectra of exoplanets , for this investigation 
 we limit our sample population to only include _ hst_/wfc3 data acquired with the g141 grism . 
 these high - precision spectra have been shown to reliably and repeatably resolve the water feature centered at 1.4 m without confusion from other absorption features or variability caused by earth s atmosphere . 
 furthermore , the _ hst_/wfc3 sample population is both significant in size and diverse in their physical properties . 
 [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^ , < "" , ]     next , we need to establish wavelength regions both inside and outside of our selected spectroscopic feature . we define two spectral regions : ( 1 ) the peak of the broad water feature from 1.36 to 1.44 m and ( 2 ) a j - band baseline from 1.22 to 1.30 m ( see figure [ fig : h2o - j ] ) . compared to brown dwarf measurements , 
 exoplanet transmission spectra have a higher degree of uncertainty ; therefore , we have chosen relatively wide spectral regions to improve the precision of our comparisons . 
 also , authors report transit depths or radius ratios using spectrophotometric bins of varying widths ; therefore , utilizing wide spectral windows minimizes the effects of having slightly offset spectral regions for different planets ( see table [ tab : planetparams ] ) . 
 establishing new transit depths over our specified spectral regions would require reanalyzing all of the available _ hst_/wfc3 data and is outside the scope of this investigation . 
 future analyses , however , are encouraged to report transit depths and uncertainties over these two spectral regions . as a cautionary note , 
 using a dual - band measure of the water feature strength has its limitations . 
 inherently noisy spectra ( e.g. , hd  97658b , * ? ? ? 
 * ) may not exhibit distinct water features , but can still produce ho 
 j index values > 1 if the measured transit depths exhibit wavelength - dependent trends .     defined wavelength regions to estimate the strength of a planet s water feature . for each planet with a published _ 
 hst_/wfc3 transmission spectrum , we compute the difference in transit depth between these two spectral regions and convert to units of atmospheric scale height . 
 this defines the ho    j index . ]    for our third step , we are concerned with establishing a universal metric to which planets with varying physical properties can be compared . for this 
 , we adopt the atmospheric scale height , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath0 is the planet s equilibrium temperature , @xmath8 is the atmospheric mean molecular weight , and @xmath9 is the planet s surface gravity ( in mks units ) . for planets with @xmath10 jupiter - radii , we adopt jupiter s atmospheric mean molecular weight ( @xmath8 = 2.2  u ) . for planets with @xmath11 jupiter - radii , we compute an atmospheric mean molecular weight of 3.8  u using the prescription of @xcite and assuming 80@xmath12solar metallicity , which is comparable to both uranus and neptune @xcite . 
 all of the planets in our sample are expected to have h / he - dominated atmospheres @xcite . 
 one advantage of adopting the scale height as our metric is that it accounts for differences in our sample population s equilibrium temperatures and surface gravities , two prominent factors thought to affect the production of clouds and hazes in exoplanet atmospheres .    for each planet 
 , we compute the scale height using the @xmath0 and @xmath13 values listed in table [ tab : planetparams ] , which we derive from data provided by the exoplanet orbit database ( www.exoplanets.org , * ? ? ? 
 our @xmath0 calculation assumes zero albedo and full heat redistribution . 
 for ease of calculation , we convert the scale height of each planet into a change in transit depth , @xmath14 , using the following relation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath16 are the planet and stellar radii , respectively . 
 therefore , @xmath14 is the change in transit depth that corresponds to a one - scale - height change in altitude and serves as a normalizing factor between planetary systems with different physical properties . 
 next , we compute the difference in transit depth between our two spectral regions , ensuring to propagate uncertainties , then divide by @xmath14 for each planet . 
 this defines the ho 
 j index , which quantifies the fractional change in atmospheric scale height between our two spectral regions . 
 for the purposes of this investigation , we discard planets whose ho 
 j index uncertainties are larger than one scale height ; this includes gj  3470b , tres-2b , tres-4b , and corot-1b . due to their large uncertainties , 
 these measurements are uninformative and only serve to obfuscate trends in certain figures . 
 table [ tab : planetparams ] lists the remaining ho 
 j index values in units of scale height .    finally , to allow for a more intuitive understanding 
 , we qualitatively describe the state of a planet s atmosphere assuming that changes in the ho 
 j index value are solely a function of cloud cover . 
 planets with the largest ho 
 j index values ( @xmath17 2 ) are likely to have cloud - free atmospheres at the depths probed by the wfc3 measurements . 
 those with values between one and two may be thought of as having partially cloudy to mostly clear skies , or a thin haze layer . 
 planet atmospheres with ho 
 j index values less than unity have the weakest water features ( if any ) that are likely caused by increased cloud cover or haze thickness at or above the probed depths . 
 after exploring how the water - feature strength varies as a function of the planets physical properties ( i.e. mass , radius , temperature , rotation rate , etc . ) , we find that the ho    j index is strongly correlated with equilibrium temperature and weakly correlated with surface gravity ( typically expressed as @xmath13 ) . the top panel of figure [ fig : teqlogg ] illustrates this dependence by dividing the sample population into two `` classes '' of exoplanets using ho    j  =  1 as a borderline . those with ho 
 j @xmath17 1 are bounded in phase space by @xmath0 @xmath18  k and @xmath19 . 
 recall that for these planets , any putative atmospheric clouds would play only a minor role in altering the strength of the measured water features . 
 conversely , for the sample population with ho    j @xmath20 1 , clouds and/or hazes likely play an important role in muting their spectroscopic features .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : teqlogg ] 
 , we include a best - fit 2d model that simultaneously fits the temperature and gravity dependence . 
 this model consists of four quadrants separated by freely - varying transition ( or knot ) values . above the temperature and gravity knot values ( quadrant i ) 
 , we adopt a constant ho 
 j index value ( one free parameter , @xmath21 ) because the available data exhibit no significant trend . 
 quadrants ii and iv assume linear dependences in gravity and temperature , respectively ( two free parameters each , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) . to complete the model , we apply bilinear interpolation in quadrant iii . 
 the final model contains five free parameters and the knot values are computed at each step of our markov - chain monte carlo analysis ( mcmc , * ? ? ? 
 we derive the following median parameter values with 1@xmath24 uncertainties : @xmath21 = @xmath3  h , @xmath22 = @xmath25  h / dex , @xmath23 = @xmath26  h , @xmath22 = @xmath27  h / k , and @xmath23 = @xmath28  h. interestingly , quadrant iv from the best - fit model does not contain any planets from our sample , but the free parameters are tightly constrained by the population in quadrant iii . 
 nonetheless , the model would benefit from having _ hst_/wfc3 measurements within this region . 
 we derive a median transition temperature of @xmath29  k and a median transition @xmath13 of @xmath30  dex . with 14 data points and five free parameters 
 , our best - fit model achieves a @xmath31 value of 19.8 . 
 water feature strength as a function of equilibrium temperature and surface gravity . 
 the nine planets with strong measured water features ( ho    j @xmath17 1 , blue squares ) have @xmath0 @xmath18  k and @xmath19 ( dotted lines ) . the remaining five planets with ho    j @xmath20 1 ( red squares ) have muted water features . 
 the size of the squares is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in the ho 
 j index , thus larger symbols carry more weight . 
 like the dotted lines , the dashed diagonal line also delineates these two `` classes '' of exoplanets . within the top panel , 
 the gray circles depict confirmed transiting exoplanets with known masses and radii . 
 the coloring in the bottom panel depicts the best - fit 2d model segmented into four quadrants ( yellow lines and numerals ) . 
 additional measurements are needed to more precisely determine the transition region for atmospheres with and without obscuring clouds / hazes at the depths probed by wfc3 .

 , title=""fig : "" ]    we test our proposed temperature dependence by computing the variance - weighted experimental linear - correlation coefficient , @xmath32 , which ranges from -1 to 1 @xcite . 
 the three planets in quadrant iii have @xmath33 , indicating a near - total positive correlation between planet temperature and water feature size , and a p - value of 0.092 . 
 conversely , the planets in quadrants i and ii have @xmath34 , which is consistent with no correlation . 
 next , we repeat the test using surface gravity as the correlating parameter . the eight planets in quadrant ii exhibit a moderate positive correlation ( @xmath35 ) with a relatively small p - value ( 0.053 ) . the three planets in quadrant 
 i have a surprisingly strong negative correlation ( @xmath36 ) with surface gravity , but they also have large uncertainties on their ho 
 j index values and a large p - value ( 0.18 ) . 
 so , we repeat this test while including three additional planets from quadrant ii with @xmath37 ( the 1@xmath24 lower limit on the transition surface gravity ) . in this case 
 , we find a much weaker correlation ( @xmath38 ) that suggests a larger sample size is needed in quadrant i before any conclusions can be drawn .      here 
 we further examine the ho 
 j index dependence on planet temperature . 
 the top panel of figure [ fig : teqdep ] plots the water feature strength ( with uncertainties ) versus equilibrium temperature for all 14 exoplanets in our sample population . from this , it is clear that the model is strongly influenced by the relatively small uncertainties of gj  1214b and hd  209458b . fitting a linear trend to the entire dataset 
 ( not shown ) results in a 8@xmath24 detection of a slope , thus suggesting a strong temperature dependence at face value . 
 however , the quality of the fit is relatively poor ( @xmath39 ) , thus justifying the use of our more complex model ( discussed above ) . with an improved fit ( @xmath40 ) 
 , we report a correlation between the water feature size and planet temperature at 3.1@xmath24 confidence when @xmath0  <  750  k.     ho

 the symbol size is proportional to planet radius and symbol color is proportional to @xmath13 .

 the blue and green lines with colored 1@xmath24 uncertainty regions are representative models at two different surface gravities ( @xmath41 and 2.7  dex , respectively ) .

 the bottom panel shows no discernible correlation between the residuals and planet temperature.,title=""fig : "" ]    next , we consider how planet radius might affect the water feature size because the four coolest planets are also the smallest . 
 the sub - neptune - size planet hd  97658b ( 2.25  @xmath42 ) is smaller than gj 1214b ( 2.68  @xmath42 ) , but it has a larger ho    j index value ( 1.850.91 vs.  0.020.10 ) . 
 furthermore , hat - p-11b is comparable in size to gj 436b but has the largest ho    j index value ( 3.470.72 vs.  0.540.46 ) . 
 these examples argue against a strong correlation between the ho    j index value and planet radius . 
 it may be relevant that the two coolest planets both orbit m dwarf stars because their intense uv radiation may facilitate the production of obscuring aerosols . 
 therefore , as a critical next step , we recommend additional high - precision _ hst_/wfc3 measurements of jupiter - size exoplanets with @xmath0 = 500  700  k and orbiting f , g , or k stars to validate the reported temperature dependence . 
 the bottom panel of figure [ fig : teqdep ] plots the ho 
 j index residuals from our best - fit model versus planet temperature . 
 we note that 57% of our sample population are within 1@xmath24 of zero and 86% are within 2@xmath24 . 
 the scatter in the residuals may be reduced by applying more sophisticated models or examining correlations between the ho    j index and other physical parameters not considered in this analysis . 
 most wfc3 light curves do not exhibit time - correlated ( red ) noise and model fits tend to be repeatable and near the photon limit ; therefore , the ho 
 j index uncertainties are not likely to be significantly underestimated .    the temperature dependence of our best - fit model , including the @xmath29  k transition temperature , 
 may be explained by the production of photochemical hazes @xcite . at temperatures below @xmath431100  k 
 , ch becomes the dominant carbon - bearing molecule for an atmosphere in thermochemical equilibrium . 
 methane photochemistry , which is initiated by the absorption of incident uv radiation , results in the formation of soot precursors such as acetylene ( ch ) and hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) in the upper atmospheric layers that can then lead to the production of hazes . 
 @xcite find that as planet temperatures decrease towards 500  k , soot - precursor production peaks and does so at higher altitudes , thus muting the size of spectroscopic features and reducing ho 
 j index values . 
 they also predict soot precursor production to slow below @xmath43500  k ; therefore , more temperate exoplanet atmospheres could return to clearer skies and the ho    j index may rebound to values greater than unity . however , the presence of water ice clouds for objects below @xmath43350  k may again mute spectral features @xcite . 
 relative to planet temperature , we detect a weak correlation between the ho 
 j index and surface gravity . in the top panel of figure [ fig : loggdep ] , we plot the calculated ho 
 j index values ( with uncertainties ) as a function of surface gravity for our entire sample population . 
 the correlation between these two parameters is difficult to assess without accounting for the temperature dependence . 
 nevertheless , the two representative models at fixed equilibrium temperatures clearly show a decreasing trend towards lower - gravity planets . 
 the significance of this trend is 2.9@xmath24 . 
 the addition of a precise measurement from a low - surface - gravity exoplanet would improve this significance while providing another data point within a poorly sampled region of phase space . 
 the bottom panel of figure [ fig : loggdep ] displays the same ho 
 j index residuals as figure [ fig : teqdep ] , except plotted as a function of surface gravity .     ho

 the bottom panel shows no discernible correlation between the residuals and surface gravity.,title=""fig : "" ]    one possible explanation for the gradual decrease in water feature size with decreasing surface gravity is an increase in vertical mixing efficiency . 
 this is because as surface gravity decreases , the eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath44 ) increases @xcite . as a result , 
 enhanced vertical mixing could loft more soot precursors to higher altitudes within the atmosphere where they would effectively reduce the size of spectroscopic features . however 
 , increased photochemical production does not always occur under all atmospheric conditions and requires that soot precursors can initially form within the atmosphere , which is most likely for planets with temperatures between 500  800  k @xcite . 
 our sample of low - gravity exoplanets are all hotter than 800  k on their daysides , but their nightside temperatures are likely cool enough to favor the production of methane ( and higher hydrocarbons ) in thermochemcial equilibrium . 
 it remains to be seen whether high - altitude hazes can be produced on a low - gravity planet s nightside and whether they can remain optically thick at the planet terminator as they are transported to the dayside . 
 since photochemical hazes are not favored at higher temperatures , another possible explanation is the presence of obscuring clouds . 
 low - gravity environments can hamper particulate sedimentation , resulting in high - altitude cloud formation . 
 as an example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report on three kepler planets ( kepler-7b , kepler-12b , and kepler-42b ) with asymmetric optical - light phase curves . 
 they attribute the westward shift in peak brightness ( relative to the substellar point ) to the formation of reflective clouds . 
 interestingly , the lowest - gravity planets ( kepler-7b and kepler-12b , which have @xmath45 and 2.57  dex , respectively ) have the strongest asymmetry in their phase curves . 
 silicates such as enstatite ( mgsio ) and forsterite ( mgsio ) are both highly reflective and condense at high altitudes ( @xmath46 < 0.01 bar ) between 1,500  2,000  k @xcite . 
 thus , in addition to the kepler planets , patchy silicate clouds can naturally explain the low ho 
 j index values reported here for wasp-17b and wasp-31b . 
 in this investigation into correlations between water feature size and planet physical properties , we find that the ho    j index is strongly correlated ( @xmath47 , p - value = 0.092 ) with planet temperature when @xmath0@xmath1  k and moderately correlated ( @xmath48 , p - value = 0.053 ) with surface gravity for planets with @xmath2  dex . 
 however , we need additional , high - precision measurements from planets with key physical attributes to refine these thresholds and develop a more complete understanding of these transition regions . in particular , the low - gravity regime is poorly sampled and lacks a high - precision constraint to definitively confirm a surface gravity dependence . 
 additionally , _ hst_/wfc3 measurements of a 500  800  k jupiter - size exoplanet orbiting an f , g , or k star are needed to definitively rule out links between water feature size and planet radius or host star type . 
 future studies , particularly those with _ jwst _ , will be able to utilize additional indices over an expanded wavelength range to further subdivide these two classes of exoplanets and examine additional factors that might affect the size of spectroscopic features ( such as patchy cloud cover and metallicity ) . until then 
 , these results can serve as a guide for the selection of future targets while enhancing our understanding of past measurements .

35,"understanding the mechanisms of learning and maintenance of effective behavior in stochastic environments with complex hierarchy of goals is one of key issues in the study of neural processing and for the development of bio - inspired artificial intelligence . 
 however , these mechanisms are better understood if history of their development is taken into account .    fields of machine learning and adaptive behavior have been rapidly developing in the recent decades . 
 one of the most popular approaches in these areas is reinforcement learning ( rl ) @xcite and its modifications . it can be effectively used for learning of autonomous agents in many domains . 
 however , problem spaces with multiple goals require execution of alternative behavioral strategies that are not possible for rl algorithms , since the behavior of the agent is determined by the single value function . 
 also , it is not always possible to define appropriate value function _ a priori_. to address this issue approaches for the generation of reinforcement values using evolutionary algorithms are currently under development @xcite . 
 other algorithms are also unable to produce effective solution for the environments with hierarchy of goals @xcite . 
 the various methods designed for the generation of behavioral sequences @xcite in most cases can not effectively work in situations with a large number of goals present in the environment and when an agent has to autonomously explore them . 
 neuroevolutionary approaches have been successfully used for the synthesis of autonomous agent s controllers in low - formalized tasks @xcite .    to solve the problem of alternative behaviors 
 the algorithm should implement non - markov decision process in opposite to reinforcement learning @xcite . 
 in other words for selection of different actions at the same state of the environment an agent should have memory of previous actions . 
 short - term memory ( stm ) is extensively covered in the area of recurrent neural networks research in terms of the signal reverberation @xcite and serial order recall @xcite . 
 theorists suggested reverberation phenomenon as significant mechanism for stm @xcite . nevertheless neural principles underlying generation of the behavior as a non - linear integration of the sensory information and internal state of the network are not yet discovered . as well 
 the question of the role stm plays in the adaptive behavior with alternative actions is still underexplored .    in this paper 
 we present a model of an agent situated in an environment with hierarchy of goals . 
 the behavior of the agent is controlled by recurrent neural network . 
 we simulated evolution of agents in the model world and studied emergence of short - term memory and its role in adaptive behavior . 
 in the current study a state of an environment in which an autonomous agent `` lives '' is represented by binary vector :    @xmath0    at any discrete time step the agent may change a single bit of this vector to the opposite . 
 thus , environmental structure is a @xmath1-dimensional hypercube . 
 every dimension of this hypercube might be interpreted as some feature of the real environment , for instance temperature , pressure , etc . 
 competing goals of different complexity are prespecified in the environment as an ordered set of single bit changes of the environmental state vector :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a number of target bit of the state vector , @xmath4 is target value of the bit , @xmath5 is a complexity of the goal 
 . goals of varying complexity are defined in the environment , together forming a branched hierarchical structure . 
 we have generated structure of the environment by , firstly , composing hierarchy of full goals and then each goal was divided into sequence of subgoals . 
 to determine the complexity of a particular environment we introduce occupancy based on a probabilistic approach :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the number of goals in an environment , @xmath8 is the number of unique bits of the state vector , changed during the process of achieving a goal ( single bit can be changed several times ) . 
 the value , which is opposite to the occupancy , we shall call the difficulty of the environment :    @xmath9    reward is associated with each goal in the environment and directly proportional to the complexity of corresponding goal . after the agent reached goal , level of accruing reward associated with this goal is reset and then linearly recovers to the original value over the time @xmath10 
 .    environment can be either deterministic or non - deterministic . in the later changes of the state vector 
 occur not only when the agent performs actions , but also stochastically according with a fixed probability . 
 agent s behavior in the environment is controlled by artificial neural network ( ann ) of arbitrary topology , which develops through the evolutionary process . 
 ann is divided into input , output and number of hidden layers . 
 the network consists of mcculloch - pitts neurons with nonnegative logistic activation function . 
 signal passes through the synapse only when output value of a presynaptic neuron is above a certain activation threshold ( was set to 0.5 in all simulations ) . 
 thus , we introduce two possible states for each neuron : active ( when output is above a threshold ) and inactive ( otherwise ) . 
 the current state vector of the environment is directly fed to the neurons of input layer of the network . 
 hidden layers allow existence of recurrent connections with delayed transmission . 
 pair of the most active neurons of output layer encodes agent s action at the current time step . 
 each pair stands for a particular bit of the state vector and target value . 
 thereby transfers of a bit from 0 to 1 and vice versa are encoded by different pairs of the output neurons . 
 the agent could produce ineffective actions , when attempts to change a state of a bit to one in which it already is . 
 population of agents evolves in the hypercube environment described in previous section . 
 every individual is separately placed in the environment to evaluate fitness . for a given time the agent operates in the environment , reaching goals and accumulating reward . 
 value of accumulated reward is inaccessible to the agent and total reward affects its reproductive success .    to evolve agents anns we used neuroevolutionary algorithm based on duplication of neurons . 
 this algorithm is similar to well - known neat @xcite as it makes possible evolution of neural network topology but in more natural way by duplicating neurons with attached connections . 
 specifically we use _ 
 neuron s duplication _ mutation when duplicated neuron inherits from parent the whole synaptic structure instead of _ add node _ mutation of neat . 
 incoming connections of the descendant and parent neurons retain its previous weights , while weights of outgoing connections divided in half for both neurons . 
 thus , two neurons in the aggregate perform the former function , but later in evolution the descendant neuron could diverge into a separate structure . to optimize evolution by 
 dynamically reducing dimensionality of the search space we also introduced _ delete connection _ mutation , which performed in the same manner as _ add connection _ mutation . 
 neurons that lost all their connections are being deleted from the network . 
 we did not use any crossover algorithm , since preliminary results of comparison between two versions of evolutionary algorithm ( with crossover and without ) have not showed significantly difference . 
 the structure of the agents networks in initial population consists of input and output layers and one additional interneuron , which will be an ancestor for all future interneurons . 
 this initial interneuron is fully connected to input layer ( by incoming connections ) and to output layer , herewith there are no initial direct connections between input and output neurons . 
 we used the following parameters of the artificial environment in all simulations : dimensionality of the hypercube environment @xmath1  8 bits ; agent lifetime duration @xmath11  250 time steps ; reward s recovery time @xmath10  30 time steps ; probability of random change of the state vector s bit @xmath12  0.0085 ( for each bit ) . 
 evolutionary algorithm was running with parameters : population @xmath13  250 agents ; period of evolution @xmath14  5000 generations ; probability of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath15  0.6 ( for each synapse ) ; variance of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath16  0.08 ; probability of adding the synapse @xmath17  0.1 ( for whole network ) ; probability of deleting the synapse @xmath18  0.05 ( for whole network ) ; probability of neuron s duplication @xmath19  0.007 ( for whole network ) . 
 as the first step we studied how occupancy of the environment affects efficiency of evolved behavior in deterministic and stochastic environments . 
 as expected the simulation results show the growth of an average cumulative reward with increase of the occupancy , reflecting that a task is easier when the environment is more densely populated with goals ( fig . 
 [ fig : statevolution ] ) . 
 agents evolved in non - deterministic environments behave significantly more successfully ( fig . 
 [ fig : statevolution ] ) in terms of average accumulated reward and in most cases have richer repertoires of behavior . 
 such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that during the `` life '' in an environment which could suddenly change the agent with a wider spectrum of behavioral policies should be more successful . 
 thus stochasticity of the environment contributes to the selection of agents with more flexible and robust behavior , allowing them to reach greater number of goals from different initial position . 
 however , with increasing probability of random changes in the environment one can observe a sharp decline in the efficiency of the evolution ( data not shown ) due to the destabilization of all policies caused by excessively frequent changes in the environment . 
 we then analyzed evolution of behavioral sequences of the agents in the environment of intermediate goal occupancy . 
 typical evolved behavior usually consists of two phases : preliminary phase of converging to the main behavioral cycle and then residing on it . in a particular behavioral run 
 both of these phases depend on the initial state of the environment , from which the agent has been started . 
 we shall call the main behavioral cycle ( sequence of actions or attained goals ) a behavioral strategy 
 .    results of simulations demonstrate that sharp increase in the average cumulative reward among the population usually coincides with emergence of a large number of new cycles and their dynamic competition . 
 corresponding periods are the most interesting in the study of behavioral evolution . on the fig . 
 [ fig : behevolution ] we give an example of such period . 
 one can observe competition between different behavioral strategies during a very limited evolutionary period . 
 herewith new strategies are appearing as an extension of previously evolved cycles . 
 extension can be implemented not only as simple addition of a new part to an old one , but also as complex compilation of two strategies . 
 eventually one of the strategies wins the competition and dominates in the behavior of the most of the population . 
 then evolution occurs through increase in number of states , from which it could be implemented . 
 the analysis of behavioral strategies emerging in the simulated evolution shows that the agents acquire ability to store short - term memory due to reverberation in the neural network by recurrent connections . 
 the evidence for short - term memory comes from the fact that agents can implement policies based on alternative actions . 
 agents usually can perform different actions from one state of the environment depending on the previous history of behavior . 
 state transition diagram for the exemplar evolved behavior with three alternative actions is shown on the fig . 
 [ fig : alternativebehavior ] . 
 such phenomenon would not been possible in the case of reactivity work of the neural network . 
 corresponding behavior is generated by a neural network consists of 30 neurons with only 15 interneurons and 611 synaptic connections . 
 only a small number of neurons significantly change output and affect the decision making at states associated with alternative situations . 
 this group of neurons is specialized on particular alternative actions . 
 the majority of neurons remain at the same level of activity , while neurons which determine a behavior change their activity from zero to maximum level . 
 based on the various behavioral policies the deepest short - term memory we found was at least 4 past states ( lower bound ) . 
 such conclusion was made after considering situations in which alternative actions are performed with the same history of behavior and , thus , the lower bound can be determined as the first different action of the two behavioral sequences . 
 the ability to use short - term memory makes possible implementation of much more complex behavior and accumulation of more reward during the agent s `` life '' . 
 example of a behavioral strategy , based on the alternation of two cycles of actions , is shown on the fig . 
 [ fig : behstrategy ] . 
 since after the goal is reached it restores the reward for a fixed number of time steps , such a strategy allows goals that were reached on the first cycle to restore their value , while the agent passes the second cycle . 
 behavior on the fig . 
 [ fig : behstrategy ] can be implemented using short - term memory with depth of two states .    primitive alternative behavior in the model 
 could also be supported by slow neurodynamical process ( fig . 
 [ fig : slowprocess ] ) . in this case 
 the `` memory '' , required to perform alternative actions , could be up to 30 previous states . 
 the mechanism underling this type of behavior is oscillatory dynamic of the neuron s output . 
 while output of a neuron is above threshold , and therefore transmitted by outgoing connections , agent performs the first part of behavior . at some point output falls below the transmission threshold and the neuron no longer inhibits the other neuron , which activity is essential for the second branch of behavior .        in the records of neural network activity ( fig . 
 [ fig : rasterplot ] ) during the entire period of autonomous agent s behavior one can identify both neurons , that are active while performing most of the actions , and neurons , that are active only in a very limited number of states of the environment ( sometimes even in a single state ) . 
 in our study we have explored possibility of evolutionary emergence of short - term memory in recurrent neural networks controlling agents behavior in multi - goal environments . on the first stage we analyzed overall dynamics of a model . as expected , performance of agents was worse when the number of goals in environment was smaller . on the other hand it turned out surprisingly that in stochastic environments agents with more flexible and stable behavioral policies evolve and able to accumulate more reward in comparison to agents in the same environment but without noise . 
 this phenomenon is quite unusual for machine learning algorithms @xcite , since in the case of non - deterministic environment the performance is usually worse . 
 detailed investigation of evolutionary dynamics revealed that the evolution of agents consisted of two stages : rapid emergence / development of new behavioral strategies and their propagation among the population . 
 formation of new strategies was usually manifested as complex integration of few already existed .    on the level of individual behavior we found that evolution develops strategies , which are based on alternative actions . 
 that happens due to acquisition of ability to operate with short - term memory and , therefore , to select actions taking into account previous history of behavior . 
 evolution discovered two different neuronal mechanisms for implementation of alternative actions : first one is based on integration of sensory information and internal signal , which is reverberating through recurrent connections ; and the second is based on slow neurodynamical oscillatory processes . in fact , there is no need to recruit synaptic plasticity during the agent s `` life '' to have an effective use of short - term memory . 
 it is important to notice that emergence of the ability to operate with short - term memory in our model occurs without any artificial prerequisites in the structure of an evolutionary algorithm . 
 the next stage of presented study is introduction of learning during agent s `` life '' , since it makes significant contribution into development of adaptive behavior . 
 the main mechanism of learning algorithm is detection on the neuronal level of problems for the whole organism situated in environment . 
 possible approach to the construction of such algorithm is the use of research in the theoretical neuroscience @xcite .

36,"ultraviolet observations of the atmospheres of venus and mars , primarily from fly - by or orbiting spacecraft , but also from platforms above the terrestrial atmosphere , have played an important role in the study of the composition and structure of the  atmospheres of these planets . 
 early spacecraft experiments were broad - band photometers that provided information about the spatial distribution of the emissions in the passband but required remote spectroscopic measurements to assure the identity of the emitting species . 
 a thorough review of this subject is given by @xcite . 
 once the emitting species were known , narrowband polychromators were developed and flown on missions such as _ mariner 10 _ @xcite and _ venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ @xcite , although the interpretation of the data from these instruments was far from unambiguous . with _ 
 mariners 6 , 7 _ and _ 9 _ , flown to mars in the early 1970s , and _ 
 pioneer venus orbiter _ launched to venus in 1978 
 , ultraviolet spectrometers were included in the payloads and provided modest spectral resolution . 
 very little additional spectroscopy , particularly from newer generations of earth - orbiting observatories such as the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , has been done and is also summarized by @xcite . in february 1990 , _ galileo _ flew by venus on its way to jupiter and the ultraviolet spectrometers on board made observations that were reported by @xcite . 
 the flight of the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) on the astro-2 mission on the space shuttle _ endeavour _ in march 1995 provided an opportunity to measure the ultraviolet disk spectra of both venus and mars at a spectral resolution ( @xmath9  ) significantly higher than any of the prior spacecraft observations . moreover , since the first order spectral range of hut extended to wavelengths as short as 830  , the observations of venus enabled the resolution of the identity of the emissions recorded in the narrow - band photometric channels of the _ venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ euv instruments that had been interpreted in terms of analogue terrestrial spectra @xcite . 
 this paper presents the hut disk spectra of venus and mars together with the spectral identifications and the disk - averaged brightnesses . 
 co fluorescence in both the @xmath6 ( 0,0 ) and @xmath10 ( 0,0 ) birge - hopfield bands is identified in both venus and mars and shown to be consistent with current models of the co/  mixing ratios in the atmospheres of these planets . 
 several other emissions are definitively identified for the first time . 
 the hut instrument consists of a 0.9-m sic coated mirror that feeds a prime focus spectrograph with a photon - counting microchannel plate detector and photodiode array readout . 
 details of the instrument and its performance and calibration are given by @xcite and @xcite . 
 the spectrograph covered 820    1840   in first order with a dispersion of 0.51   per pixel . 
 the absolute calibration , monitored several times during the mission by observations of pure hydrogen white dwarfs , is considered accurate to better than 5% at all wavelengths longward of 912   @xcite . for the observations reported here 
 , the @xmath11 diameter spectrograph aperture was used , and was underfilled by both venus and mars . 
 the mean spectral resolution was determined by the diameter of the planet , 151 for venus and 122 for mars , and the illuminated fraction , giving a resolution of 44.5   over the entire spectral band .    at the time of the astro-2 mission , 
 venus was at a solar elongation slightly inside the 45  solar avoidance constraint of hut . nevertheless , 
 since the performance of hut and the supporting instrument pointing system was nominal after ten days of the mission , it was decided to attempt to observe venus at a solar elongation of 402 . 
 this observation occurred at ut 05:25 on 13 march 1995 and produced no adverse heating of the telescope assembly nor appreciably elevated scattered light . 
 a second observation was made about 9 hours later . 
 both observations were made during orbit day . 
 a spectrum of venus from the first observation is shown in figure  [ spectv1 ] . 
 it includes not only the desired disk spectrum of venus but also contributions from the terrestrial day airglow . 
 the earth s dayglow includes  lyman-@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , as well as emissions of atomic and ionic oxygen and atomic nitrogen that are also present in the dayglow of venus . 
 fortuitously , it took longer to acquire and lock onto venus during the second observation so there are @xmath0500 seconds of background data taken during this observation that correspond to approximately the same viewing geometry ( with respect to the earth s atmosphere ) as when venus was in the aperture during the first observation . 
 this is illustrated in figure  [ time ] , which shows the count rates for two of the brighter emissions ,  1304 and  1200 , as a function of time for both observations . 
 figure  [ spectv2 ] shows two 516 second integrations , venus + earth and earth alone . 
 the difference spectrum is then the true spectrum of venus , and this spectrum is used to derive the disk brightnesses for the , , and  emissions listed in table  [ tab1 ] . for the other emissions , 
 the longer exposure spectrum of figure  [ spectv1 ] is used . 
 the error bars given in table  [ tab1 ] are 1-@xmath13 statistical uncertainties in the observed counts within a given emission feature . 
 mars was observed during orbit night beginning at ut 22:33 on 12 march 1995 . 
 the hut spectrum of mars is shown in figure  [ spectm ] , and the derived disk brightnesses are also listed in table  [ tab1 ] . 
 the hut observations of venus and mars represent the highest quality spectra , in terms of both spectral resolution and instrument sensitivity , obtained to date for the ultraviolet below 1800  . 
 the present discussion will focus on the identification of spectral features and comparison with previous observations . 
 future work will concern the modelling of these spectra in terms of current atmospheric models based on _ in situ _ measurements made over the past two decades @xcite .      below 2000  , 
 the ultraviolet dayglow of venus and mars is dominated by emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon @xcite . from both fig . 
 [ spectv1 ] and fig . 
 [ spectm ] we see that a large number of individual bands of the co fourth positive ( @xmath1   @xmath2 ) system are clearly identified . when compared with calculated optically thin fluorescence efficiencies ( `` g - factors '' ) for this system @xcite , the effect of the twenty - fold increase in the mean  absorption cross - section from 1700 to 1500   @xcite 
 is clearly seen in the enhancement of the weaker longer wavelength bands . 
 in addition , the co is optically thick in that the expected strong ( @xmath14 ) bands are particularly weak implying that photons are being pumped out of these bands into other members of the ( @xmath15 ) progression by repeated absorption and re - emission . 
 bands of the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) progressions , pumped by solar  and  1304 , respectively @xcite , are clearly seen , particularly the ( 14,3 ) band at 1316   and the ( 9,2 ) band at 1378  , both of which are free of blending by other co bands or atomic emissions . 
 the strong emission feature at @xmath18   is a blend of  1356 and the co ( 14,4 ) band at 1352  , the strongest in the solar  pumped progression , with most of the observed emission due to co.    other observed features include the co hopfield - birge bands , @xmath3 
 @xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1151   and @xmath4 
 @xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1088  , which are identified for the first time in the spectra of venus and mars . 
 they appear to be present in the _ galileo _ euv spectrum of venus @xcite , but can not be positively identified at the 30   resolution of that instrument . 
 the @xmath6 band is blended with emission from  1152 . at first sight , 
 the relative intensities of these bands and the similarity with low energy electron impact laboratory spectra @xcite , suggest that excitation of co by photoelectrons is a major source of the emission . 
 however , as is shown in section 3.2 , it is possible to account for the observed brightness of the @xmath19 ( 0,0 ) band solely on the basis of resonance fluorescence of solar ultraviolet radiation . 
 no other bands of either of these systems is detected , as expected from the strongly diagonal nature of both band systems and the high pre - dissociation fractions for @xmath20 @xcite . 
 there is also a weak indication of the @xmath5 
 @xmath2  ( 0,0 ) band at 1076   in the spectrum of venus . 
 in addition to the principal  multiplets at 1561 and 1657  , a number of other atomic carbon lines are identified in fig . 
 [ spectv1 ] . 
 some of these , the multiplets at 1329 , 1280 , 1277 and 1261  , were identified in the _ mariner 6 _ and _ 7 _ spectra of the upper atmosphere of mars @xcite . 
 in addition , we identify emission from  1335 , blended with the ( 9,1 ) co fourth positive band at 1339  , indicating the presence of c@xmath21 in the ionospheres of venus and mars . 
 it is interesting to compare the ratio of these emissions between venus and mars . from table 
 [ tab1 ] we find that for all of the co bands and the atomic carbon emissions this ratio is @xmath22 , whereas the ratio of solar flux is 5.3 . 
 this had been previously noted by @xcite , and reflects the lower co to  mixing ratio on mars compared to that on venus . 
 emissions from co shortward of lyman-@xmath7 appear in the form of the hopfield - birge bands @xmath4 
 @xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1088   and @xmath3 
 @xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1151  . 
 the @xmath6 band is blended with emission from @xmath231152 . 
 the intensities of these bands are not consistent with optically thin emission . 
 since no other bands of these systems were detected a scenario of resonant scattering was assumed . 
 the band is scattered from a column of co defined by the optical thickness due to pure absorption by co@xmath24 : @xmath25 and computed using the number densities of the venus international reference atmosphere ( vira ) model @xcite and the model of @xcite for mars , with co@xmath24 absorption coefficients taken from @xcite .    to test the applicability of these atmospheric profiles to modeling the co emission , 
 we compared the column density derived from the ( 14,3 ) band at 1316   of the fourth positive system ( @xmath1   @xmath2 ) and that derived using the above relationship . 
 the brightness of the ( 14,3 ) band ( in rayleighs ) in the optically thin limit is @xmath26 and measured to be @xmath27 r in the venus spectrum . 
 the g - factor for  absorption in the ( 14,0 ) band was evaluated using the oscillator strength recommended by @xcite , @xmath28 , based on their recent work and the work of @xcite and @xcite , together with the solar  line profile from @xcite normalized to uars / solstice measurements of the solar  flux @xcite made at the time of the _ 
 astro-2 _ mission . 
 branching ratios were taken from @xcite . 
 we thus derive a co column density of @xmath29 @xmath30 , whereas the vira model predicts a column of @xmath31 @xmath30 . 
 the close agreement , considering the uncertainty in all of the parameters involved in the g - factor calculation , supports our use of these model atmospheres .    following the treatment of @xcite , a theoretical curve - of - growth 
 was calculated using the rates of emission from the excited electronic state of each rovibrational transition to determine the expected omnidirectional brightness , @xmath32 , in rayleighs . 
 the equivalent width ( @xmath33 ) of the band is then defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the incident solar flux determined from hut observations of the moon and the lunar albedo as given by @xcite . to compute the curve - of - growth 
 , we used a density weighted temperature average to characterize both the kinetic and rotational temperatures . including transitions through rotational quantum number @xmath36 , we produced curves - of - growth for both venusian and martian @xmath37 ( 0,0 ) emissions as shown in figure  [ cog ] . 
 the curves appear as bands with the upper edge corresponding to an oscillator strength of @xmath38 @xcite as recommended by @xcite , and the lower to @xmath39 @xcite . 
 the emissions appear to be consistent with resonant scattering from the upper atmospheres of both planets . as with the @xmath40 bands , 
 the observed ratio of the emissions between venus and mars is @xmath41 , whereas the ratio of the solar flux is 5.3 . 
 this difference reflects the lower co mixing ratio on mars as well as a reduced thermospheric temperature at @xmath42 . 
 curves of growth for @xmath43 ( 0,0 ) ( @xmath44 , @xcite ) were determined in the same manner as for @xmath37 ( 0,0 ) and the equivalent width corresponding to the appropriate column density was used to calculate an expected @xmath45 and @xmath46 r of emission from venus and mars respectively . subtracting these from the total observed emission results in @xmath231152 emission of about @xmath47 r for venus and @xmath48 r for mars , 
 most likely due to direct electron impact excitation of atomic oxygen . 
 argon emission at 1048 and 1066   is detected only in the spectrum of mars ( fig . 
 [ spectm ] ) . 
 the upper limits for venus are consistent with the known argon mixing ratio of @xmath49 ppm . 
 note that  1066 appears brighter than  1048 , even though the fluorescence efficiency of the 1048   line is 3.5 times higher than that of the 1066   line . 
 this is the result of the higher  absorption cross - section at 1048  . using the approach of @xcite 
 , we find an argon mixing ratio of 0.016 and 0.021 , from the brightness of the 1048 and 1066   lines , respectively . 
 considering the uncertainties in both the data and the fluorescence efficiencies , this result is in good agreement with the known value of 0.016 for mars @xcite . 
 the  multiplets near 867   are not detected on either mars or venus . 
 figure  [ spectv2 ] also shows the presence of  584 in second order at 1168   in the spectrum of venus . 
 the second order effective area of hut was only @xmath50 @xmath51 , compared to the peak first order effective area of 25 @xmath51 near 1150   @xcite , so that the derived brightness has a large statistical uncertainty , @xmath52 r. nevertheless , this result is consistent with prior measurements of  emission from _ venera _ and _ 
 galileo_.      shortward of lyman-@xmath7 , other emission features detected include  834 ,  989 ,  lyman-@xmath8 , and  1134 and 1200 . 
 the atomic nitrogen features are identified for the first time , although , as above ,  1134 appears to be present in the _ galileo _ euv spectrum of venus . 
 the disk brightnesses for both venus and mars are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . 
 while there are many weak features present in the spectrum of venus between 840 and 1000  , most of these are of terrestrial origin , primarily of atomic and singly ionized nitrogen , and the contributions from venus are at least an order of magnitude lower than those reported by @xcite from a sounding rocket observation .      table  [ tab2 ] gives a comparison of the hut measurements of the disk of venus with those reported from _ 
 venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ @xcite and , more recently , _ 
 the _ galileo _ flyby of venus was in february 1990 , during solar maximum , while the hut observations in march 1995 were at a time approaching solar minimum . 
 this is reflected in the roughly factor of two difference between the two sets of data , which must be considered excellent agreement . 
 venera 11/12 _ measurements were made in december 1978 , also approaching solar maximum . 
 thus , a similar argument accounts for the difference in  and  brightnesses between hut and _ venera_. however , it appears that the _ venera _ channels at wavelengths longward of 1500   were severely contaminated by scattered light . 
 we have obtained far - ultraviolet spectra of venus and mars in the range 820    1840    at @xmath04   resolution with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) during the _ astro-2 _ mission in march 1995 . 
 the spectra of both planets are rich in co band emission , some of the systems being identified for the first time , together with strong  and  multiplets . 
 resonance fluorescence is identified as the dominant source of the co emission . 
 atomic nitrogen emissions are also identified in the spectrum of venus , while the  doublet is seen only in the spectrum of mars . 
 these spectra , obtained at higher spectral resolution than was possible from earlier fly - by and orbiting missions to these planets , elucidates and extends the earlier spectroscopic measurements and should provide guidance in the interpretation of the far - ultraviolet spectra obtained during the recent _ cassini _ fly - by of venus @xcite . 
 it is a pleasure to thank the spacelab operations support group at marshall space flight center for their support during the _ astro-2 _ mission . 
 we also thank our many colleagues at the johns hopkins university and the applied physics laboratory for their contributions to the success of the hopkins ultraviolet telescope .

 + open quantum systems , i.e. , systems whose interaction with the environment can not be neglected , occur in a variety of contexts . 
 examples are quantum optics , atomic and molecular physics , and quantum computers . 
 if the time evolution of the system is approximately markovian , it can be described by a master equation of lindblad form [ 1 ] , a first order differential equation for the density operator . 
 solving the master equation is the principal purpose of the program . 
 since the state and operator classes are very general , they can be used in any physical problem involving hilbert spaces with several degrees of freedom . 
 _ method of solution _ : + by analogy with the solution of a fokker - planck equation by numerical simulation of the corresponding stochastic differential equation , a master equation can be solved by simulating the stochastic evolution of a vector in hilbert space . the correspondence between master equation and stochastic equation is not unique : there are many ways to _ unravel _ the master equation into stochastic quantum trajectories . the program implements three such unravelings , known as the `` quantum state diffusion method ( qsd ) '' [ 2 ] , the `` quantum jump method '' [ 35 ] , and the `` orthogonal jump method''[6 ] . 
 the phenomenon of phase - space localization [ 7,8 ] is exploited numerically by representing quantum states in a local moving basis obtained by applying the coherent - state displacement operator to the usual harmonic - oscillator basis , often leading to dramatic savings of computing resources . 
 _ unusual features of the program _ : + it is worth emphasizing the effortless way in which operators and states in product hilbert spaces are represented . 
 primary operators implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product hilbert spaces with arbitrary numbers of components . 
 building operators , performing arithmetic operations on operators and states , and applying operators to states is done using standard algebraic notation . 
 this program structure has been made possible by systematically implementing object - oriented programming concepts such as inheritance , concepts which are not ( yet ) widely used in computational physics . 
 encapsulation of program modules makes it easy to add new basic operators , alternative unravelings of the master equation , or different integration algorithms .    _ 
 typical running time _ : + the running time depends on the complexity of the problem , the integration time , and the number of trajectories required . a typical running time for 
 a simple problem is a few minutes . 
 there is no upper limit .

 for many quantum systems of current interest it is no longer possible to neglect the interactions with the environment . 
 those so - called _ open quantum systems _ occur in a variety of contexts including quantum optics , atomic and molecular physics , and quantum computers . 
 open quantum systems can often be described by a master equation @xcite , a first - order differential equation for the density operator , in which the internal dynamics of the system is represented by the system hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is a hermitian hilbert - space operator , and the interaction with the environment is represented by one or more lindblad operators @xmath1 which are not necessarily hermitian .    by analogy with the solution of a fokker - planck equation by numerical simulation of the corresponding stochastic differential equation ( or langevin equation ) , a master equation can be solved by simulating the stochastic evolution of a vector in hilbert space . the correspondence between master equation and stochastic equation is not unique ; there are many ways to _ unravel _ the master equation into stochastic quantum trajectories . 
 the main challenge of this software project was to develop a general program flexible enough to accommodate different integration algorithms and unravelings of the master equation , as well as the vast range of possible physical systems . 
 in particular , we wanted to make it easy to add new algorithms and unravelings , and we wanted a program capable of dealing with arbitrary hamiltonian and lindblad operators in hilbert spaces with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom . 
 this task turned out to be ideal for the application of object - oriented programming . 
 we chose the c++ language both because of its wide availability and because it allowed us to use standard mathematical notation for hilbert - space operations by overloading algebraic operators like ` + ' and ` @xmath2 ' . 
 the core of the program are the c++ classes state and operator , which represent state vectors and operators in hilbert space . because of the object - oriented features of c++ , it is possible to hide the implementation details of these classes completely from the classes dealing with the simulation of quantum trajectories . 
 these implementation details need not to be known either by a user of the program who wants to choose the quantum operators defining the physical problem of interest or by a programmer who wants to add a new unraveling of the master equation to the software . 
 a welcome side effect of this encapsulation is that the state and operator classes can be used independently of the rest of the code . 
 they should prove useful in many numerical schemes involving hilbert spaces for systems with several degrees of freedom . 
 many hamiltonian and lindblad operators can be written as sums of products of simple operators acting on a single degree of freedom . 
 here is an example of a hamiltonian operator coupling a two - level atom ( with raising and lowering operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) to an electromagnetic field mode ( with annihilation and creation operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 where the parameter @xmath8 is the coupling strength . in the following code segment , 
 the atomic and field degrees of freedom are labeled 0 and 1 , respectively . 
 the hamiltonian is defined in terms of the predefined _ primary operators _ sigmaplus and annihilationoperator using standard algebraic notation . 
 the class adaptivestep is a _ stepper _ routine advancing the quantum trajectory by a single time step .    .... 
 double g = 0.5 ; sigmaplus sp(0 ) ;              // operates on the 1st degree of freedom annihilationoperator a(1 ) ;    // operates on the 2nd degree of freedom operator sm = sp.hc ( ) ;        // 
 hermitian conjugate operator ac = a.hc ( ) ; operator h = g * ( sp*a + sm*ac ) ;     // 
 hamiltonian   ... adaptivestep thestepper ( ... , h , ... ) ;   // ... denotes further arguments .... 
 the important feature illustrated by this example is that the stepper routine is passed an object of type operator without any reference to details like the number of degrees of freedom . 
 all the stepper needs to know is that operators can be added , multiplied , etc . , and that they can be applied to state vectors . 
 internally , the primary operators sigmaplus and annihilationoperator are represented as simple loops acting on a single - degree - of - freedom state vector . 
 an instance of the more general operator class is represented by a stack that indicates which primary operators are used and the operations by which they are combined . for example , the sequence of steps executed by the program when the operator @xmath0 defined above is applied to a state @xmath9 is summarized in the expression @xmath10 in which the elementary steps are applying a primary operator to a state , adding two states , and multiplying a state by a scalar . 
 it is clear from this example that a different grouping of the terms in the expression for @xmath0 could lead to inefficient code . 
 this will be discussed in sec . 
 [ secop ] . 
 an open quantum system can not be described by a hilbert - space vector @xmath11 evolving according to the schrdinger equation ; instead , the state must be described by a density operator @xmath12 whose time evolution generally does not follow any simple law . 
 fortunately it turns out that for a large class of systems the time evolution of the density operator @xmath12 is _ markovian _ to an excellent approximation , i.e. , the rate of change of @xmath12 at time @xmath13 , @xmath14 , depends only on @xmath15 , not on the value of @xmath12 at any earlier time . 
 it has been shown that under the markov approximation the density operator of any open quantum system obeys a _ 
 master equation _ of lindblad form @xcite @xmath16 +   \sum_j\left(\hat l_j\hat\rho \hat l_j^\dagger   - { 1\over2 } \hat l_j^\dagger\hat l_j\hat\rho    - { 1\over2}\hat\rho   \hat l_j^\dagger\hat l_j\right ) \ ; , \label{eqmaster}\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the system hamiltonian and the @xmath1 are the lindblad operators representing the interaction with the environment .    in many cases , 
 no analytical methods for the solution of the master equation are known ; one has to use numerical methods . 
 but even a numerical solution of the master equation can be very hard . 
 if a state requires @xmath17 basis vectors in hilbert space to represent it , the corresponding density operator will require @xmath18 real numbers ; this can often be too large for even the most powerful machines to handle , particularly if the system involves more than one degree of freedom . 
 this problem can be overcome by unraveling the density operator evolution into _ quantum trajectories _ . 
 since quantum trajectories represent the system as a state vector rather than a density operator , they often have a numerical advantage over solving the master equation directly , even though one has to average over many quantum trajectories to recover the solution of the master equation . 
 a single quantum trajectory can give an excellent , albeit qualitative , picture of a single experimental run . 
 the three unravelings of the master equation currently implemented are given by the following three nonlinear stochastic differential equation for a normalized state vector @xmath19 :    \(i ) the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) equation @xcite @xmath20 ( ii ) the quantum jump equation @xcite @xmath21 and ( iii ) the orthogonal jump equation @xcite @xmath22 the first sum in each of these equations represents the deterministic drift of the state vector due to the environment , and the second sum the random fluctuations . 
 angular brackets denote the quantum expectation @xmath23 of the operator @xmath24 in the state @xmath19 . 
 the @xmath25 are independent complex differential gaussian random variables satisfying the conditions @xmath26 where m denotes the ensemble mean . 
 the @xmath27 are independent real discrete poissonian random variables satisfying the conditions @xmath28 where the `` conditional mean '' @xmath29 is defined as the mean over all trajectories for which @xmath30 , and where @xmath31 for the quantum jump equation  ( [ eqqj ] ) and @xmath32 for the orthogonal jump equation  ( [ eqortho ] ) . 
 the density operator is given by the mean over the projectors onto the quantum states of the ensemble : @xmath33 if the pure states of the ensemble satisfy one of the quantum trajectory equations ( [ eqqsd ] ) , ( [ eqqj ] ) , or ( [ eqortho ] ) , then the density operator satisfies the master equation ( [ eqmaster ] ) : @xmath34 where we have assumed that initially the system is in a pure state @xmath35 at time @xmath36 . from this 
 it is clear that the expectation value of an operator @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 
 our c++ library can be divided roughly into three large parts :    \1 . 
 the state class and its associated friend functions . 
 a state includes as member data the number of degrees of freedom it represents , how many basis vectors are allocated for each degree of freedom , the physical type of each degree of freedom , and ( of course ) the complex amplitudes of each basis vector in the total hilbert space . 
 the member functions include constructors for a number of common state types ; arithmetic functions enabling states to be added , subtracted , multiplied by scalars , and normalized ; functions relating to the efficient use of memory , so that a state can be dynamically resized ; and functions controlling the action of operators on the state . 
 there are also member data and functions relating to the moving basis algorithm , described below 
 . states ( and operators ) can be used like ordinary variables . in particular , 
 when a locally defined state ( or operator ) goes out of scope , all memory used by it is properly returned to the system ; the user of the program need not worry about memory allocation and deallocation as this is done automatically . 
 \2 . the operator class . 
 operators are defined in terms of their actions on states . 
 there is a small class of primaryoperators , whose actions on a single degree of freedom are given by pre - defined functions . 
 more complex operators are defined in terms of these primaryoperators ; they can be added , multiplied , multiplied by scalars or time - dependent functions , conjugated , or raised to powers . 
 an operator s member data includes a number of dynamically allocated stacks which indicate which primaryoperators are used , and the operations by which they are combined . 
 arithmetic operations on operators are then defined by operations on these stacks . 
 \3 . the trajectory class and associated classes . 
 these encode the numerical algorithms for solving the quantum trajectory equations and generating output , with associated integration routines , random number generators , and other utilities . 
 several different integration algorithms are currently included , including second- and fourth - order runge - kutta and cash - karp runge - kutta with adaptive time steps @xcite . 
 these algorithms are used to solve the deterministic part of the quantum trajectory equations ( [ eqqsd ] ) , ( [ eqqj ] ) , and ( [ eqortho ] ) . 
 the stochastic terms are solved using first - order euler integration . 
 the implementation of more sophisticated stochastic integration methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is straightforward . note that it is only in this part of the program that there is any reference at all to the details of quantum unravelings . 
 the operator and state classes are very general . 
 these three parts are roughly equal in size , but quite different in internal structure . 
 the state class is a single monolithic c++ class with associated functions ; the operator class is a parent class with numerous descendent classes representing the different primaryoperators . 
 the numerical integration classes are independent of the details of state and operator , and of each other . because of the object - oriented nature of c++ , these three groups need know very little about each other s internal workings . 
 the following more detailed discussion is not exhaustive ; a complete description of the code can be found in the extensively commented # include files , particularly in state.h , operator.h , and traject.h . 
 we represent a state @xmath9 with a single degree of freedom by an array of @xmath39 complex amplitudes @xmath40 in a given basis @xmath41 : @xmath42 the choice of basis vectors depends on the physical type of the system . for field modes , 
 we use fock states @xmath43 ; for spins ( @xmath44 ) , we use @xmath45 eigenstates @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; for @xmath39-level atoms , we use energy levels @xmath48 . other types , e.g. , molecules or higher spins , can be added easily . 
 of course , a true field mode has an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . 
 the state class represents fields by a finite number of basis states , which should be taken as a truncation of the true infinite expansion .    to represent a state then requires the physical type ( currently field , spin or atom ) , the number of basis vectors @xmath39 , and an array of @xmath39 complex amplitudes . 
 the state class contains constructors for many typical situations . 
 for instance , the expression    .... state psi(2,spin ) ; ....    defines psi to be the @xmath46 state of a spin ( @xmath49 ) , and    .... complex alpha(0.2,0.3 ) ; state psi(100,alpha , field ) ; ....    defines a coherent state @xmath50 with @xmath51 truncated to @xmath52 basis states . 
 arithmetic operations for states are defined internally as operations on the complex amplitudes . in the following code examples , 
 the state @xmath53 is formed from the fock states @xmath54 and @xmath55 , added to @xmath56 , and then renormalized ; finally , the inner product @xmath57 is evaluated . here 
 @xmath58 basis states are more than sufficient to represent all states without any truncation .    .... state psi1(10,0,field ) ; state psi2(10,3,field ) ; state psi3 = 0.5*psi1 - psi2 ; psi1 + = psi3 ; psi3.normalize ( ) ; complex z = psi2*psi3 ; ....    the expression psi1+=psi3 is superior to the alternative psi1=psi1+psi3 because it avoids the creation of temporary state objects , which is an important consideration in high - dimensional hilbert spaces .      a general way of representing operators is as @xmath59 complex matrices acting on vectors in @xmath39-dimensional hilbert space . for large @xmath39 , however , this can be very inefficient , as these matrices become very large , and applying them to states requires @xmath60 operations . 
 fortunately , most of the operators of interest in quantum systems are _ sparse _ , consisting of sums and products of a few primary operators . for fields , 
 such primary operators are annihilation and creation operators @xmath5 and @xmath61 and position and momentum operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; for spins , the primary operators are the pauli matrices @xmath64 ; for atoms , we have the transition operators @xmath65 .    in the program , these primary operators are implemented as simple classes , as illustrated for the spin operator @xmath3 in the following code section . 
 .... class sigmaplus : public primaryoperator { public :    sigmaplus ( ) : primaryoperator(0,spin ) { } ;    sigmaplus(int freedom ) : primaryoperator(freedom , spin ) { } ;    virtual void applyto(state&,int , double ) ; } ; void sigmaplus::applyto(state & v , int hc , double ) {    switch ( hc ) {    case no_hc :      v[1 ] = v[0 ] ; v[0 ] = 0 ; break ;    case hc :      v[0 ] = v[1 ] ; v[1 ] = 0 ; break ;     } } ....    the sigmaplus class is derived from the abstract class primaryoperator which serves as an interface to the different special classes like sigmaplus . apart from the two constructors , the class contains only the method applyto . 
 the three arguments of applyto are a single - degree of freedom state , an integer switch determining whether to apply @xmath3 or its hermitian conjugate , and a double argument specifying the time for time - dependent operators , which is not used here . 
 the program represents _ composite operators _ , i.e. , sums and products of primary operators , by stacks containing pointers to primary operators as illustrated in fig . 
 [ figstack ] . 
 those stacks are the principal member data of the operator class , which is the parent class of primaryoperator and therefore of all special classes derived from primaryoperator . for a primary operator like sigmaplus , 
 the stack consists just of the pointer to this , which points to the primary operator itself . 
 figure  [ figinherit ] shows the hierarchy of operator classes .    the example stack in box 3 in fig . 
 [ figstack ] is generated by the code segment    .... operator o1 = a + b ; operator o2 = ( 3 * c ) * d ; operator o3 = 01 - 02 ; ....    where a , b , c , d are assumed to be primary operators defined earlier in the program . 
 the example illustrates how addition , subtraction , and multiplication of operators is implemented in terms of operations on the stack . 
 further operations defined for operators include hermitian conjugation and raising to an integer power . 
 the c++ inheritance mechanism ensures that all these operations are also defined for the derived primary - operator classes like sigmaplus .    to apply an operator to a state 
 , the ` ' operator can be used as in the following example , where psi is a state and o3 is defined above :    .... state psi1 = o3 * psi ; ....    internally , this is implemented as a recursive evaluation of the stack . the order in which the primary operators are applied in the example 
 can be inferred from the parentheses in @xmath66 the program keeps the number of operations and the number of temporary states it creates to a minimum . 
 some care has to be exercised , however , to avoid an inefficient evaluation order . 
 e.g. , in the code segment    .... double x=1.5 ; sigmaplus sp ; state psi1 = 2.0*x*sp*psi ; ....    the state sp*psi is first multiplied by 1.5 , then by 2.0 , whereas in    .... 
 double x=1.5 ; sigmaplus sp ; state psi1 = ( 2.0*x)*sp*psi ; ....    there is only one multiplication by 3.0 . 
 the creation of unnecessary temporary states can be avoided by applying operators to states using the ` = ' operator as in    .... sigmaplus sp ; state psi(2,spin ) ; psi * = sp ; ....    when this code segment is executed , no temporary states are created , in contrast to the otherwise equivalent code segment    .... sigmaplus sp ;    state psi(2,spin ) ; psi = sp*psi ; ....    a detailed explanation of the stack and the recursive evaluation procedure can be found in the extensively commented file operator.cc . 
 a quantum system with @xmath67 degrees of freedom can be represented in a product hilbert space @xmath68 . 
 we assume that there is a finite , perhaps truncated , product basis @xmath69 . 
 any state @xmath70 can then be written in the form @xmath71 requiring a total of @xmath72 basis vectors . 
 to represent a state with multiple degrees of freedom , the state class contains as member data the number of freedoms @xmath67 , an array of @xmath67 physical types , an array of @xmath67 subspace dimensions @xmath73 , and an array of @xmath74 amplitudes @xmath75 . 
 product states can be initialized by passing a list of single - degree - of - freedom states to the appropriate state constructor . 
 this is illustrated in the following example , where the state @xmath76 is assigned to psiini :    .... state phi1(50,field ) ; state phi2(50,field ) ; state phi3(2,spin ) ; state statelist[3 ] = { phi1 , phi2 , phi3 } ; state psiini(3,statelist ) ; ....    entangled states can be constructed by adding several product states or by explicitly initializing the array of amplitudes @xmath75 . 
 operators acting on multiple degrees of freedom are represented as sums and products of primary operators each acting on a single degree of freedom . 
 take the example of a primary operator @xmath77 acting on the first degree of freedom . 
 it can be rewritten as the operator @xmath78 on the product hilbert space , where @xmath79 is the identity operator acting on all the other degrees of freedom . 
 we can write any state @xmath9 as @xmath80 the action of @xmath78 on @xmath9 is therefore given by the action of @xmath77 on the first degree of freedom inside a hierarchy of loops over all the other degrees of freedom : @xmath81 in the program , the loops are unfolded into one big loop if the primary operator acts on the first or last degree of freedom ; otherwise the loops are unfolded into two loops , an `` inner '' and an `` outer '' loop .    to define , e.g. , a primary sigmaplus operator acting on the @xmath82rd degree of freedom , the constructor has to be called with the argument @xmath83 :    .... sigmaplus sp(2 ) ; ....    the operator class is virtually unaffected by the complications arising from multiple degrees of freedom ( see fig . 
 [ figmultiple ] ) . whenever an operator is applied to a state psi 
 , the recursive evaluation of the operator stack will eventually come across a pointer to some primary operator b acting on a particular freedom . at that stage 
 , the pointer to b will be passed to the method psi.apply ( ) of the state class , which controls the loops over all the other degrees of freedom . 
 each time the loop is executed , the state class passes a single - degree - of - freedom state to the method b.applyto ( ) of the primary operator b. the complex amplitudes of this single - freedom state are typically stored at widely spaced locations in the array of complex amplitudes @xmath75 , but this fact is completely hidden from the primary operator b.    this way of organizing the program has great advantages . 
 most importantly , all the implementation details of multiple - freedom states are hidden from the operator class . 
 apart from leading to a transparent program , this makes adding new primary operators very easy , as was seen in sec . 
 [ secop ] . 
 the definition of the primary - operator class sigmaplus given there is used without modification in the multiple - freedom case . 
 our class library realizes its full potential when all operators are sums and products of a few simple primary operators . 
 although this situation is extremely common in many fields , there are important exceptions like the coulomb potential . while the program could be adapted to implement such a case , some of its unique features would be lost in the process .    for efficiency 
 , the state class distinguishes internally between single - freedom and multiple - freedom states ; many actions are more efficient for a single degree of freedom . 
 this distinction , however , is completely transparent . 
 the user need distinguish between the two only when constructing the initial state . 
 in quantum - trajectory simulations , one often encounters field states that are well _ localized _ in phase space . in cases with strong localization , it is often possible to reduce drastically the number @xmath39 of basis states needed by continually changing the basis . 
 if a state is localized about a point @xmath84 in phase space far from the origin , it requires many number states @xmath43 to represent it . 
 but relatively few displaced number states ( or _ excited coherent states _ ) @xmath85 , are needed , with corresponding savings in computer storage space and computation time . 
 the operator @xmath86 is the usual coherent state displacement operator @xcite , @xmath87 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the position and momentum operators . 
 the separation of the representation into a classical part @xmath84 and a quantum part @xmath88 is called the _ moving basis _ 
 @xcite or , as in @xcite , the _ 
 mixed _ representation . 
 to represent a state of type field in the moving basis requires to store the complex center of coordinates @xmath89 in addition to the complex amplitudes . 
 a multiple - freedom state in the moving basis with several freedoms of type field requires an array of centers of coordinates .    implementing 
 the moving basis algorithm is straightforward . 
 suppose that at time @xmath90 the state @xmath91 is represented in the basis @xmath92 , centered at @xmath93 then after one discrete time step , the expectations in this basis shift to @xmath94 the computational advantage of a small number of basis states is then retained by changing the representation to the shifted basis @xmath95 centered at @xmath96 and @xmath97 . 
 this shift in the origin of the basis represents the elementary single step of the moving basis . 
 the components of @xmath98 can be computed using the expressions given above . 
 the computing time needed for the basis shift is of the same order of magnitude as for computing a single discrete time step of one of the quantum trajectory equations . shifting the basis once every discrete time step could therefore double the computing time , depending on the complexity of the hamiltonian and the number of degrees of freedom . on the other hand 
 , the reduced number of basis vectors needed to represent states in the moving basis can lead to savings far bigger than a factor of 2 .    in the example of second harmonic generation discussed in @xcite , two modes of the electromagnetic field interact . using the moving basis 
 reduces the number of basis vectors needed by a factor of 100 in each mode . 
 the total number of basis vectors needed is thus reduced by a factor of 10000 , leading to reduction in computing time by a factor of roughly @xmath99 . 
 furthermore , the fixed basis would exceed the memory capacity of most computers . 
 the state class includes a variety of basis - changing methods . 
 the most important is the method    .... void movecoords ( const complex & displacement , int thefreedom ,                   double shiftaccuracy ) ; ....    which performs a relative shift of the center of coordinates @xmath89 by an amount given by the complex argument displacement . 
 the integer argument thefreedom specifies which degree of freedom is to be shifted  this degree of freedom must be of type field . 
 the double argument shiftaccuracy gives the numerical accuracy with which to make the shift . 
 the physical state is unchanged by applying movecoords ( ) , but it is represented in a new basis . 
 the method movecoords ( ) is used in the stochastic integration algorithms of the trajectory class described in sec . 
 [ sectraj ] . 
 the primary operators of type field defined in the files fieldop.h and fieldop.cc are implemented in such a way that they can handle moving - basis states as well as ordinary states . 
 the quantum trajectory equations can contain both localizing and delocalizing terms . . 
 nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian tend to spread the wave function in phase space , whereas the lindblad terms often cause it to localize . 
 accordingly , the width of the wave packets varies along a typical trajectory . 
 we use this to reduce the computing time even further by dynamically adjusting the number of basis vectors . 
 our criterion for this adjustment depends on parameters @xmath100 , the _ cutoff probability _ , and @xmath101 , the _ pad size _ , which represents the number of boundary basis states that are checked for significant probability . 
 we require the total probability of the top @xmath101 states to be no greater than @xmath102 , increasing or decreasing the number of states actually used accordingly , as the integration proceeds along the quantum trajectory . 
 the method of the state class used to adjust the basis size is    .... void adjustcutoff(int thefreedom , double epsilon , int padsize ) ; ....    where the arguments specify the degree of freedom to be adjusted , the cutoff probability @xmath102 , and the pad size @xmath101 , respectively .    like the basis - changing methods discussed above , the method adjustcutoff ( ) is typically only used inside integration routines of the trajectory class . 
 those methods will not normally be called from a top - level program , so the user need not be concerned by them . 
 the trajectory class and its associated classes , defined in the files traject.h and 
 traject.cc , implement the integration of the quantum trajectory equations  ( [ eqqsd ] ) , ( [ eqqj ] ) , and ( [ eqortho ] ) . at the heart of this part of the code 
 is the abstract class integrationstep which serves as an interface for the specific stepper classes implementing single integration steps of lenght @xmath103 . 
 the stepper classes derived from the class integrationstep include the class order4step for a single 4-th order runge - kutta step of the qsd equation  ( [ eqqsd ] ) as well as a group of classes using adaptive cash - karp runge - kutta time steps : the class adaptivestep for a time step of total length @xmath103 of the qsd equation  ( [ eqqsd ] ) , the class adaptivejump for a time step of total length @xmath103 of the quantum jump equation  ( [ eqqj ] ) , and the class adaptiveorthojump for a time step of total length @xmath103 of the orthogonal jump equation  ( [ eqortho ] ) . 
 all those classes use a single first order euler integration step of length @xmath103 for the stochastic part . 
 due to the modular structure of the class library , it is straightforward to add more sophisticated stochastic integration methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    to initialize a stepper , including 
 all temporary memory needed for the integration algorithm , all one has to do is call the appropriate constructor as in the code segment    .... state psiini(2,spin ) ; sigmaplus sp ; operator h = sp + sp.hc ( ) ; int nl = 1 ; operator l[nl ] = { 0.1*sp.hc ( ) } adaptivestep stepper(psiini , h , nl , l ) ; ....    a less trivial example can be found in the sample program in sec . 
 [ secsample ] . 
 entire quantum trajectories are computed by repeatedly calling a stepper from within the trajectory class . 
 a trajectory is initialized as in the following example which is taken from the sample program below :    .... double dt=0.01 ;     // 
 basic time step passed to the stepper acg gen(38388389 ) ; // 
 random number generator defined in acg.h complexnormal rndm(&gen ) ;                      // 
 gaussian random numbers defined in cmplxran.h trajectory traj(psiini , dt , stepper , & rndm ) ; ....    the trajectory class comprises two methods to launch the simulation , compute expectation values of operators of interest , and produce output . 
 the use of the method plotexp ( ) , designed to simulate a single trajectory , is explained in sec . 
 [ secsample ] . 
 the method sumexp ( ) , which is very similar to plotexp ( ) , can be used to compute the mean expectation values of operators averaged over many trajectories . 
 in this section , we illustrate the main features of the class library in a complete example program which can be used as a template . 
 the example program computes expectation values for a single trajectory of the quantum state diffusion equation ( [ eqqsd ] ) ; to compute means over many trajectories , one simply replaces the call to traj.plotexp ( ) in the template by a call to traj.sumexp ( ) . the system has three degrees of freedom : two nonlinearly coupled field modes described by annihilation operators @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and a spin described by raising and lowering operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 . 
 the hamiltonian in the interaction picture is @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the strength of an external pump field , @xmath108 is the strength of the nonlinear interaction , @xmath109 is the detuning between the frequency of the field mode @xmath105 and the spin transition frequency , and @xmath110 is the strength of the coupling of the spin to the field mode @xmath105 . 
 the lindblad operators @xmath111 describe dissipation of the field modes and the spin with coefficients @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively . 
 the trajectory s initial state is the product state @xmath115 . 
 the integration step - size is dt=0.01 and the total integration time is 500*dt = 5 . 
 the integration stepper adaptivestep implements a single time step of length dt of the qsd equation  ( [ eqqsd ] ) using the cash - karp runge - kutta algorithm with adaptive time steps @xcite for the deterministic part and first - order euler integration for the stochastic part .    at times that are integer multiples of 50*dt = 0.5 , 
 the expectation values of the operators specified in the array outlist are computed and written to the files specified in the array flist . 
 e.g. , the first element of outlist is the operator @xmath116 . at times 
 @xmath117 , the method plotexp computes the expectation values @xmath118 and @xmath119 and writes @xmath13 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 to the file x1.out . 
 in addition , each time a set of expectation values is computed , the program writes 7 numbers to standard output ( see the sample output below ) : the time @xmath13 , 4 expectation values determined by the integer array pipe , the number of basis states used , and the number of adaptive steps taken . 
 the integers in the array pipe correspond to the columns in the output files containing expectation values ( i.e. , columns 2 through 5 of each output file ) . in the present example , expectation values are computed for the 5 operators @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath105 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , which are written to 5 output files with numbered columns 1 through 20 . according to the expression int pipe[]=\{1,5,13,17 } , 
 the expectation values written to standard output are @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . 
 the moving basis is used for both field degrees of freedom . 
 the basis size is dynamically adjusted with a cutoff probability @xmath132 and a pad size @xmath133 . 
 the sample output below shows how the basis size changes with time . 
 initially , @xmath134 states are allocated , but at time @xmath135 , only 18 states are needed . 
 subsequently , the basis size fluctuates around a typical size of 70 states .

38,"the past several years have seen a rapid and exciting increase in the amount of information available concerning the physical properties of extrasolar planets . in particular , 
 the class of short orbital period planets , known informally as ` hot jupiters ' , has begun to yield information through a variety of observational channels . 
 the discovery of systems in which the orbital plane is almost edge - on to the line of sight has resulted in the detection of planetary transits ( charbonneau et al . 
 2000 ; henry et al . 
 2000 ; bouchy et al . 
 optical and ultraviolet photometry and spectroscopy of such systems can yield information about the absorbative properties of the planet atmosphere ( brown et al . 
 2001 ; charbonneau et al . 
 2002 ; vidal - madjar et al . 2003 ; vidal - madjar et al . 2004 ) . 
 in addition , the unparalleled capabilities of the spitzer space telescope has allowed the detection of thermal infrared emission ( charbonneau et al . 
 2005 ; deming et al . 
 2005 , deming et al . 
 2006 ; grillmair et al . 
 2007 ; richardson et al . 2007 ) during secondary eclipses as well as the measurement of phase curves for non - transitting systems ( harrington et al . 
 2006 ) .    this flurry of observational activity has spurred a similar level of activity on the theoretical front , with several independent models being used to infer the physical properties of the planets from the observations ( seager & sasselov 2000 ; barman , hauschildt & allard 2001 ; cho et al . 
 2003 ; menou et al 2003 ; sudarsky , burrows & hubeny 2003 ; burrows , hubeny & sudarsky 2005 ; dyudina et al . 2005 ; cooper & showman 2005 ; seager et al . 2005 ; barman , hauschildt & allard 2005 ; fortney et al . 
 2005 ; fortney 2005 ; burrows , sudarsky & hubeny 2006 ; cooper & showman 2006 ; fortney et al . 2006 ; langton & laughlin 2007 ) . 
 the resulting inferences are not always entirely in agreement . 
 as an example , consider each group s response to the first detection of secondary eclipses . 
 burrows et al . 
 ( 2005 ) concluded that the redistribution of energy from the substellar to the antistellar face of the planet was weak . on the other hand , barman , hauschildt & allard ( 2005 ) , as well as fortney et al . 
 ( 2005 ) , concluded that the redistribution was strong , while the opinion of seager et al . 
 ( 2005 ) fell somewhere in between . 
 similarly , predictions for the effects of atmospheric fluid motions on the emergent intensity pattern differ substantially from group to group ( cho et al . 
 2003 ; cooper & showman 2006 ; langton & laughlin 2007 ) . 
 this diversity of opinion is hardly surprising , given the complexity of the problem . 
 the study of hot jupiter atmospheres requires that we understand the atmospheric chemistry , radiative transfer and hydrodynamics of the planetary atmosphere . 
 these are affected by the thermal structure and evolution of the planet , by the effects of photochemistry induced by ultraviolet light from the star , the possible existence and behaviour of atmospheric condensates , whether they form clouds , and whether ( or if ) energy is redistributed across the surface of the planet or reradiated in situ . 
 furthermore , there are a variety of different observational probes , each of which provides information but in ways that differ , sometimes subtly , from other methods . 
 the complexity of the coupled radiative transfer , chemical equilibrium and atmospheric flow models also restrict somewhat the flexibility of the models in providing the true qualitative or geometric information necessary to develop a real understanding of what the observations are telling us .    the overall intent in the pages 
 to follow is pedagogical 
 . clearly , detailed model atmospheres are necessary to fully interpret the emerging observations 
 . however , simplified models that focus on key physical elements can be useful to try and develop a qualitative understanding of what elements of the model each of the various extant observations is actually probing . to do this , we construct a sequence of analytic and semi - analytic toy models . 
 these models are chosen to be simple enough to be transparent while still capturing the qualitative features of the more detailed models . 
 the hope is that one can use this approach to tailor our interpretations of the more detailed calculations to reach a proper synthesis between theory and the different observations that we have at our disposal . in   [ nada ] 
 we review our simplest model , based on a variation of the grey atmosphere model . 
 in this first case we will assume no redistribution of energy across the face of the planet . in 
 [ apply ] we then examine how the various available observations relate to the underlying structure of the model . in 
 [ finally ] we then introduce the physics of energy redistribution into the model and examine how this affects the observations in   [ moreapps ] . 
 finally , in   [ finis ] , we place our models within the context of both observations and more detailed models in the literature , and examine possible implications for future generations of models . 
 to begin , we briefly review the basic steps in calculating the grey atmosphere model . 
 these may be found in almost any textbook on radiative transfer ( e.g. mihalas 1978 ) but it is worth reviewing them again as we will need to employ some subtle variations in subsequent sections . in doing 
 so we will also derive a simple model which gives an explicit analytic description of the current philosophy in the literature for treating this situation . 
 this will serve as a useful baseline for comparison in later sections .      in the grey approximation , we work with a frequency - integrated version of the radiative transfer equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the specific intensity , and @xmath2 is the source function . 
 @xmath1 is a function of optical depth @xmath3 and angle cosine ( relative to the normal direction ) @xmath4 . in local thermodynamic equilibrium , where the optical depth is due to absorption rather than scattering , @xmath5 , the frequency - integrated planck function . 
 integration over angle yields the equation for flux conservation , which is satisfied as long as the conditions for radiative equilibrium are met , i.e. @xmath6 . 
 @xmath7 is the mean intensity , the zeroth moment of @xmath1 over angle . 
 the first moment of equation  ( [ radtrans ] ) yields @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the first and second moments of @xmath1 . at this point 
 , we adopt the eddington approximation , assuming that @xmath11 . 
 this results in the equation @xmath12 which yields a solution for @xmath13 , @xmath14 . 
 the constant @xmath15 is determined from equation  ( [ firmom ] ) and the lower boundary condition on the flux @xmath16 entering the atmosphere from below . in the terminology of mihalas ( 1978 ) , @xmath17 is the `` astrophysical flux '' and @xmath9 is the `` eddington flux '' . since @xmath18 , one can also determine @xmath1 from the formal solution to the first order differential equation  ( [ radtrans ] ) @xmath19 e^{-t/\mu } \frac{dt}{\mu } = j_0 + \frac{3}{4 } f_{int } \mu.\ ] ] the final act is to determine the constant @xmath20 by the calculation of the emergent flux at the surface ( @xmath21 ) from the expression for @xmath1 and the condition that it must equal @xmath22 @xmath23 for most astronomical applications , the second term here is set to zero as it represents the contribution from rays directed inward at the surface , and most stars are not subject to any significant level of irradiation . 
 however , in the case of hot jupiters , this particular term is of great importance as it introduces the irradiation from the parent star into the problem . 
 the simple approximation used most often in the literature is uniform irradiation i.e. @xmath24 for @xmath25 , although the reality of the situation is that all the incoming rays are coming from a single direction , that of the star . 
 nevertheless , if we proceed with the uniform irradiation approximation , we can use this to determine @xmath20 and derive the final solution for the specific intensity @xmath26 where we have included a dilution factor @xmath27 in the spirit of the more sophisticated modellers . 
 this is how the detailed models attempt to account for the difference between the true situation and the isotropic irradiation assumption . 
 because of the computation expense involved , these models are still calculated in the one dimensional case , but the incoming radiation is ` diluted ' by @xmath27 in order to approximately mimic the effect of averaging over the true non - uniform irradiation pattern .    an important point to note 
 is that the _ net flux _ through any given point in the model atmosphere is still only the internally generated @xmath22 , since no energy from the irradiation is permanently absorbed by the planet in this baseline model 
 it is all reradiated . however , the flux the observer sees is the sum total of all flux travelling outwards from the planetary surface , and so includes the contribution of reradiated stellar light . in the case of a secondary eclipse , this is radiated from the surface in the direction of the star . 
 ( for this simple model the distinction is moot , but it will become important in subsequent sections ) . 
 @xmath28    the traditional assumption found in the literature has been to adopt a value of @xmath29 to represent the case of no energy redistribution over the surface of the planet . in this case 
 the dilution is meant to represent the fact that the incoming flux is absorbed from plane parallel rays spread over over a surface @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the planet radius ) but is reradiated isotropically from each point on the irradiated hemisphere and so the energy is emitted into a solid angle of @xmath32 . if the energy is redistributed uniformly over the entire planet by fluid motions / winds and only then reradiated , then the angle is @xmath33 and the dilution factor is @xmath34 . 
 the previous section gave an explicit example for how irradiated planets are currently treated using a one - dimensional model and a dilution factor . 
 however , we can adapt this formalism easily to treat the geometry of the no - redistribution model properly .    the first improvement to make is to dispense with the assumption of an isotropic irradiation . 
 consider instead the irradiation is due to a mono - directional beam . 
 the discussion here is illustrative and this point will be addressed further when we come to the actual model we will use . ] , so that @xmath35 for @xmath25 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the poloidal and toroidal co - ordinates for a given point on the planetary surface . 
 furthermore , we can now choose @xmath38 & @xmath39 so that , for each point on the planet s substellar hemisphere , the irradiating beam is coming from the direction of the star . to achieve this 
 , we simply note that @xmath40 is the angle cosine between the present location and the substellar point . 
 to determine the constant @xmath20 in this case , we need to match to the outgoing flux @xmath41 . with this change , 
 equation  ( [ solution1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath42 we omit @xmath27 in this expression because it is no longer needed . 
 this is now a solution that varies across the surface of the irradiated planet , as determined by the local angle of incidence of the irradiation . to obtain the flux we actually observe 
 , we simply integrate over @xmath36 and @xmath37 . 
 evaluating the integral at full phase ( secondary eclipse ) , we find @xmath43 it is of interest to note that , in order to make equation  ( [ supcon1 ] ) match this expression , we require @xmath44 , rather than the value @xmath45 that is normally quoted . 
 this is because our new model does not have a uniform distribution of flux over the surface of the planet  rather , it is hotter near the substellar point because that is where the irradiation is the most intense . 
 thus , the uniform dilution approximation underestimates the secondary eclipse flux . 
 we can easily confirm global energy conservation in this model . with the monodirectional beam of irradiation 
 , the total flux impinging on the surface of the planet is @xmath46 using equation  ( [ solution2 ] ) to calculate the total emitted flux returns the same value . in the case of the isotropic irradiation model , the total flux emitted from the planet may be expressed as @xmath47 if we use equation  ( [ solution1 ] ) . 
 the equality of this with @xmath48 is how we arrive at the value @xmath29 . 
 thus , our very first conclusion , even from a relatively simple model , is that the detailed models in the literature often dilute even their ` no - redistribution ' models too much . 
 models for secondary eclipses should not be too democratically averaged over the surface of the planet , but should be weighted in favour of the hotter substellar point . 
 this is in agreement with a similar comparison performed by barman , hauschildt & allard ( 2005 ) , who compared two dimensional no redistribution models with the same one dimensional models for @xmath29 ( their `` @xmath49 '' is equivalent to our @xmath27 ) . 
 we wish to improve our toy model still further , because there is an important piece of physics still missing . 
 the wavelengths of the incoming stellar photons are very different from those of the reradiated photons . 
 this is a consequence of the very different temperatures and hence spectral energy distributions of the star and the planet . 
 the result is that the opacities and hence optical depths can be very different for the energy flow in the optical and infrared wavelength regimes . 
 thus , we will modify our model such that we treat the absorption of stellar irradiation 
 seperately and with a different optical depth than we do the subsequent reradiation .    in order to do this , let us treat the grey version of the radiative transfer equation in a ` two - stream ' fashion , with two specific intensities , @xmath50 to describe the optical radiation , and @xmath51 to describe the infrared radiation . 
 this allows us to treat the two streams with different opacities and emissivities . in this limit 
 , we have two equations of radiative transfer , corresponding to the optical and infra - red respectively . 
 @xmath52 where we have set @xmath53 , the source function in the optical , to zero , since we assume the planet has negligible emissivity in the optical . 
 furthermore , the constraint of radiative equilibrium requires that all the energy removed from the beam ( in both wavelength regimes ) is replaced by the infrared source function @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the appropriate opacities and mean intensities is a constant . ] . 
 thus our radiative equilibrium expression is slightly modified from the usual form , @xmath58    within this approximation , the first moment equations become @xmath59 using equation  ( [ radeq ] ) , and @xmath60 , we can combine these equations into @xmath61 this amounts to the rather obvious statement that all the flux removed from the incoming beam in the optical must emerge in the infrared beam . 
 the attenuation of the incident beam is described by @xmath62 where we have replaced @xmath63 with @xmath3 , our default optical depth scale henceforth . recall that @xmath25 , since this is an inwardly directed beam . 
 the local flux ( travelling inwards ) is @xmath64 this is the flux flowing inwards due to the irradiation . 
 we have thus a measure of how much energy is deposited at each depth . 
 we assume the energy is absorbed , thermalised and now reradiated in the infrared . 
 this is done by incorporating equation  ( [ fbeam ] ) into equation  ( [ hbeam ] ) , @xmath65 the gradient in @xmath9 is negative , because the total energy flux carried outwards by the radiation field is less as one gets deeper into the planet . 
 we once again make the eddington approximation . 
 this is a poor one for a monodirectional beam , but we note that the approximation is only applied here to the reradiation field . 
 once the energy is thermalised and included in the reradiation energy flow , which is much more isotropically distributed , this is a more reasonable approximation . 
 thus we obtain the integrable equation @xmath66 which can be integrated to yield @xmath67    the integration constant @xmath15 is determined , as before , by the internal flux emerging from the planet ( @xmath68 ) . to determine the other constant , we need to ensure the total flux emerging at the top of the atmosphere 
 reflects the appropriate sum of internal and absorbed flux . to that end 
 , we calculate the specific intensity as a function of angle at the surface @xmath69    one may then integrate this over angle to determine the total flux emerging from the surface @xmath70    this should match the sum of the internal radiation and flux incident on the top of the atmosphere from the star , @xmath41 , so that the final expression for the emergent specific intensity is @xmath71 . \label{final_solution}\ ] ] this expression now will allow us to calculate the emergent radiation field in a manner appropriate to any particular observation geometry , given a particular choice of observer orientation and orbital phase . the angle @xmath40 measures the angle for each point on the surface relative to the illuminating star , while @xmath4 measures the angle relative to the observer 
 the parameter @xmath22 is the internal heat flux emerging from the planet itself , while @xmath72 encodes the strength of the irradiation . 
 the ratio of @xmath72 relative to @xmath22 will determine whether the observational appearance is dominated by the reradiation of absorbed energy . 
 the one other factor in this equation is @xmath73 . 
 this is the ratio of the optical depths for absorbed and reradiated energy . 
 it can be tuned to reflect an optical depth for incoming stellar light that is either more ( @xmath74 ) or less ( @xmath75 ) opaque than that for the emerging thermal radiation from the planet . 
 note that this does not reduce to equation  ( [ solution2 ] ) in the case of @xmath76 , because the quantity @xmath1 now refers only to infra - red light , and so the flux carried in the beam is not constant with depth ( as it is in   [ model1 ] ) .    in the deep absorption limit ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 + o(\gamma^2)\ ] ] which can be cast to zeroth order in terms of just an extra contribution to the internal flux , 
 as one would expect @xmath79    in the opposite ( @xmath80 ) limit ( absorption high in the atmosphere ) , we have @xmath81\ ] ] the last term , despite the logarithmic function of @xmath73 , still falls off faster that @xmath82 , so retaining only the leading term in @xmath73 leaves @xmath83 + o(\ln \gamma/\gamma^3).\ ] ] so , for high altitude absorption , the zeroth order limit is the simple no - redistribution model of equation  [ solution2 ] . 
 is misleading . 
 one can not maintain the limit @xmath80 at the same time as @xmath84 . 
 one can verify this by taking the appropriate edge - on limit of the full expression , which remains finite . ]    thus , equation  ( [ final_solution ] ) presents us with a simple , yet flexible model that we can use to try and understand how different potential observations probe the properties of hot jupiter atmospheres . 
 one of the primary goals of this study is to provide a flexible framework in which to understand how the observations probe different elements of the physics . 
 so , let us now consider now how this model is reflected in the various kind of observations that are becoming available . 
 a secondary eclipse occurs when a planet in an edge - on orbit ( as measured by the observer ) passes behind the star . 
 the size of the flux decrement observed yields the flux emerging from the substellar side of the planet . 
 more specifically , it represents the flux observed at full phase , when @xmath85 . evaluating the emergent flux integral at this phase , we get @xmath86 . 
 \label{oppf}\ ] ]    in principle , comparing the observed @xmath87 to model values can tell us whether energy is being redistributed to the antistellar side , because then the observed value would be less than expected from the no - redistribution model . 
 we can express this as an effective value of @xmath27 by dividing the reradiation term by @xmath72 , so that @xmath88.\ ] ]    despite the algebraic length of the expression , there is actually remarkably little variation as a function of @xmath73 . as @xmath77 , 
 the limit is @xmath89\ ] ] while the limit as @xmath80 is @xmath90 .\ ] ] figure  [ opp ] shows the function @xmath91 . 
 there is only a change of about 6% between high and low values of @xmath73 . 
 we may thus conclude that , in case of no energy redistribution , it matters little where in the atmosphere the energy is actually absorbed ( at least for secondary eclipse measurements ) . 
 we find that @xmath92 in the large @xmath73 limit , and in the low @xmath73 limit , @xmath93 . 
 we note that this latter value corresponds to the same full - phase fraction derived by milne ( 1926 ) in his treatment of the ` reflection effect ' in close binaries . 
 his treatment amounts to a special case ( @xmath76 ) of the above treatment . 
 the insensitivity of @xmath27 to @xmath73 is encouraging , because it suggests that the comparison of models to secondary eclipse fluxes is robust , in the sense that any flux deficit is likely to indeed be due to the process of redistribution , and not strongly affected by whether the energy is absorbed high in the atmosphere or deep . 
 of course , there is much more information potentially available than just the flux at a single orientation . to start , 
 let us consider the planetary limb - darkening law . neglecting the internal flux term , at full phase we have @xmath94 which is shown in figure  [ limb ] for three values of @xmath95,1 @xmath9610 
 . also shown is the normal limb - darkening law for internally generated heat @xmath97 and the limb - darkening law derived by milne ( 1926 ) in the two - beam approximation @xmath98    we see that all the irradiation - driven profiles are much more limb - darkened than the traditional internally generated profile . 
 this is to be expected , since , near the limb , the irradiation is being absorbed at oblique angles and so spread over more area . 
 absorption high in the atmosphere makes the limb even darker , but the effect is small relative to the dominant effect of the irradiation geometry . 
 the steep dependance on @xmath40 is another way to illustrate why the true value of @xmath27 is @xmath99 rather than @xmath29 ; the region near the substellar point , which is also the hottest , contributes disproportionately to the reradiated flux observed at full phase .      during secondary transit , 
 the face of the planet is steadily eclipsed by the star . 
 thus , the manner in which the total light from the system decreases and increases can , in principle , tell us how light is distributed on the face of the planet . 
 figure  [ trans ] shows the shape of the secondary transit ingress ( i.e. the drop in the system flux as the star occults the planet ) for three cases . in each case , we assume the occulting body is a sharp , vertical boundary . 
 the solid line indicates a planet with the no - redistribution illumination pattern oriented exactly edge - on . 
 the dotted line is for the same model but now with an inclination of 2  degrees . 
 the dashed line indicates a uniform hemisphere planet oriented exactly edge - on . 
 each case assumed the planet radius was 0.1 times that of the star and that the orbital semi - major axis is 12 stellar radii . 
 separating out inclination effects is relatively easy based on the duration of the eclipse , but the measuring differences in illumination pattern by determining the shape of the ingress is going to be quite difficult . 
 the differences are only a few percent at most . 
 this is consistent with other studies concerned with using the shape of secondary transit to infer the presence of non - uniform brightness ( williams et al . 
 2006 ; rauscher et al . 
 greater potential for constraining models is likely to be found in detecting variations in the timing ( williams et al . 
 2006 ) or amplitude ( rauscher et al . 2007b ) of maximum depth . 
 overall then , it appears as though the properties of secondary eclipses are not strongly affected by the value of @xmath73 in this model . 
 this is encouraging , since that means we can make robust inferences about the nature of energy redistribution .      another way to probe 
 the asymmetry of the flux distribution emerging from the planet is to measure the phase curve  the variation in the observed brightness of the planet as it orbits the star . 
 for the simplest case , let us consider the phase curve for a planet which has two hemispheres , each of uniform brightness but at different levels . 
 this amounts to a model in the spirit of the default model in   [ model0 ] . 
 furthermore , let us set the antistellar side to zero brightness , since it is the difference in flux between sub- and antistellar sides that is important . 
 a location on the surface of the sphere is identified by a unit vector defined in terms of two angles , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath100 we consider the direction towards the observer to lie along the x axis , so that the angle cosine between the observer and local normal on the surface of the sphere is then @xmath101 . 
 we also need to specify the direction from which the irradiation comes , using the unit vector @xmath102 where the angle @xmath103 can circulate in a plane rotated by an angle @xmath104 about the y - axis . 
 thus , the angle cosine between this direction and local normal is @xmath105 to take account of the phase , we note that we need not account for the true orbital motion , but only the rotation of the irradiation pattern , since the actual orbital displacement is unresolved by any applicable photometric measurement . 
 thus , our phase curve is described by the circulation of @xmath103 . for the edge - on case ( @xmath106 ) 
 this has an analytic solution for the phase curve @xmath107 for @xmath108 . 
 this applies for brightness of unity for @xmath109 and zero otherwise . 
 evaluation of the integral yields @xmath110 \label{flatsol}\ ] ] which also holds for @xmath111 . 
 figure  [ phase12 ] shows the phase curves for this model and a range of inclinations . 
 we can repeat the same exercise for the model in   [ model1 ] , except that the surface brightness is no longer uniform , since there is an extra factor of @xmath40 in the integrand in equation  ( [ phaseint ] ) . 
 the solution is then @xmath112 \ , \ , \ , ( \lambda < 0 ) \nonumber \\   & = & \frac{2 \pi}{3 } \cos \lambda - \frac{2}{3 } \left [ \lambda \cos \lambda - \sin \lambda \right ] \ , \ , \ , ( \lambda > 0 ) . 
 \label{spotsol}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the lower panel of figure  [ phase12 ] shows the appropriate phase curves . 
 the qualitative difference is that this model has broader troughs and narrower peaks than the uniform hemisphere model . 
 this is a consequence of the concentration of the illumination near the substellar point , so that the phase curve is more sensitive to how this particular region is projected onto the line of sight . 
 some readers will no doubt note that this is the same as the phase curve for a lambert sphere ( e.g. russell 1916 ) . 
 although the lambert sphere is usually invoked to describe reflected light , the conditions under which it is derived ( single , isotropic scattering ) amount to the same conditions as applicable to thermal reradiation .    in figure  [ phase3 ] 
 we show a comparison between these and the phase curves of barman et al ( 2005 ) , calculated with a full radiative transfer model for the no - redistribution case . 
 the models show excellent agreement . 
 this suggests that , for reasonable models , the phase curve is determined primarily by the geometry and less by the effects of changing temperature and atmospheric chemistry towards the limb . 
 indeed , we do not show any phase curves indicating the effect of varying the @xmath73 parameter , because the variation is quite small ( @xmath113 change in amplitude between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with very little change in shape ) . 
 we can also calculate the atmospheric temperature structure of these models , using the mean intensity @xmath7 and the condition of radiative equilibrium , @xmath116 . 
 @xmath117^{1/4},\ ] ] where @xmath118 . 
 ideally , we would like to frame this using a quantity more physically useful than @xmath72 , so we shall define an equivalent temperature by @xmath119 . 
 reframing the equation then , we have @xmath120 +   \mu_0 t^4_{0 } \left [ 1 + \frac{3}{2 } \left ( \frac{\mu_0}{\gamma }   \right)^2   - \frac{3}{2 } \left ( \frac{\mu_0}{\gamma } \right)^3 \ln \left ( 1 + \frac{\gamma}{\mu_0}\right ) - \frac{3}{4 } \frac{\mu_0}{\gamma } e^{- \gamma \tau/\mu_0 } \right ] . \label{tprof}\ ] ]    figure  [ tplot1 ] and figure  [ tplot2 ] show the temperature profiles at a range of angles @xmath40 , for two cases ( @xmath95 and @xmath121 ) , and assuming @xmath122 . for the case 
 where energy is absorbed high in the atmosphere the temperature profiles look pretty similar to the unirradiated case , although the asymptotic value of the temperature as @xmath123 is higher the closer one gets to the substellar point . in the case where energy is mostly absorbed below the reradiative photosphere we find that the temperature profile has two regions where temperature is almost constant  the traditional one at low optical depth but also a second one at @xmath124 , where the bulk of the incoming flux is absorbed . 
 this is similar in character to the profiles found in many detailed radiative transfer models ( e.g. , seager , whitney & sasselov 2000 ; barman et al 2005 , burrows , sudarsky & hubeny 2006 ) . 
 the origin of this intermediate plateau is easily understood . 
 the linearity of the equations of radiative transfer and equilibrium means that the above solution corresponds to the superposition of the solutions to two independent problems  the standard solution radiating @xmath22 at the boundary with no irradiation plus the solution corresponding to zero net energy transfer with the irradiation boundary condition imposed . as noted by milne , 
 the temperature profile arising from this latter solution consists of a gentle transition between two asymptotic temperatures ( at high and low optical depth ) . 
 the difference between the two asymptotes is driven by the last term in equation  ( [ tprof ] ) , leading to a temperature jump @xmath125 , and so is larger for smaller @xmath73 . 
 thus , in figure  [ tplot2 ] we see the behaviour of the zero flux solution at low optical depth and then the transition to the normal thermal profile deeper inside the planet . the same behaviour is found in figure  [ tplot1 ] but the difference between the two asymptotic temperatures is smaller ( larger @xmath73 ) and 
 can barely be discerned in the figure . 
 the presence or absence of spectral lines in secondary eclipse measurements is a topic of recent excitement ( grillmair et al . 
 2007 ; richardson et al . 2007 
 ; swain et al . 
 although our model is founded on the grey atmosphere approximation , we can make simple models of spectral line formation by considering a simple line formation model imposed on the continuum structure represented by our model . 
 consider a spectral absorption line resulting from an excess opacity at some specific wavelength . 
 the line opacity at this wavelength is represented by @xmath126 . 
 we may thus determine the strength of the line using the absorption depth @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the continuum flux , @xmath2 is the standard source function , and @xmath129 is the flux at line center . 
 the function @xmath130 . 
 we assume local lte , so that @xmath131 , and we use the background temperature structure from equation  ( [ tprof ] ) . 
 the resulting integration yields the expected @xmath132 . the same calculation to determine @xmath133 requires that we replace @xmath3 in equation  ( [ tprof ] ) with @xmath134 before evaluating the integral . 
 the resulting expression for @xmath135 , in the limit @xmath136 , is @xmath137 - \ln \left [ 1   + \frac{\gamma}{\mu_0 } \right ] \right ) \right ] . 
 \label{aline}\ ] ] in the case of @xmath77 ( deep absorption ) , we find @xmath138 in the opposite limit of @xmath80 ( high absorption ) , we find @xmath139 thus , we can expect strong absorption lines in the case where the optical opacity is much less than the opacity in the infrared , but weak lines when the optical opacity is large . 
 similar considerations apply in the case of emission lines ( @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) . 
 such behaviour is also consistent with the model proposed in richardson et al . 
 ( 2007 ) for example , which invoke tio or silicate clouds as sources which can absorb energy at low pressures ( high in the atmosphere ) , in order to explain the lack of observable water absorption . 
 spectral line formation is also relevant to the question of absorption line spectroscopy during primary transit ( charbonneau et al . 
 2002 ; vidal - madjar et al . 
 2003 , 2004 ) . however , it is somewhat different in detail , since the observation is essentially measuring the attenuation of a parallel beam illuminating and ( partially ) passing through the limb of the planet . 
 furthermore , we need to make a further approximation , since the calculation of the transverse optical depth at the limb requires a relation between the physical length scale and the optical depth scale .    we make use of the fact that the absorption occurs high in the atmosphere , where the temperature profile is essentially isothermal . 
 we note , however , that the @xmath123 asymptote is still a function of angle from the substellar point . 
 this can be seen from figure  [ tplot1 ] or [ tplot2 ] . 
 assuming that the equation of state is that of an ideal gas , we can approximate the pressure as @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the local scale height . 
 we can then use hydrostatic equilibrium to derive a relation between density and optical depth , so that @xmath144 , where @xmath3 is still the same local radial optical depth as before . we can then also infer the relationship between optical depth and radial distance @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a normalisation constant than can be chosen to fit this approximation ( only valid high in the atmosphere ) to the true relation . 
 note that this relationship is a function of angle , so that a surface of constant optical depth is not spherical . 
 turning to the optical depth for absorption through the limb , which we denote as @xmath148 , we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the cylindrical radius and so @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( we also include a factor @xmath73 to relate this optical absorption to the infrared opacity represented by @xmath153 ) 
 . we can make the evaluation of this integral easier by noting that the scale height is small compared to the radial and cylindrical scales for the atmospheric base . 
 as such , the exponential in the integrand will limit significant contributions to scales such that @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the atmospheric scale height at the limb . 
 this comes about because the density drops rapidly as the light path moves away from @xmath156 and results in a negligible contribution to the absorption . with this approximation 
 the integral becomes @xmath157 we can see then , that at cylindrical radii @xmath150 , the optical depth to transmission is @xmath158 larger than the radial optical depth at that location , meaning that the @xmath159 surface will lie higher in the atmosphere , where @xmath160 ( because @xmath161 ) . 
 using equation  ( [ tautransmit ] ) , we can estimate the so - called ` transit radius effect ' ( baraffe et al . 
 2003 , burrows et al . 
 2003 ) , which is the difference between the radius measured by observing a planetary transit , and that calculated in a traditional stellar model ( which is usually determined at some fixed radial optical depth @xmath162 ) . setting @xmath159 , to determine @xmath163 , and setting @xmath164 to determine @xmath165 , we infer @xmath166.\ ] ] thus 
 , the transit radius increment is proportional to the local scale height at the limb , and only logarithmically dependant on @xmath73 or @xmath162 . 
 recall that @xmath167 , so that there is an inverse relationship with gravity . 
 more surprisingly , there is no direct dependance on the intensity of the illumination , since the asymptotic temperature at the limb ( @xmath168 ) does not depend on @xmath169 . 
 of course , the irradiation does slow the planet cooling , so that @xmath170 would be higher for the same planet under strong illumination , but this is an indirect effect . 
 the models in the previous section considered the absorption and re - emission of all radiation locally , i.e. there was no energy transfer between different locations on the planet . 
 however , we have abundant evidence for strong atmospheric flows in our own giant planets and so it is quite possible that winds and atmospheric circulation could redistribute the absorbed energy over a significant fraction of the planet before it is reradiated 
 . this would have a significant influence on the observations , because the no redistribution model leads to large temperature differences between the substellar and antistellar sides of the planet . 
 thus , we turn now to the case of redistribution of energy over the surface of the planet . in this section 
 , we will return to the approximation of 
 [ model1 ] , wherein we impose the effects of irradiation by use of the outer boundary condition only . 
 we do this in order to isolate the physics of redistribution separately from any considerations about where the energy is actually deposited . in the next section 
 , we will combine our redistribution model with the more detailed @xmath73 models outlined in 
 [ model2 ] . 
 furthermore , we will assume the redistribution of energy over the surface happens at a single , fixed optical depth @xmath171 . 
 this introduces a new source / sink term in the radiative transfer equation to reflect the fact that energy may be added or removed from the net flux , depending on location . 
 equation  ( [ j0 ] ) is thereby replaced by @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a function ( of position on the planet ) describing the local energy input / loss due to atmospheric redistribution . 
 the solution to this equation is of the standard form @xmath14 except that now the first derivative experiences a discontinuous jump at @xmath174 . 
 taking into account the internal flux @xmath22 we find @xmath175 as before , we determine the constant @xmath20 by calculating first @xmath176 and using that to calculate the net flux emerging from the surface @xmath177 where we have again used as our upper boundary condition for incoming radiation a model in which the incoming radiation is modelled as a beam of intensity @xmath72 coming from a direction @xmath40 . 
 furthermore , this net flux has to equal the sum of @xmath22 and the effect of the @xmath173 term , whether it is positive or negative . 
 thus , @xmath178 . using this to determine @xmath20 results in a final answer for the specific intensity of @xmath179\ ] ] where @xmath180 is the standard function found in radiative transfer theory and we have made use of the identity @xmath181 . in the case of @xmath182 , 
 this reverts to equation  ( [ solution2 ] ) .    to model the redistribution , 
 we need to specify the form of the function @xmath173 . 
 we implement redistribution by imposing temperature equilibration on curves imposed by the fluid circulation . 
 recall that , in lte , the specific intensity @xmath6 , which is the local energy density , so that the redistribution of energy essentially involves equilibration of the mean intensity @xmath7 around the appropriate curve . in particular , using equation  ( [ lowtau ] ) , we can calculate @xmath183 , the mean intensity at the optical depth @xmath171 where redistribution is assumed to occur @xmath184 . 
 \label{jw}\ ] ] to complete the model , we also need to specify the geometry , i.e. , along which curve is the temperature equilibrated ? 
 there are a variety of models for the fluid circulation on the surfaces of irradiated planets ( see   [ hydro ] ) , and each offers a different possibility . 
 we will base our model on the simulations of cho et al ( 2003 ) , who find that the strong winds maintain a banded structure , with a hot equator and cold poles . 
 this is qualitatively similar to the bandedness of jupiter and other solar system planets , although the bands are fewer and wider because of the different rotational state of the system . 
 thus , we enforce equilibration of @xmath183 on bands of constant @xmath185 ( the angle measured from the pole of the planet ) . recall that the angle cosine @xmath40 reflects the angle between the local normal and the direction of the irradiating star . casting this in terms of angles relative to the pole , yields @xmath186 . 
 the second term in equation  ( [ jw ] ) is linear in @xmath40 and so we wish @xmath173 to have a similar dependance in order to cancel out some or all of that angular variation , in the interests of redistribution over @xmath187 for constant @xmath185 . 
 thus , we set @xmath188 on the substellar side , and @xmath189 on the antistellar side ( where we do not need the @xmath187 dependance to cancel out any irradiation term ) . 
 energy conservation requires that , if we remove energy at one point on the curve , we must inject it again somewhere else , so that @xmath190 , and so @xmath191 
 . furthermore total equilibration requires that all terms in equation  ( [ jw ] ) that depend on @xmath187 must cancel , yielding an expression for @xmath192 @xmath193 and the resulting mean intensity is @xmath194 the intensity at the surface then follows , @xmath195 where @xmath196 this quantity @xmath197 encapsulates how the surface emission is affected by the depth at which the redistribution occurs . in the limit @xmath198 , @xmath199 , in which case equation  ( [ icomplete ] ) becomes equation  ( [ solution2 ] ) . 
 this is because , if the redistribution occurs deep in the atmosphere , none of the irradiation actually reaches that depth , and the absorbed energy is reradiated in situ as before . on the other hand , as @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and 
 the mean intensity distribution is independent of @xmath187 , although not @xmath185 , reflecting our approximation that the temperature structure is now banded . 
 let us now examine what fraction of the total luminosity is reradiated on the substellar side and the antistellar side . 
 integrating @xmath202 , and then integrating over @xmath185 and @xmath187 , we calculate @xmath203\ ] ] and @xmath204.\ ] ] we see that @xmath205 as @xmath198 , as expected . as @xmath200 on the other hand , @xmath206 asymptotes to almost @xmath207 , as expected in the case of complete redistribution . 
 we will postpone calculation of most of the observables until 
 [ moreapps ] , but we will calculate the expected full - phase flux , as this is the easiest way to estimate whether redistribution is taking place . recall that to calculate the full - phase flux , we calculate @xmath208 , i.e. we impose the condition @xmath85 . 
 however , to do this easily , we need to change angular co - ordinate systems . 
 the equilibration was performed on contours that encircle the pole of the planet , but the integration at full - phase is most conveniently performed in angles measured from the substellar point . 
 thus , let us define the angle @xmath209 as that which circulates about the substellar point , and @xmath210 the angle relative to that point . 
 as a result , @xmath211 . 
 the angle @xmath212 and we can thus perform the integral over @xmath210 and @xmath209 . figure  [ fullf ] shows the resulting flux , expressed in terms of the effective @xmath213 parameter of equation  ( [ supcon1 ] ) . 
 we see that the value tends to the expected no - redistribution value of 2/3 as @xmath198 and comes close to the expected full redistribution value of 0.25 as @xmath200 . 
 the actual asymptotic value is @xmath214^{1/2 } = \frac{8}{3 \pi^2 } = 0.2702.\ ] ]    the resulting phase curves are shown in figure  [ redphase ] . for deep redistribution , the phase curve is very similar to the no redistribution curve , while redistribution at low optical depth suggests almost complete uniformity . 
 we now wish to combine the effects of our models in   [ model2 ] and   [ redis0 ] , 
 that is , allow for both a different optical depth in the optical and ir and for redistribution . 
 this will constitute our final model . 
 thus , equation  ( [ j0 ] ) now has two source / sink terms @xmath215    we follow the same approach as before to derive the mean intensity at @xmath171 @xmath216.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    once again , we wish to equilibrate this quantity on contours of constant @xmath185 . 
 the functional dependance on @xmath187 is now more complicated than a single cosine , so let us denote the last term as @xmath217 , so that all the variation is contained in the function @xmath218 . 
 thus , equilibration requires @xmath219 to cancel out the variations on the substellar side , while preserving the integral over the contour . 
 thus @xmath220 we will henceforth denote @xmath221 the resulting specific intensity at the surface is @xmath222 , \label{ifull}\ ] ] where @xmath197 is defined as in equation  ( [ icomplete ] ) . 
 this looks much the same as the simpler version , with an extra term on the end that accounts for the fact that the energy is deposited over a range in optical depths , and some may be deposited above @xmath171 and some below . 
 we can now calculate how much of the reradiated luminosity is emitted from the substellar side , as a function of @xmath73 and @xmath171 . 
 figure  [ 3lg ] shows the substellar and antistellar fractions as a function of @xmath171 for three different cases , @xmath115 , @xmath76 and @xmath223 . at large @xmath73 , we see the expected behaviour , where large @xmath171 implies that very little energy is reradiated on the antistellar side and small @xmath171 leads to almost complete equilibration . for @xmath224 , @xmath225 and 
 the last term in equation  ( [ ifull ] ) is @xmath226 even if @xmath200 , so that we recover the same equations as in   [ model0 ] . 
 this tells us that absorption high in the atmosphere can still result in complete equilibration as long as @xmath171 is relatively small . 
 however , absorption high in the atmosphere results in little equilibration if @xmath227 .    in the case for @xmath76 we see qualitatively similar behaviour , except that the solution does not asymptote to complete equality as @xmath200 . 
 the difference is even more extreme for @xmath228 . 
 here we see that there is an intermediate regime ( @xmath229 ) where almost complete equality is established , but then that solution diverges again as @xmath200 , with fully three quarters of the luminosity emerging on the substellar side . 
 this is because , in the limit @xmath77 ( corresponding to deep deposition of energy ) , the limit of equation  ( [ ifull ] ) is @xmath230 in which the second term now behaves like a traditional flux contribution , powered by irradiation energy deposited well below the photosphere . 
 the physical origin of this behaviour is that , in this limit , many photons do not contribute to the temperature at low @xmath3 because they are absorbed deep in the atmosphere ( because the optical opacity is so low ) and then escape from below @xmath171 ( which is small in this limit ) . 
 we can summarise the various effects by examining figure  [ lgt ] , which shows contours indicating the fraction of the total absorbed luminosity that is reradiated on the substellar side . 
 we see that there are two regimes which allow for approximate equality between substellar and antistellar sides . 
 the first is for @xmath224 and @xmath231 . 
 this regime corresponds to the case when both absorption and redistribution both occur high in the atmosphere , as might occur if one has a layer of stratospheric clouds and strong stratospheric winds . 
 the second is the perhaps more traditional case of @xmath228 and @xmath232 , where energy deposition and energy redistribution occur at moderate ( infra - red ) optical depths . 
 note also that the contours tend to change direction near the line @xmath233 . above this line 
 much of the irradiation energy is absorbed in regions of the atmosphere above the redistribution region , while below it the incoming photons penetrate to regions below @xmath171 before being absorbed . 
 let us now revisit the various observational probes with our new models and examine how things are changed by the inclusion of redistribution . 
 we can , once again , calculate the full phase flux , as observed during secondary eclipse , using equation  ( [ ifull ] ) once again , the flux integral is performed with @xmath234 . 
 the result is shown in figure  [ fgt ] , where we have again cast the result in terms of the @xmath213 parameter . 
 we see that , for @xmath235 , we recover the no - redistribution limit for all @xmath73 as expected . for a broad range of low and intermediate values of @xmath171 , 
 the value of @xmath213 varies between 0.4 and 0.5 . for low @xmath73 
 , the value of @xmath213 actually has a minimum near @xmath236 . for large @xmath73 , 
 the behaviour is more like the simple model , with near complete redistribution at low @xmath171 , changing monotonically to no redistribution at large @xmath171 . 
 the diversity of values obtained demonstrates the complexity of inferring planetary properties from as simple an observation as comparing a flux level at a single phase to the models . 
 we note that the value @xmath237 that one expects from the naive full redistribution model is realised only in the @xmath231 , @xmath224 limit and that @xmath213 attains intermediate values @xmath238@xmath239 over most of the parameter space . 
 thus , while we may be able to demonstrate , using this kind of observation , that a planet possesses some level of redistribution , it will be difficult to determine specific parameters without additional information .      this behaviour is also reflected in the diversity of phase curves , shown in figure  [ phases ] . 
 the three panels show the phase curves ( for edge - on orbits ) for three choices of @xmath73 . in each panel 
 we show curves for three different @xmath171 . 
 as expected , large @xmath171 makes for a strong variation with phase , while low @xmath171 results in a very flat phase curve . at low @xmath73 values 
 , this distinction is blurred somewhat . 
 figure  [ fphase ] summarises this behaviour . 
 we show here the amplitude of the observable phase variation @xmath240 , from peak to trough , expressed once again in terms of @xmath213 . 
 we see , not surprisingly , similar behaviour to figure  [ fgt ] . in the large @xmath171 limit 
 , we recover @xmath241 , essentially no redistribution . 
 on the other hand , amplitudes of @xmath242 are obtainable in the same two regimes as identified above . once again 
 , intermediate behaviour is recovered over most of the parameter space , with phase variations @xmath243 of the no - redistribution model expected . 
 figure  [ redlimb ] shows the influence of redistribution on the limb - darkening of the planet , when observed at full phase . with the model of redistribution 
 adopted here , the limb is no longer at a constant intensity , but rather shows a variation @xmath244 . 
 figure  [ redlimb ] shows contours of the contrast observed at full phase between the intensity at @xmath245 ( the limb at the equator ) and the intensity at the center @xmath246 . 
 we see that deep redistribution ( @xmath235 ) yields low values , indicating strongly darkened limbs , as in the no - redistribution case . 
 we also find dark limbs in the limit @xmath228 and @xmath231 , where the energy is absorbed deep in the star but redistribution occurs high in the atmosphere . 
 however , for @xmath224 ( absorption high in the atmosphere ) , we actually find equality and possibly even limb - brightening . 
 similar effects have been seen in more detailed models , for instance when the addition of metals results in a large amount of stratospheric absorption ( fortney et al 2006 ) . 
 we can also examine the temperature profile . 
 for @xmath247 , @xmath248   \frac { < \phi > } { 2 } + \right . 
 \nonumber \\   & & \left . 
 \frac{\tau - \tau_w}{\tau_w + 2/3 + 2 ( e^{-\tau_w } - 2 e_4 ( \tau_w ) ) } \phi   + \frac{3}{4 } \frac{\mu_0 \cos \phi_p}{\gamma } \left [ e^{-\gamma \tau_w/\mu_0 } - e^{-\gamma \tau/\mu_0 } \right ] \right ) \right ] . 
 \label{tprofw}\end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath249 , the temperature profile still obeys equation  ( [ tprof ] ) . 
 figure  [ tprof1 ] shows temperature profiles for two cases where @xmath115 . in the upper panel , 
 we show the result for shallow redistribution ( @xmath250 ) and in the lower panel , deep redistribution ( @xmath251 ) . in each case , the solid curve is the temperature profile at the substellar point ( @xmath252 , @xmath253 ) and the dotted curve is for the limb ( @xmath254 , @xmath255 ) . in each case 
 , the ratio @xmath256 and the temperature is measured relative to the true internal @xmath170 . in the case of @xmath251 , the effect of the temperature jumps 
 are largely erased by the time @xmath123 , presumably because most of the absorbed energy never reaches @xmath257 when @xmath115 . in this case , a temperature inversion is evident , and an important part of the energy balance at moderate @xmath3 is thus the transport of energy inwards by thermal radiation from overlying layers heated by the stellar photons . 
 thus , equilibration at @xmath250 does a much better job of smoothing out the temperature variations .    in the opposite limit ( @xmath223 ) , deep absorption , 
 the temperature profiles are shown in figure  [ tprof2 ] . in this case , the opposite behaviour is seen . 
 the deep redistribution case is effective , because most of the irradiation energy is deposited in deeper layers and is included in the thermal balance at @xmath258 . in the shallow redistribution case , 
 the temperatures near the substellar point are much hotter at @xmath259 and so this case shows a strong asymmetry . 
 there is an interesting center - to - limb temperature inversion at low @xmath3 for this case , but it will be difficult to probe with any vertically integrated measures . 
 we can evaluate the integrals for spectral line formation in a similar fashion as in   [ spec1 ] , although the algebra is somewhat more painful this time , and so we will not write the full expression down here . figure  [ line1 ] shows the contours of @xmath260 that result from the appropriate integration in the case where @xmath261 , for the usual range of @xmath73 and @xmath171 . 
 the calculation is once again at full phase orientation . 
 we see that the strength of the line is relatively weak for @xmath74 and rather insensitive to @xmath171 . 
 this is what we expect on the basis of figure  [ tprof1 ] , because the temperature profile is close to isothermal . for @xmath262 
 , the results are more sensitive to @xmath171 , and can be quite strong in the case where @xmath171 has a value only slightly larger than unity . 
 this is because the combination of sharp temperature jumps and different opacity scales can lead to large contrasts between line and continuum . 
 the overall goal of this exercise is to develop a simple framework within which one can examine the qualitative features of the irradiated atmosphere problem . 
 clearly , a simple , semi - analytic model such as this can not replace numerical models that incorporate detailed treatments of radiative transfer , chemical equilibrium ( and disequilibrium ) and hydrodynamics . however , the complexity of the various physical inputs into these models often results in a situation in which the physical understanding lags behind the calculational output . as a result , 
 simplified models provide a pedagogical framework which can guide the more detailed models . 
 this is likely to be particularly useful as we try to develop physical models for the redistribution of energy within an irradiated planet atmosphere . 
 this is likely to be a difficult and costly enterprise , and the simplified models may help to illuminate the nature of the desired solution and possible pitfalls on the path to their realisation . as a first step , 
 we wish to cast our models in terms of the more detailed models in the literature , in the sense of describing which of our simple models correspond to the more detailed models .    the first attempts to treat the structure of irradiated giant planets ( saumon et al . 
 1996 ; guillot et al . 
 1996 ) used essentially grey atmosphere models with a simple asymptotic temperature criterion . the first real attempt to model 
 the radiative transfer under conditions appropriate to hot jupiters was by seager & sasselov ( 1998 ) . 
 these models were dust free , and the incoming optical / uv radiation was found to penetrate well below the infra - red photosphere . 
 these models therefore fall into the @xmath262 category , and establish a theme for most of the subsequent literature . 
 this was followed by barman , hauschildt & allard ( 2001 ) , who produced two sets of models , `` clear '' , in which condensates were removed by a rainout process , or `` cloudy '' , in which the condensates were assumed to form clouds in situ . 
 the cloudy models were found to yield clouds extending from the photosphere upwards to low optical depths , and most likely correspond to the @xmath263 case . 
 this is supported by the claim that this led to much smoother emergent spectra than in the clear case , as expected for spectral features in the @xmath264 model . 
 sudarsky , burrows & hubeny ( 2003 ) present a variety of models , covering a large range of irradiations . 
 the models they classify as classes iv and v are most appropriate to hot jupiters . 
 the majority of their models clearly fall within the @xmath262 regime . 
 this can best be illustrated by the temperature profiles . 
 their figure  12 shows how the temperature profile of a planet changes as it is moved closer to a g0v primary . at distances @xmath265 
 au , the temperature profile developes a plateau at pressures @xmath2661  bar , evolving to a shape very similar to that in figure  [ tplot1 ] . for the hottest planets , iron and forsterite condensates 
 are possible at high altitude , leading to smaller plateaus , as might be expected for larger @xmath73 atmospheres . 
 the clouds in this case are localised , however , and so the analogy with the @xmath73 models is not as good as for the barman et al . 
 ( 2001 ) models .    for the purposes of calibration the models of barman , hauschildt & allard ( 2005 ) 
 are of particular interest because they calculated a truly two - dimensional model and so produce temperature profiles as a function of angle from the substellar point , rather than just a single ` representative ' profile . 
 we can thus accurately calibrate the effective @xmath73 of their model by making use of the temperature value of the observed plateau in the model . 
 we calibrate @xmath169 using the known properties of the hd  209458b system , @xmath267  k. taking the profile from their figure  4 for hd  209458b at the substellar point , the high temperature plateau has a value @xmath268  k. we identify this value with the @xmath269 limit of the irradiation term in equation  ( [ tprof ] ) . 
 we use this expression for clarity since the barman et al . 
 models are for the case of no redistribution , but equation  ( [ tprofw ] ) reduces to this in the limit of @xmath198 . 
 the temperature of this plateau is @xmath270 = 2500 ^ 4 . 
 \label{trav2}\ ] ] we can solve this to infer @xmath271 for @xmath272 . 
 figure  [ func ] shows the expression @xmath273 as a function of @xmath73 . 
 we see that the inner plateau temperature increases as @xmath73 decreases , with the energy getting deposited at greater depth . 
 the lower asymptote for these values of @xmath73 and @xmath169 is derived from @xmath274 ( shown as the lower curve in figure  [ func ] ) , and yields a temperature @xmath275  k. furthermore , barman et al . 
 use an internal luminosity effective temperature of @xmath276  k. the resulting temperature profiles are shown in figure  [ bha ] . 
 the agreement with figure  4 of barman et al is excellent for @xmath277 ( corresponding to @xmath278  mbar ) . at low optical depths , 
 the temperature drops lower in the detailed models , although it does eventually asymptote to higher temperatures off the edge of the given plot ( barman , private communication ) . 
 this behaviour presumably reflects the non - monotonic nature of the real opacity at high altitudes . 
 a general feature of these kinds of model is that ( infrared ) optical depth unity lies somewhere in the middle of the transition between the two plateau . 
 this can be seen in other models as well , such as from the location of the ` brightness temperature region ' in figure  1 of fortney et al . 
 ( 2005 ) . 
 the detection of secondary eclipses in the hd209458 and tres-1 systems generated a flurry of theoretical activity . of particular interest 
 was the question of whether energy was transferred from the day side to the night side . 
 however , all of these models were flux - conserving and so approximate redistribution by diluting the incoming flux by an appropriate factor @xmath27 . 
 burrows , sudarsky & hubeny ( 2005 ) compare their @xmath279 ( full redistribution ) models to the observed data and find that they are too faint , suggesting that less dilution is best . 
 bsh also express surprise that adding iron or forsterite clouds to their models does not change the predicted fluxes by an appreciable amount . 
 we can understand this by noting that increasing @xmath73 at fixed @xmath280 does not change the predicted @xmath213 , as was noted in 
 [ sec1 ] and can be seen from figure  [ fgt ] . 
 fortney et al . 
 ( 2005 ) find that they can not fit the two irac measurements for tres-1 with a model without redistribution , but are able to almost fit the data with a diluted radiation field appropriate to significant redistribution . 
 the temperature profiles in their figure  1 suggest again that their model lies in the @xmath281 regime , with the characteristic two - plateau behaviour very evident . 
 they note that the inclusion of an arbitrary extra continuum opacity in the range 26@xmath4 m would improve the fit , and which would also move their model to larger @xmath73 . 
 seager et al . 
 ( 2005 ) include , as an additional constraint , a limit on the flux variation at wavelengths @xmath282 m ( richardson et al . 2003 ) . 
 this places limits on the depth of observable water bands at near - ir wavelengths . 
 combining this with the secondary eclipse measurements , they found that the clear ( @xmath281 ) models were ruled out , but models with thick , absorbative clouds did match the models . in this case clouds composed of silicates extend from 0.85  mbar and iron condensates from 1.310  mbar . from their figure  4 , we can infer directly the approximate @xmath73 values appropriate to their models . in the case of the cloud - free models , 
 the optical photosphere lies at greater pressures than the infrared photosphere , and @xmath283 , while the cloudy model has @xmath284 . 
 similarly barman et al . 
 ( 2005 ) find that their no - redistribution model overpredicts the flux at irac wavelengths , so they too infer that some level of energy redistribution must be occuring .    subsequently , fortney et al . 
 ( 2006 ) have used enhanced metallicity models to predict the structure of the newly discovered hot jupiter hd149026 
 b. their models with 3 times solar metallicity , when calculated in the ` 4@xmath285 ' ( full redistribution ) case , have little cloud absorption because the relevant condensation curves lie at pressures of hundreds of bars . in the ` 2@xmath285 ' ( no redistribution ) case , the models result in hot stratospheres because the tio and vo absorption is present at lower pressures for such hot models . 
 the comparison between the resulting temperature profiles can also be understood in the context of our models , since the increase in @xmath73 for the no redistribution model leads to a smaller temperature difference between the two plateau , as observed . in this case 
 though , even the hotter model still lies in the @xmath262 regime . 
 burrows , sudarsky & hubeny ( 2006 ) make a first attempt at predicting phase curves while including a primitive redistribution prescription , in which they remove a fraction @xmath286 of the irradiation energy ( i.e. this is still a dilution model ) and then incorporate it as an extra internal energy source on the antistellar side . 
 their temperature profiles again very clearly conform to the @xmath262 structure we have seen before , consistent with their neglect of clouds . 
 they do , however , discuss one ` extreme ' model with significant heating of the stratosphere using significant tio and vo absorption in the upper atmosphere . 
 this may indeed lie with the @xmath263 regime . 
 burrows et al present phase curves for a variety of values of @xmath286 and bandpasses , and note that even significant redistribution can still leave some remnant phase variation because of the non - uniform temperature pattern on the substellar side . 
 this has some qualitative resemblance to the kinds of variation seen in figure  [ fphase ] . 
 however , all of the previous attempts to model redistribution have relied on some kind of dilution of the original radiation , rather than removal of the energy at the appropriate point in the atmosphere . 
 the models discussed here allow us to examine how the temperature profile changes if we actually include sources and sinks at different points in the atmosphere . 
 let us consider the effect of redistribution at different @xmath171 , using our calibrated version of the barman et al . 
 ( 2005 ) model , shown in figure  [ bha ] . 
 figure  [ bh3 ] shows the effect , on the temperature profile at the substellar point , of moving @xmath171 to progressively smaller values . 
 because this is for the substellar point , redistribution removes energy at the specified location , resulting in some pronounced local temperature inversions . 
 in fact , for @xmath287@xmath288 , there is a pronounced local peak in the temperature , resulting from a competition between the local deposition of irradiation energy and the removal by redistribution . at low enough @xmath171 
 , we start to see a significant drop in the stratospheric temperature . 
 the equatorial variation in temperature profile , from center to limb , is shown in figure  [ bh6 ] , for the case @xmath289 . 
 we see that the effect of redistribution changes from a sink to a source for @xmath290 , although the general character of a hot substellar point is retained , albeit with reduced amplitude . in the case 
 where @xmath291 , shown in figure  [ bh7 ] , the temperature at high altitudes is much more uniform . 
 these effects apply for the case of @xmath281 , which applies to most of the models in the literature . however , there is tentative evidence that some systems may favour the @xmath263 regime , so let us consider redistribution in this case . 
 first , we show in figure  [ bh2 ] the effect of changing @xmath73 , while keeping all other inputs fixed . 
 the dotted line shows our calibrated model for @xmath292 . 
 lower values of @xmath73 result in even higher temperature plateau , as expected , while larger @xmath73 drives the atmosphere closer to an isothermal state . 
 this is precisely why the observed lack of spectral lines favours a high @xmath73 model . 
 figure  [ bh4 ] then shows the effects of different @xmath171 at the substellar point , but this time for the @xmath121 model . 
 the temperature jumps are less in this case , but there are still temperature inversions directly above the layer where redistribution occurs . 
 however , the stratospheric temperatures do return to close to their value in the @xmath198 case , with large differences only becoming apparent at @xmath293 . 
 we note , however , that it is precisely this region ( large @xmath73 , moderate @xmath171 ) that seems to be preferred by the data for hd209458b and hd189733b . 
 we have thus far discussed the attempts to model energy redistribution in terms of calculations of radiative transfer . a second , and mostly independent , body of work 
 is focussed on the hydrodynamics of irradiated atmospheres and how this might , in turn , influence the redistribution of energy . 
 the complexity of the physics involved has resulted in somewhat divergent treatments of the phenomenon , each placing emphasis on different aspects of the phenomenon . 
 showman & guillot ( 2002 ) performed three - dimensional fluid dynamical simulations of the atmosphere , finding the existence of broad east - west jets and strong residual temperature contrasts at the photosphere . 
 their models also suggested that some fraction of the irradiation energy might get transported deeper into the planet , where it might help to explain the anomalously large radius of hd  209458b . 
 iro et al . 
 ( 2005 ) , however , found that very little energy was deposited at pressures @xmath294  bars . 
 iro et al . 
 use a coarse version of a one - dimensional radiative transfer model , and include temporally variable forcing to mimic the planetary rotation . 
 however , they do confirm the existence of a strong phase variation within the context of their model , which also fits into the @xmath262 class of our models . in an updated version of their three - dimensional model , cooper & showman ( 2005 ) 
 quantify their phase variation , predicting that the equatorial fluid motions should shift the peak of the phase variation @xmath295 downstream , although subsequent revisions of the model quoted in knutson et al . 
 ( 2007b ) find a smaller phase shift . 
 similar behaviour is found by langton & laughlin ( 2007 ) . 
 an entirely different approach was taken by cho et al . 
 ( 2003 ; 2008 ) , using a high resolution , two - dimensional model of the fluid equations on a rotating sphere , treated in the shallow water approximation . 
 cho et al . 
 find generic behaviour in which the principal hydrodynamical feature is a small number of broad equatorial bands , accompanied by coherent polar vortices that rotate about the pole on timescales of several planetary rotation periods . 
 the motion of the temperature field is found to be quite diverse , depending on the strength of the heating and momentum transport in the atmosphere and where the energy is deposited . 
 fluid motions are responsible not only for equilibration , but potentially also mixing . 
 cooper & showman ( 2006 ) showed that hydrodynamic mixing processes can smooth out temperature and compositional differences between different parts of the atmosphere . 
 they predict that this will lead to homogeneous carbon chemistry , with most of the carbon residing in co and very little in ch@xmath296 at low ( @xmath2971 bar ) pressures . 
 furthermore , the resulting temperature structure is considerably more isothermal and model spectra show weak features ( fortney et al . 
 2006 ) , in similar fashion to the observations . 
 it is interesting to consider these latter models in the light of our @xmath73 parameter . a uniform vertical redistribution of energy by hydrodynamic mixing can be considered equivalent to uniform absorption throughout the atmosphere , and can lead to a higher effective @xmath73 than might be inferred simply from the opacity . 
 examination of fortney et al . 
 ( 2006 ) suggests another application of our method . 
 they use a global dynamical simulation of the atmosphere to calculate how the temperature profile varies across the face of the planet and then calculate many one - dimensional radiative transfer models to quantify the likely spectral appearance as determined by the true two - dimensional surface variations . 
 however , they were not able to iterate between the dynamical model and radiative transfer model to achieve a true radiative equilibrium because of the prohibitive computational expense that would entail 
 . a model such as the one described here , suitably parameterised by an effective @xmath73 , could be used as an intermediate approximation to enforce a global energetic equilibrium while still retaining the spirit of the radiative transfer model . 
 the resulting temperature distribution could then be used to calculate the detailed appearance . 
 in summary , the intent of the models presented here was to understand the qualitative behaviour of radiative transfer in hot jupiter atmospheres . 
 the simplified nature of the models is dictated by the difficulties of including both full radiative transfer and detailed hydrodynamics , both of which are important parts of a proper understanding of the phenomenon . 
 in particular we have studied how the models change depending on the parameters @xmath73 ( which reflects the difference in opacity for incoming optical - wavelength radiation and outgoing infrared - wavelength radiation ) and @xmath171 ( the depth at which energy is redistributed horizontally across the planets atmosphere ) . 
 we have also studied how the various new observational probes of hot jupiter atmospheres are influenced by changes in these parameters . 
 we find that models in which redistribution occurs at large infra - red optical depths redistribute little energy to the night side ( as expected ) . 
 perhaps more surprisingly , we find that significant day / night flux differences can also be found in the case @xmath298 , as long as @xmath281 as well . 
 we find that day - side temperature inversions are a generic feature of atmospheres in which the redistribution occurs at moderate ( @xmath2361000 ) optical depths . 
 this is of interest because of recent claims that temperature inversions have been found in hd  209458b ( knutson et al . 
 the initial explanation for such behaviour is high altitude absorption ( burrows et al . 
 2007 ; fortney et al . 2007 ) , although the very low albedo ( rowe et al . 2007 ) restricts the absorbing species to be a poor reflector . 
 some level of redistribution is required to explain the hd  209458  b secondary eclipse amplitude and ( lack of ) phase variations , so that another potential explanation for the temperature inversion may simply be that it is related to the depth at which the energy is removed from the day - side . 
 certainly , figures  [ bh6 ] and [ bh7 ] show that some parts of the planet experience pronounced temperature inversions , even without a significant high altitude absorber . however , it will require detailed radiative transfer models to confirm whether this is a viable model or not . 
 our initial exploration has been far from exhaustive . 
 one important advantage of these toy grey atmosphere models is their flexibility , and we have studied how energy redistribution changes the character of the models 
 . this will hopefully provide a guide as to how one might perform similar calculations using the more detailed models , which presently can only consider changes at either the top or bottom of the atmosphere . 
 furthermore , we have also not exhausted the parameter space of toy models . 
 for instance , one can imagine many other redistribution schemes apart from the one we have implemented here .

39,"there is significant evidence that most of the energy density in the universe resides in the forms yet unknown , but the physical nature of this dark matter is an issue of live debate and is far from being understood @xcite . 
 typical explainations invoke either compact objects , such as primordial black holes , stellar remnants or planets , or continuous material such as weakly interacting massive particles , unseen hydrogen or more exotic explainations . 
 potential clues to the nature of dark matter have recently been uncovered with the detection of neutrino mass and observations of compact massive objects thought to be mostly white dwarfs in galactic neighbourhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 however , given their mass neutrinos can not contain more than @xmath113 per cent of the dark matter mass budget @xcite . 
 furthermore , the halo microlensing programs constrain compact objects in the mass range of @xmath2 to making no more than 10 per cent of the galactic halo @xcite . 
 gravitational lensing has allowed the detailed reconstruction of the projected mass distribution in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 unfortunately such analysis does not probe the fundamental nature of dark matter . 
 however , although deflection angles due to compact objects in the dark matter are negligible their derivatives may be substantial which means that although the granularity of dark matter can not change the morphology of lensed systems , this _ microlensing _ can have significant impact on the observed fluxes @xcite . 
 as the mutual configuration of sources and lenses change with time , this results in variability of the observed flux . 
 several microlensing programs have been proposed and undertaken , the most successful of them being the microlensing experiments towards galactic bulge and magellanic clouds by macho , eros and ogle collaborations @xcite . 
 another approach is pixel lensing when the search focuses not on individual sources but on a large number of stars seen as a single pixel of the image . 
 events of strong lensing of a single star can be detected in the pixel light though they never dominate it . 
 such events have been discussed in connection with the galaxies m31 and m87 @xcite , and a few observational programs monitoring these galaxies have been implemented @xcite .    further away from the galaxy 
 , it has been proposed to search for microlensing - induced variability of quasars seen through galaxy clusters @xcite . 
 this has been undertaken for the virgo cluster , although its close proximity ensures that the optical depth to microlensing is low . 
 although analysis of the quasar variability based on a long observation series by @xcite let him conclude that the dark matter may be dominated by jupiter - mass microlenses , this idea is not widely supported . 
 one of the difficulties here is that quasars are expected to possess intrinsic variability @xcite which significantly complicates microlensing studies . 
 totani ( 2003 ) proposed to explore the advantage of the recent discovery of a galaxy cluster found just behind the rich cluster abell 2152 but this has yet to result in an observational program . 
 another possibility is to look for the variations in surface brightness of strongly lensed distant galaxies 
 e.g. , giant gravitationally lensed arcs ( lewis & ibata 2001 ; lewis , ibata & wyithe 2000 ) . 
 they are found in the regions of large magnification and therefore high optical depth . assuming that microlenses make up an appreciable fraction of the lensing mass , it means that in any instant all the stars in a pixel are subject to strong microlensing and therefore an investigation of the surface brightness variability is effectively reduced to an investigation of the behaviour of the sum of a large number of individual fluxes with fairly well known individual statistical properties . 
 this study extends the analysis of @xcite and provides a general method for the analytic calculation of variability patterns given the convergence and shear values . 
 we apply it to the two well - studied galaxy clusters - abell 370 and abell 2218 . in the next section 
 we describe and justify the method we use , and then calculate the value of individual microlensing - induced variability dispersion as a function of standard microlensing parameters . 
 section 3 discusses observational prospects for detecting this sort of variability . 
 we discuss our results in section 4 . 
 the goal of this section is to learn to characterize the variability in pixels of images of distant galaxies with a few parameters . 
 we show that the high optical depth and large numbers of stars forming the pixel allow one to reduce this to a single parameter  dispersion  as the observed flux distribution can be approximated by the gaussian function with good accuracy . 
 the major assumption we make in our investigation is that the fluxes of individual stars , which vary as stars and lenses move with respect to each other , do so independently . this is a natural assumption since individual stars in the source plane are distributed in a random manner . 
 it might be worth considering the presence of some form of agglomerations in pixels but this seems to be an unnecessary complication at the present stage . 
 we consider statistical properties ` as static ' 
 i.e. on time scales greater than typical individual variability scale given by the time of einstein - chwolson radius crossing ( @xmath3 ) , and therefore are interested in the probability distribution function of the summed pixel flux . 
 the typical fluxes in pixels forming images of strongly lensed galaxies correspond to the range in luminosity of thousands to billions of solar luminosities - and therefore contain very large numbers of stars . 
 this fact along with the variability independence immediately suggests using the central limit theorem to infer the statistical properties of the pixel flux . 
 indeed , let the intrinsic ( unlensed ) fluxes of the pixel population stars be @xmath4 , n being the number of stars in the pixel . 
 if we neglect the fraction of stars intrinsically variable at the same level and time scale as the variability caused by the microlensing , the role of @xmath5 is to normalize the variability in magnification factor @xmath6 arising as the source stars move through the magnification map : @xmath7 and @xmath6 can be considered a random variable . 
 the probability distribution of @xmath6 does depend on the individual characteristics of the source  mostly , the size of its disc . 
 however , as we will see in the following section , this dependence is not strong and , to show the validity of gaussian approximations it is enough to assume that @xmath6 distribution is identical for all @xmath8 and only depends on ( macro ) lensing parameters in the pixel . 
 the flux observed in the pixel is given by @xmath9 and its average value is @xmath10 where the bar denotes the averaging over the lensing configuration at a given convergence and shear ( assuming a sort of ergodic hypothesis this is equivalent to averaging over time ) . 
 let us define @xmath11 and consider the deviation of @xmath12 from its average value : @xmath13 let us also define the second and third moments of the distribution in @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . clearly , the corresponding moments for @xmath17 equal @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    according to lyapunov theorem 
 , the actual probability distribution function f of @xmath20 tends to the gaussian approximation @xmath21 where we dropped @xmath22 subscript for clarity , with @xmath23 the accuracy of this approximation in kolmogorov ( @xmath24 ) measure @xmath25 is not worse than @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite . 
 although the value of the second fraction in @xmath29 may , depending on @xmath22 , be as large as unity its typical value is of order @xmath30 , where the angled brackets denote averaging over the luminosity function ( which , up to a distance- and band - dependent constant , is the distribution of intrinsic fluxes ) .    with the luminosity function given by @xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , therefore @xmath33 to estimate the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 
 it is sufficient to use a rather coarse ` model ' probability distribution density @xmath36 which is normalized to unity and has three basic properties established theoretically :    1 . 
 @xmath37 at @xmath38 2 . 
 @xmath39 , @xmath40 3 . 
 @xmath41 at @xmath42 . 
 the job is done by the following ` model ' @xmath36 : @xmath43 ^ 2 } \ , . 
 \label{modelpmu}\ ] ] the second condition implies @xmath44 . 
 this distribution does not possess the second moment , let alone the third , as a result of the ( iii ) property . 
 however , the finite size of the source places a cut - off @xmath45 at the high values of @xmath14 ( for a single point mass @xmath45 is nearly inversely proportional to the source size as was shown by @xcite ) . since @xmath46 
 it does not affect either norm or the first moment and 
 therefore with @xmath47 and @xmath48 we have @xmath49 with typical for gravitationally lensed arcs values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52  in a pixel @xmath53 . 
 this means that when talking about a deviation of at least one standard value @xmath54 , for which the gaussian probability is @xmath55 , one can be sure that the actual probability of such a deviation is not less than ( 5  25 ) per cent .    strictly speaking , the minimum magnification value for microlensing at high optical depth is greater than one used in ( i ) as was shown by @xcite , and one could rather use some model value for this quantity @xcite . 
 however , this does not have much impact on the estimate of the validity of our approximation . 
 perhaps more important is that due to the value of minimum magnification which is greater than unity , gaussian approximation clearly can not hold exactly as it assigns non - zero probability to flux values below the minimum . however , this inconsistency is well inside the uncertainty of our method , given by  ( [ cahere ] ) and does not affect our results .    the initial task is thus reduced to calculating the only parameter of a centered gaussian distribution  its dispersion . as @xmath22 is not known _ a priori _ ( and neither it can be known well _ a posteriori _ ) , @xmath56 is to be averaged over all possible @xmath22 . 
 this can easily be done by considering the following three random variables : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the value of interest . here 
 , again the bar denotes averaging in the @xmath14 domain while angled brackets mean averaging over @xmath22 . 
 as these three quantities are ( nearly ) gaussian and uncorrelated ( the correlation vanishes when averaging over @xmath14 ) , the following relation holds : @xmath61 clearly , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the dispersion of individual flux @xcite .    for the second quantity we may write : @xmath64 and therefore @xmath65 the dispersion of the quantity @xmath66  the relative fluctuation 
 is thus given by : @xmath67 as @xmath68 is not known either we will just divide the observed flux of the pixel @xmath69 by the mean magnification factor and mean individual stellar flux to get a first - order estimate : @xmath70 thus , @xmath71 with the first factor in this formula being approximately @xmath72 for the luminosity function of @xcite and the variability extent @xmath73 this quantity is therefore of our prime interest . 
 in calculating the variability extent @xmath74 we employ the method of @xcite , who improved and generalized previous works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to make possible the calculation of microlensing correlation functions in the case of non - zero shear . 
 we , however , slightly modify his equations and evaluation method for our specific needs . 
 let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the light ray positions in the lens @xmath77 and source @xmath78 planes , respectively . 
 the normalized lens equation is then ( kayser , refsdal , stabell 1986 ; paczyski 1986 ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 here @xmath81 , while @xmath82 is the smooth matter covergence and @xmath83 is the shear , both expressed in critical units @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a reduced ( angular diameter ) distance @xmath87 the masses of the microlenses @xmath88 are given in units of @xmath89  the quantity which also defines einstein radii @xmath90 and @xmath91  physical length units in which @xmath92 and @xmath93 of  ( [ lenseq ] ) are expressed  in lens and source planes : @xmath94 @xmath95 in the case we consider the microlensing shear @xmath96  the second term in  ( [ lenseq ] )  is an isotropic random variable . changing the sign of 
 @xmath97 has the effect of only redefining coordinate axes and since this is not of interest for us we drop the @xmath98 factor in  ( [ lenseq ] ) and use absolute value of @xmath97 from now on . 
 the magnification factor at a point @xmath76 in the source plane may be written in an elegant form @xcite : @xmath99 the average of @xmath14 is @xmath100 ^ 2[(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2]|}\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the scaled microlensing optical depth with @xmath102 being the surface number density of microlenses and angled brackets now meaning averaging over microlens mass distribution @xmath103 . 
 we consider a lambert disc  a disc of uniform surface brightness  with radius @xmath104 in @xmath91 units and total flux @xmath105 . 
 the average value of _ observed _ flux @xmath106 does not depend on the microlens mass distribution and is only a function of lensing macro parameters : @xmath107 with @xmath108 as shown in the appendix a , the following relation holds for @xmath74 : @xmath109r^2/2 } \ , . 
 \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] the integration is done from zero to infinity in @xmath110 and @xmath111 and from zero to @xmath112 in angular variable @xmath113 . 
 function @xmath114 in this formula is given by @xcite and is described in the appendix a.    introducing the function @xmath115 and performing the variable change @xmath116 , @xmath117 we get the following integral to be evaluated : @xmath118 this evaluation is done in appendix b under the assumptions that @xmath119 and @xmath120 . 
 the former is plausible , since in a cosmological situation with @xmath121  cm , the length scale  ( [ zeta0 ] ) is @xmath122 while typical physical sizes of sources are @xmath123  cm . 
 however , it immediately places a constraint on the microlens masses and the smooth component convergence : @xmath124 therefore the results derived below are not directly applicable to situations where  ( [ constraint ] ) is not fulfilled , which may be of interest when jupiter - mass lenses are involved or for detailed investigations of microlensing in the region @xmath125 . 
 microlensing of large sources was considered numerically by @xcite in the zero shear case and later including the effect of a shear term @xcite . quite naturally 
 , increasing the size of the source suppresses microlensing - induced fluctuations , averaging them over less correlated regions of the magnification map . 
 however , for sources as large as @xmath126 they find values of @xmath127 in a range of @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( it was found that @xmath130 in zero shear case ) . 
 this is only an order of magnitude less than the numbers we obtain below and shows , that even objects billions times less massive than the sun could introduce noticeable variability provided they contribute to the overall compact object density ( however , the time scale of this kind of variability will be much shorter ) . 
 the second assumption  which relates @xmath97 and @xmath104  is of a rather technical nature and does not restrict our scope whenever marginal cases of zero shear are not considered .    as shown in the appendix b , under these assumptions the integral  ( [ thebigthing ] ) may be then rewritten in the following form : @xmath131 - 1 \ , , \label{itutti}\ ] ] where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , defined by  ( [ itut ] ) and  ( [ g3def ] ) , are computed numerically . 
 the actual values of @xmath134 do not exceed @xmath135 . 
 therefore we neglect the weak dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath104 putting @xmath136 .     as a function of convergence in microlenses @xmath137 and 
 shear @xmath97 . ] 
 the contour lines of constant @xmath138 are shown in figure  [ epsilonmufig ] for the range of parameters @xmath137 and @xmath97 present in the observed clusters . 
 computations near the lines @xmath139 are unreliable and are therefore ignored on the graph . 
 the actual values of @xmath137 and @xmath97 depend on both the physical surface density at the point in the lensing plane where the image is formed and the scaling parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 given by  ( [ sigmao],[gammao ] ) which in turn are functions of the distance parameter @xmath86  ( [ ddef ] ) and thus  of lens and source redshifts and underlying cosmology . 
 if we consider the redshift of the lens @xmath142 as fixed , the values of convergence and shear would depend on the source redshift @xmath143 . 
 as @xmath144 and @xmath145 and the same applies to the shear , @xmath137 and @xmath97 are directly proportional to @xmath86 and can be written in a simple form : @xmath146 with @xmath147 and @xmath148 being the convergence and shear corresponding to a given redshift @xmath149 . 
 for the currently favoured flat cosmological models ( @xmath150 ) @xmath151 where @xmath152 as @xmath153 is a monotonic increasing function of its argument and @xmath143 is clearly greater than @xmath142 , the second fraction in  ( [ kgprop ] ) @xmath154 increases from zero at @xmath155 through unity at @xmath156 to some limiting value @xmath157  determined by @xmath142 , @xmath149 and @xmath158  when @xmath159 . 
 this is somewhat different from considering convergence and shear as functions of @xmath142 , in which case there exists an optimal lens redshift which maximizes the lensing parameters . in the case of varying @xmath143 the further the source is the greater @xmath137 and @xmath97 are . for instance , in the case of abell 370 with @xmath160 , @xmath161 for @xmath162 and about 1.5 when @xmath158 is only 0.2 ( @xmath163 )  that is , @xmath137 and @xmath97 for far away sources are not much larger than for sources at redshifts of about unity . 
 the behaviour of @xmath138 with redshift is evidently more complex - as @xmath137 and @xmath97 slide along the line of proportionality  ( [ kgprop ] ) in @xmath137@xmath97 plane the variance first increases from zero at its bottom left corner but can then , depending on @xmath147 and @xmath148 cross one or two ` zero - signal ' lines @xmath139 . actual @xmath164 convergence and shear in abell 370 and abell 2218 
 for which we have detailed density maps @xcite cover approximately the range present on figure  [ epsilonmufig ] therefore there is no much point in discussing how @xmath138 changes with redshift any further , specially since the measurements of the redshift have been performed for many of the potential targets for surface brightness variability observations . 
 however , it is worth noting the general pattern of brightness variability behaviour over the area of some of the most prominent candidates for this sort of observations - gravitational lensed arcs . 
 these objects often consist of two or more sections with critical lines between these sections and , in the case where there is no smooth matter , the variability will be most easily observed in the pixels further away from the critical lines on which @xmath165  and variability  vanish . 
 when compact objects make up only a limited fraction of the lensing matter  which is expected to be the case  the situation is more interesting . 
 let @xmath166 be the compact objects share in the total convergence , so that @xmath167 and @xmath168 
 . then the effective convergence and shear are @xmath169 and @xmath170 . 
 the factor @xmath171 in @xmath172 is then : @xmath173 ^ 2-\gamma^{\prime 2}}{|1-(1-x)\kappa_{tot}|^2 }    }    \hspace{0.1cm}\nonumber    \\   &    & = \frac{1}{[1-(1-x)\kappa_{tot}]^2}\left\{\matrix{(1-\kappa_{tot})^2-\gamma^{\prime 2}\cr [ 1-(1 - 2x)\kappa_{tot}]^2-\gamma^{\prime 2 } \cr}\right . \label{dissolve}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the latter alternative determined by whether @xmath174 is less ( top ) or greater ( bottom ) than @xmath175 . 
 therefore , the outer lines of the zero variability signal ( those which correspond to @xmath176 and therefore @xmath177 ) are not affected by the addition of smooth matter . 
 other zero line positions depend on the value of @xmath166 and this dependence represents a potential means to determine this value . 
 we will see that only highly magnified pixels show variability detectable with present - day observational techniques 
 i.e. , those lying near the critical curves , and therefore for the effect to be detectable these curves should not coincide with the lines of zero variability . 
 thus , the condition @xmath178 or , since @xmath174 can be determined from macrolensing modeling : @xmath179 is in practice necessary to observe the effect . for 
 axially symmetric clusters , the arcs which form on the second ( inner ) critical curves tend to have radial morphology , i.e. their dimensions along the critical curve  and thus the number of highly magnified pixels  are small .    as an example 
 we have computed the maps of the signal @xmath180 for two well - studied clusters - abell 370 and abell 2218 ( see @xcite and references therein ) and present them in figures [ e370 ] and [ e2218 ] . 
 these are given for two values of the source redshift @xmath181 for both clusters and @xmath182 and @xmath183 for abell 370 and abell 2218 , respectively . 
 the latter two correspond to giant gravitational - lensed arcs seen in the clusters while the former are given for comparison . as new instruments  like _ james webb space telescope _ 
 ( jwst , formerly known as ngst )  come into operation 
 they are expected to observe many more lensed galaxies behind these clusters and @xmath181 maps show how the signal might look for them . 
 each of the maps is given for two values of @xmath166 with 100 and 20 per cent of convergence contained in compact objects . 
 these values of @xmath166 are assumed to be constant over the maps .            in figure  [ ra ] 
 we show the contour lines of the microlensing signature @xmath138 superimposed on the optical image of the radial arc r in abell 370 obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) @xcite . the source redshift here is estimated to be @xmath184 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . 
 the regions between the thick white lines correspond to ` zero signal ' lines where @xmath185 , while the regions between the thick black lines  where present  have @xmath186 , where the analysis given in this paper is not applicable . 
 dashed white lines show the location of the critical curve . 
 the figure illustrates how the signal changes with varying fraction of compact objects in the overall mass budget . 
 perhaps in contrast to naive expectations , the signal generally increases when the density of compact objects is decreased because of the magnification effect by the smooth matter distribution . 
 this can be understood on the basis of  ( [ itutti ] ) : the dependence of the variability extent on the source size is rather modest while slight changes in the smooth matter convergence @xmath82 change the @xmath187 factor in the definition of effective shear and convergence of the compact matter @xcite significantly when @xmath82 is about unity which is a common place for macrolensed images of distant sources ; thus convergence and shear on the @xmath188 plane of fig.[epsilonmufig ] can assume high values . 
 this somewhat surprising behaviour has also been discussed by @xcite while @xcite give a detailed explanation of this effect . 
 more important is the change in zero signal lines pattern that can be readily probed in observations and can provide , via  ( [ dissolve ] ) , an interesting constraint on the compact object contribution to the overall convergence determined by modeling of the lensing potential .    for images which do not lie on the critical lines observations can still be of interest for the determination of @xmath166 through studying the variability pattern in greater detail and comparing it to the predicted one . 
 however , for the two clusters investigated in this paper the latter possibility remains mostly a theoretical one because of observational limitations . 
 let us now discuss the prospects for the detection of the considered effect . 
 we will consider observations with _ 
 hubble space telescope _ as a reference point in this section although it will be clear that observations of this effect with hst in the two clusters under investigation is impractical . 
 observations with more advanced instruments , such as _ james webb space telescope _ or the proposed 30-metre telescope ( also known as celt ) could , however , be used to observe the microlensing - induced variability . 
 the number of photons @xmath189 detected in a unit time interval in a pixel from a source of observed luminosity @xmath69 ( uncorrected for lensing magnification ) is determined by the luminosity distance to the source @xmath190 , the energy distribution in its spectrum @xmath191 ( such that @xmath192 ) and the telescope efficiency @xmath193 and diameter @xmath194 : @xmath195    these photons will be accompanied by @xmath196 background photons . for hst wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and actual luminosities observed in pixels of gravitationally lensed galaxies , the noise is dominated by poissonian fluctuations in count numbers . at @xmath197 the coefficient in  ( [ photonsinpixel ] ) is @xmath198 while the background level is about @xmath199 photons in a pixel per hour ( this value changes by about @xmath200 depending on the source heliocentric ecliptic longitude ) . 
 let us now calculate the time @xmath201 required to detect the fractional change of @xmath202 in a pixel with given microlensing parameters @xmath138 , @xmath203 at a signal - to - noise level @xmath204 ; @xmath34 here determines the fraction of pixels deviating from the mean at @xmath202 level via the normal law @xmath205 and we will use @xmath206 for numerical estimates which is close to the optimal value . 
 the signal @xmath207 is @xmath208 while the noise @xmath68 is determined by poissonian fluctuations @xmath209 the factor of 2 in the latter expression comes from the fact that we need to compare two images from different epochs . in most cases @xmath210 can be neglected for noise estimation . 
 equation  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) shows that signal and noise behave similarily which , as can be easily seen , gives the following expression for the time required : @xmath211 thus , it is determined mostly by the telescope and geometry ( through @xmath212 ) and lensing characteristics of the pixel ( through @xmath138 and @xmath203 ) while the dependence on photometry is very weak as soon as the background value is exceeded by the source surface brightness and increases inversly proportional to the latter if it is lower than the sky level . 
 in fact , the surface brightness of a typical galaxy at @xmath213 is of order @xmath214 per sq.arcsec and scales as @xmath215 with @xmath216 depending on the spectrum ; surface brightness is conserved in gravitational lensing . 
 the sky background outside the earth s atmosphere varies in the range of @xmath217 per sq.arcsec and is about half a magnitude higher for the best terrestial observatories . 
 therefore , typical values of the numerator in the last fraction of  ( [ exposuretime ] ) is of order 1 for nearby galaxies and grows rapidly as the redshift exceeds unity .    combining values of coefficients in  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) and  ( [ photonsinpixel ] ) 
 we find that for observation of the radial arc in abell 370 with hst wfpc2 the value of the first fraction in  ( [ exposuretime ] ) is approximately @xmath218 . 
 the value of the variability power parameter @xmath74 does not exceed @xmath219 ( in fact , @xmath74 changes very slowly with convergence after it exceeds approximately @xmath220 ) while the ratio of sky background to the observed arc surface brightness @xmath221 for most pixels is about @xmath222 @xcite .    therefore the effect can be most easily observed in pixels of high magnification @xmath203 . 
 this value does not depend on the compact - to - smooth convergence ratio , and peaks at the critical curve . 
 the variability @xmath74 , on the contrary , follows the compact matter distribution and wherever some smooth matter is present , can preserve high values at the regions of high magnification . as can be seen from  ( [ dissolve ] ) this 
 is the case when the local convergence value is greater than the inverse of the smooth matter share @xmath223 , or @xmath224 ; otherwise the variability zero lines coincide with the critical curves and it is not possible to get both appreciable variability and high magnification values . 
 somewhat ironically , the compact objects can only be observed when their mass contribution is sufficiently low . 
 magnification values are determined firmly by the present - day advanced methods of mass distribution modeling in lensing clusters which proved to be accurate as well as highly and successfully predictive @xcite . 
 the values of convergence for the radial arc r in abell 370 span a range of approximately 1.3 to 1.4 and therefore the maximum values of the fraction of compact matter which produce detectable signal would be approximately 23 to 30 per cent  values close to those suggested by studies of the galaxy and its immediate neighbourhood @xcite . 
 all other gravitationally lensed objects in the cluster either lie on the outer critical curves ( e.g , the giant gravitationally lensed arc a0 ) or do not show sufficient magnification values .    for the map of variability present on figure  [ ra ] with @xmath225 , the values of @xmath74 on the arc are about four while the magnification varies from a few dozen to a few hundreds with a handful of pixels where @xmath203 exceeds @xmath226 . 
 therefore , according to eqn . 
 ( [ exposuretime ] ) , for most pixels detecting variability at signal - to - noise ratio @xmath227 with hst would require considerable integration time of a few hundreds to a few thousands hours . 
 however , for a few pixels these exposure times will have more reasonable values of order ten hours . 
 certain reservations should be made reflecting the fact that these values are dependent on the model and in this respect the distribution of the magnifications ( or the derived required exposure times ) is a more robust measure . 
 however , one should keep in mind that the critical curve is necessarily a set of points with infinite magnification and therefore the number of variable pixels is determined by the length of the arc along the critical curve ( which is rather small for radial arcs ) and the rate at which magnification falls off the critical curve 
 i.e. , graduality in convergence and shear values over the image in the critical curve vicinity . 
 to estimate the latter value , we can rewrite  ( [ exposuretime ] ) : @xmath228 where @xmath229 which is about @xmath230 for the radial arc r observed with hst . 
 factor @xmath231 vanishes at the critical curve , and to the first order approximation , t as a function of the coordinate @xmath194 orthogonal to the critical curve is @xmath232 hence , the width of the strip along the critical line on which the required integration time @xmath201 is less than a given value @xmath233 is simply @xmath234 for the patch of the critical curve near the radial arc with @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath206 one gets @xmath240 for hst . 
 multiplied by the dimension of the arc along the critical curve ( about five for the radial arc r in abell 370 ) , these give the required number of pixels . 
 it is immediately clear from this estimate that since integration time of more than 100 hours is hardly possible , only local ( on inter - pixel scale ) stationary points in @xmath231 can give detectable signal for hst images  the above mentioned strip itself is too narrow . 
 one would need more advanced telescopes to observe the effect , such as jwst or celt ,  or explore other lensing clusters where strongly lensed objects on inner critical curves are seen .    at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , 
 the sky background level expected to be observed with jwst is not much different from that with hst and therefore changes mostly come from differences in the optics and spectral band via the value of @xmath212 in eqn . 
 ( [ exposuretime ] ) . using the jms sensitivity calculator 
 we estimate that the exposure time required for the _ near - infrared camera _ of jwst to detect the signal will be about 15 to 20 times as short as those of hst 
 . however , even this would require exposure times of several dozen hours as @xmath241 in this case . 
 in light of the recent discovery of a candidate @xmath242 lensed galaxy behind abell 1835 @xcite , it does not seem implausible that such ultra - deep exposures with jwst will be attempted . 
 for the radial arc in abell 370 that would result in about a dozen variable pixels . 
 the proposed 30-metre telescope would make the prospects more optimistic . for a ground - based telescope 
 , the sky background will be a factor of @xmath200 higher , and the atmosphere transparency should be taken into account . 
 however , increase in collecting area over the hst will be enormous , and the net effect will be to reduce @xmath243 to about @xmath244 . 
 of further advantage would be the use of diffraction - limited mode . 
 taking into account possible tracking uncertainties , an estimate for the angular resolution of @xmath245 arcsec should be considered conservative . 
 this represents a five - fold decrease in the pixel size resulting in the ability to get closer to the critical curve . 
 thus , according to  ( [ widtht ] ) , the width of the strip around the critical curve where variability can be detected in @xmath233 hours integration time would make @xmath246 . 
 similarly , the arc length along the critical curve will be covered by five times more pixels compared to hst . 
 this means dozens of variable pixels and potential to observe the pattern of variability change both along and across the critical curve in just a few hours long exposure !     variation to be detectable at five sigma level.,width=321 ]    figure  [ histnfig ] presents the histograms of the number of pixels in the image of the radial arc seen in abell 370 which are expected to show variability detectable at the @xmath0 level as a function of integration time for jwst and celt . 
 the actual values of the arc brightness are used to determine @xmath201 from  ( [ exposuretime ] ) for every pixel which are then binned logarithmically in 0.5 dex wide bins . 
 two values of the compact matter fraction @xmath225 and @xmath247 are assumed . 
 for jwst , the pixel size and background level are taken to be equal to those for hst wfpc2 . 
 for celt , the background level is half a magnitude brighter while for the pixel size a value of @xmath248 arcsec is assumed . 
 one should bear in mind that the pixels mentioned above are variable at a detectable level , but they will only spend about one - third of the time in this ` varied ' state . 
 this fraction of time can be controlled by the parameter @xmath34 but one can see  combining  ( [ exposuretime ] ) , the normal distribution and the nearly linear histogram shape in the region of interest  that the value @xmath206 is close to optimal . 
 the time scale of variations depends on the microlens masses and motion and is of order months to years for solar masses moving with a velocity of a few hundred kilometres per second @xcite . 
 observation epochs should therefore be separated by a similar time interval . 
 we have shown in the previous section that with a few exposures on jwst or celt we expect to detect shimmering of pixels in the image of the radial gravitationally lensed arc in abell 370 due to microlensing by compact objects in the cluster . to answer the question of how such detections should be interpreted 
 let us now sketch a portrait of a typical event . 
 this would also give us an insight into what sort of contaminants could mimic variability due to gravitational microlensing . 
 the surface brightness of the arc is about seven to eight times lower than the sky background level outside the earth atmosphere . in a 30 hours - long exposure on jwst about 60 thousand ` signal ' photons will be detected in a typical pixel and around 500 thousand background photons will accompany them . 
 hence the noise , according to  ( [ noisen ] ) , is approximately ( neglecting @xmath202 ) 1060 photons and five times that is 5300 photons or about 9 percent of the original flux . as @xmath138 in this region is about 2 ( see fig.[ra]c ) , the pixel , according to  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) contains light of approximately @xmath249 stars with an intrinsic luminosity of some @xmath250 . given a typical observed luminosity of @xmath251 the magnification needed is @xmath252 , in accordance with the estimate of the previous section . 
 nine per cent variability corresponds to @xmath253 and the average value of magnification in the map is about a hundred . in the case of the average pixel , only supernova and brightest peak nova eruptions can give the true increase of @xmath254 . 
 the most significant contaminant to the average pixel is nova eruptions . 
 we can calculate the expected number of nova explosions in a way similar to that of @xcite  for a galaxy similar to the milky way the rate of nova explosions is expected to be @xmath255 eruptions per star per year . 
 eruption durations  by which we mean the period of time novae stay above the level of interest @xmath256  is only a fraction @xmath257 of a year , long compared to the integration time while short compared to the interval between exposures . 
 therefore we expect about @xmath258 erupted novae per star at any given exposure . 
 the radial arc spans around three hundred pixels and therefore the expected number of stars in it is about @xmath259 - i.e. , this is a galaxy of rather modest size . 
 thus , even not taking into account the multiple nature of the arc , novae are not a problem for our study . 
 clearly , supernova explositions in the source galaxy are even less of a problem . 
 an additional source of contamination is supernovae in background galaxies but , with a rate of @xmath260 sne per galaxy between two exposures ( see sarajedini , gilliland and phillips 2000 ) , they are not important . 
 however , with pixels magnified by a factor of @xmath252 which is needed to observe the microlensing variability , physical luminosity changes go down to about two thousand solar luminosities or less , and this is about the amplitude of the brightest mira variables in red bands . 
 contamination due to miras ( as well as other variable stars ) in microlensing studies is usually removed by considering observations in different spectral bands . 
 the three key signatures of microlensing origin of the variability are achromaticity , uniqueness and a symmetric form of the variations @xcite . 
 none of them is valid in the case considered in this paper . 
 achromaticity does not work for pixel lensing although in the case of low optical depth some constraints can still be applied @xcite . 
 when the optical depth is high every star in the pixel at any given moment is subject to strong microlensing and this fact does not allow to use achromaticity constraint . 
 for the same reason the uniqueness of the microlensing event does not work any more . with regards to the symmetry , we do not observe individual light curves in this case and therefore can not use this constraint at all . 
 however , although we can not use achromaticity for individual pairs of measurements , this property is still valid in a statistical sense . 
 namely , the variability extent seen in different bands is , according to  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) , proportional to @xmath261  the value which does not change much from one band to another , is closely related to the magnitude of the surface brightness fluctuations and can be determined in observations of nearby galaxies which are definitely not lensed . in contrast , ( absolute ) variability amplitude of variable stars is strongly dependent on the spectral band and , for instance , in miras the change ranges from thousands solar luminosities in k band to hundreds and even tens of solar luminosities in bluer bands . 
 are too faint to affect the fluxes of pixels containing thousands of stars .    contamination due to variable stars is a more serious issue for observations with celt . 
 an analysis similar to the one given above , shows that typical intrinsic luminosities of pixels with variability detectable in a one hour long exposure amount to just around @xmath262 solar luminosities with typical variability extent of around 70 per cent or around @xmath263 solar luminosities . 
 this is a range at which various variable stars may contribute to the observed variability . 
 the only way to distinguish it from the variability due to gravitational microlensing by compact dark matter in the cluster seems to be to use the behaviour of variability from one pixel to another and across spectral bands to see whether it is consistent with physical variability or gravitational microlensing hypotheses . 
 one of the remaining problems is how to tell the difference between no compact matter and too much compact matter in the case of a null signal detection . 
 more work needs to be done on this question and perhaps other effects should be considered to answer it . 
 however , the effect considered provides us with a lot of information on the microlensing population . 
 the gaussian approximation seems to be a simple framework for characterizing pixel microlensing in galaxy clusters and although the implications of future observations on microlensing population are not straightforward , they can provide strong constraints on the otherwise unaccessible properties of this population .

 the derivation presented here follows very closely the lines of that by @xcite . 
 we do not include all the steps of this derivation which can be found in the original work . 
 starting with the expression for the magnification factor  ( [ neindorfmu ] ) one has the following result for the observed flux of a source with surface profile @xmath264 placed at @xmath265 : @xmath266 its average value over @xmath267 is well - known to be independent of microlensing population mass distribution and source profile ( see , e.g. @xcite , chapter 11 ) @xmath268 ^ 2[(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2]|}}\hspace{-0.2cm}\\ & & = \frac{i_o}{|1-\kappa_c|^2|\det\hat{j}|}\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath269 .    the value of @xmath270 is calculated in a similar manner : @xmath271 where @xmath272 , @xmath273 . introducing the joint probability function density of @xmath274 and @xmath275 @xmath276 
 we can calculate the average value of @xmath277 : @xmath278 changing to the fourier domain and making use of @xmath279  -  functions we get : @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the fourier transform , or characteristic function , of @xmath282 and @xmath283 is the one of the source profile , which is the following for a uniformly radiating disc of radius @xmath104 emitting a total flux @xmath105 : @xmath284 we introduce central and relative coordinates @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , assume that lens positions are not correlated and take the limit of an infinite lens plane to obtain the following expression ( @xmath289 ) : @xmath290 where the @xmath279-functions in @xmath291 and @xmath292 have been utilized and for @xmath293 the following expression was obtained @xcite @xmath294 here @xmath295 and the angle @xmath113 between @xmath296 and positive @xmath297 ray equals the angle between @xmath298 and @xmath299 . 
 function @xmath300 is the mass average of @xmath301 @xmath302 the latter given by @xmath303 finally , the function @xmath304 is defined as @xmath305 and can be expressed analytically in terms of complete elliptic integrals : @xmath306k(v)+\right . } 
 \hspace{0.7cm}\\   & & \bigl.\frac{(1-x\cos\chi)(1+u)^2}{2u^2}\left[e(v)-k(v)\right]\bigr\ } \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath307 and @xmath308 . 
 the function @xmath309 is therefore easily computed numerically . 
 however , its overall behaviour is easily guessed from the following two analytic asymptotes : @xmath310 valid to the accuracy of @xmath311 per cent at @xmath312 and @xmath313 where @xmath314 is euler s constant . 
 substituting the expression  ( [ profilefourier ] ) for @xmath315 into  ( [ i2viaq ] ) , expanding @xmath316\ ] ] and using the change of variables @xmath317 we can immediately integrate over the angular component @xmath318 of @xmath319 to get @xmath320 } \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus , using expression  ( [ iav ] ) for the average value of observed flux we obtain the integral  ( [ integraly ] ) . 
 to evaluate the integral in  ( [ thebigthing ] ) we consider the asymptotes of @xmath321 which follow directly from the asymptotes  ( [ alphasmalls ] ,  [ alphalarges ] ) of the function @xmath322 introduced in the appendix a : @xmath323 with @xmath324 @xcite .        due to the assumptions on @xmath97 and @xmath104 made , in regions ( i  iii ) 
 the convergence of the integral in @xmath110 is provided by @xmath336 and @xmath337 while @xmath338 holds well for all values of @xmath110 where the integrand is any significant . 
 therefore @xmath339    in addition , in regions ( i ) and ( iii ) approximations  ( [ bsmalls ] ) and  ( [ blarges ] ) can be used , respectively . 
 the latter approximation is even better in regions ( iv ) and ( v ) but  ( [ intrho123 ] ) clearly fails there . 
 let us consider the five regions in turn :    returning to the variable @xmath340 we can write down this part of the integral as follows : @xmath341^{3/2 } } \ , .\ ] ] we can rewrite @xmath342 of  ( [ bsmalls ] ) in the following form : @xmath343 where @xmath344 and at sufficiently small @xmath54 when the logarithm term dominates @xmath166 is nearly independent of @xmath113 . 
 then @xmath345 where @xmath346^{3/2 } } \ , .\ ] ] we have found numerically that the following approximation holds for @xmath347 with an accuracy of @xmath348 per cent : @xmath349 @xmath350 stands for the point where @xmath351 reaches its maximum at a given @xmath279 . 
 this maximum value is approximately @xmath352 for @xmath353 and should be calculated directly otherwise . 
 when @xmath356 does not obey the condition just formulated , we just replace it with @xmath357 such that @xmath358 is smaller than @xmath359 and move the rest of the calculations to region ( ii ) where it is performed numerically . 
 the problem arises with @xmath360 but this corresponds to the case of diverging average amplification and the microlensing - induced variability is expected to drop logarithmically to zero in this case @xcite . 
 formally , it does happen in our calculations - @xmath171 in front of the integral  ( [ thebigthing ] ) make it go to zero linearly in all regions but ( i ) where the ratio of the determinant and denominator of  ( [ i1final ] ) tends to a non - zero limit , while @xmath361 provides the behaviour expected 
 . however , numerical calculations become unreliable in this case and so we do not calculate @xmath362 for @xmath363 closer than approximately 0.03 to the @xmath139 lines in @xmath137-@xmath97 plane . 
 another apparent problem with  ( [ i1final ] ) seems to be present when @xmath364 , but this turns out to be a slight technical issue with no real computational consequences and therefore may be called ` a removable discontinuity ' .        at @xmath368 the function @xmath369 to high accuracy and does not depend on @xmath326 . 
 therefore the integral over @xmath113 : @xmath370^{3/2 } } \label{g3def}\ ] ] ( which equals @xmath351 introduced above for @xmath371 and @xmath372 ) turns out to be a common factor and the integral with respect to @xmath326 is elementary : @xmath373    in regions ( iv ) and ( v ) the approximation  ( [ blarges ] ) is still valid , therefore @xmath374 where @xmath375 the integrand in @xmath376 decreases exponentially and therefore it is sufficient to perform a numerical integration up to some @xmath377 . 
 the absolute value of the residual can be easily estimated @xmath378 the value @xmath379 turned out to be suitable for all our purposes .    for completeness we can write down the integration in region ( iv ) , which is done numerically : @xmath380 the integration in region ( v ) is accomplished by considering the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath376 at large @xmath326 . 
 the integral  ( [ g4def ] ) effectively splits into two - with @xmath381 and @xmath382 with @xmath383 . invoking the asymptotics of bessel functions 
 one can see that the second of these integrals is proportional to @xmath384 and represents a leading term when @xmath385 . using the asymptotic formula @xmath386 and noting that the @xmath387-term oscillates rapidly for @xmath388 we find the following limiting value for @xmath376 : @xmath389 where @xmath390 this integration is again done only up to some @xmath377 . 
 we should note here that it is exactly the behaviour of @xmath394  namely the possibility to approximate it with @xmath395  in the whole region of actual dependence of @xmath396 on @xmath326 that makes the result virtually independent of @xmath104 allowing it to appear in region ( iii ) only . 
 considering the constants @xmath397 used in the actual calculations we found that the following values provide the best compromise between the accuracy of the computations and the time needed to perform them : @xmath398 , @xmath399 , @xmath400 , @xmath401 . 
 this corresponds to the case when @xmath402 which is the case actually considered . 
 we have checked that changes in these constants do not affect the results .

40,"recently we presented an approach for `` fast and accurate quantum molecular dynamics of dense plasmas across temperature regimes '' based on a carefully designed orbital - free implementation of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . 
 our orbital - free approximation retains the accuracy of the orbital - based kohn - sham method ( it reproduces the electron density to high accuracy ) , while being computationally less expensive and reaching much higher temperatures than are accessible with the kohn - sham method . 
 this was shown in @xcite for _ static _ properties , including the equation of state of hydrogen from 1 to 100 ev , as well as for the pair distribution functions of aluminum near melt and in warm dense matter conditions .    in this paper , we extend our study to the calculation of _ dynamical _ properties . to this end 
 we calculate both ionic and electronic transport coefficients , including the ion self - diffusion coefficient , the ion shear viscosity coefficient , the electrical and thermal conductivities and the reflectivity coefficient . as with the static properties , we find very good agreement with kohn - sham dft calculations . 
 moreover , the orbital - free approach provides significant relief from the computational cost temperature bottleneck of the kohn - sham method , allowing us to calculate accurately more extreme conditions . 
 this is particularly useful for the calculation of ionic transport properties , which necessitate much longer simulations than necessary for equation of state calculations . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ionictransport ] , 
 we focus on ionic transport properties and validate our method for the calculation of the self - diffusion and viscosity coefficients in hydrogen and aluminum plasmas by comparison with kohn - sham method at low temperature , and then extend those calculations to higher temperatures . in section [ electronictransport ] , we focus on electronic transport properties and consider the electrical and thermal conductivities of hydrogen and aluminium plasmas ; here , we make use of both the ionic positions and associated electron density from the orbital - free calculations as a shortcut to the orbitals required in the kubo - greenwood formalism . in both sections , we systematically compare the computational cost of our orbital - free approach with the kohn - sham method . 
 finally , special attention is given to the electrical conductivity of warm dense aluminum at 2.7 @xmath0 in view of the recent experimental determination at the linac coherent light source facility reported in @xcite . 
 we find the latter experimental conductivity results to be inconsistent with our orbital - free dft results , for which we provide further discussion . 
 the full details of the orbital - free formulation and implementation may be found in ref . @xcite and its supplemental material . applying that approach , here we calculate the ion self - diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients of hydrogen and aluminum plasmas using the standard green - kubo relations @xcite . 
 hence the self - diffusion coefficient is obtained from the time integration of the velocity autocorrelation function , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total number of ions in the simulation cell , @xmath3 is the velocity of the @xmath4 ion at time @xmath5 , and the brackets indicate the equilibrium thermal average . 
 the ionic shear viscosity coefficient is obtained by integrating the autocorrelation function of the off - diagonal component of the stress tensor , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the system volume and temperature , @xmath9 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath10 is the ionic stress tensor , given by @xmath11 the first term on the right hand side is the kinetic contribution , while the ion - ion , @xmath12,and ion - electron , @xmath13 , potential contributions are as given in ref . 
 @xcite , and depend only on the electron density and ion positions .     and lower temperatures , where comparison with kohn - sham is possible . 
 above , our results show excellent agreement with kohn - sham while thomas - fermi approach exhibits @xmath1420 - 30% difference . 
 below , we see that for hydrogen at these temperatures and densities , there is minimal difference in using lda or pbe exchange - correlation functionals . also using a nose - hoover chain thermostat @xcite , we find negligible difference with the isokinetic thermostat used in all other calculations discussed in this paper.,title=""fig : "" ]   and lower temperatures , where comparison with kohn - sham is possible . above 
 , our results show excellent agreement with kohn - sham while thomas - fermi approach exhibits @xmath1420 - 30% difference .

 very good agreement is shown with kohn - sham at lower temperatures.,title=""fig : "" ] in the range of temperatures from 1 ev to 100 ev . 
 very good agreement is shown with kohn - sham at lower temperatures.,title=""fig : "" ]    the kohn - sham calculations were performed using the quantum - espresso code@xcite at the @xmath15-point only and used a projector augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotential , while the orbital - free calculations employed a local pseudopotential as described in ref . 
 for comparison , we also show results obtained using the cruder thomas - fermi approximation . in all cases , 
 the simulations included 128 atoms in the unit cell , with time steps from 0.002 - 0.2 fs depending on temperature , and they were performed in the isokinetic ensemble@xcite . in most calculations , the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation energy was used ; other calculations were done using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation @xcite . 
 the orbital - free calculations were equilibrated for 10,000 steps and the statistics gather for 120,000 steps , while for the kohn - sham calculation 40,000 steps were completed after equilibration .    figure [ fig : htest ] shows results at density 2 g/@xmath16 and lower temperatures for which comparative kohn - sham results can be obtained . in the upper panel our results are shown to agree very well with the kohn - sham results @xcite . 
 as for the thomas - fermi approximation , it underestimates the self - diffusion by 20 - 30% at these conditions . 
 we note that the calculations were run on the same 48-core single node hardware , and the time to complete 40,000 molecular dynamics steps at @xmath17 ev for the kohn - sham and our orbital - free methods were 87.25 and 7.35 hours respectively , giving a nearly twelve times speed up for the orbital - free case . for still increasing temperature , 
 the kohn - sham approach costs more in machine memory and cpu time , while the orbital - free method has no increased cost with increasing temperature . 
 this lack of temperature scaling allows us to extend our hydrogen results to much higher temperatures . in fig . 
 [ fig : hdiff ] , we show the self - diffusion ( upper panel ) and shear viscosity ( lower panel ) coefficients for hydrogen at 2 and 8 g/@xmath16 in the range of temperatures from 1 ev to 100 ev . at the lowest temperatures of 1 and 2 ev ( and 5 ev for 8 g/@xmath16 ) kohn - sham calculations 
 are also shown for comparison and we see an agreement to within 4% of our method . 
 the self - diffusion results in general have an uncertainty of 5% , which is determined by inspection of the convergence of the kubo relation ( [ selfdiffusion ] ) . 
 the thomas - fermi approach , however , differs from our results by 15 - 20% up to 10 ev , and then gradually comes in to agreement with our results , showing a difference within 1% at 80 ev . for the viscosity coefficient , the orbital - free results agree with the kohn - sham results to a maximum error of 10% , which is within the uncertainties of the calculations which are 10 - 12% . 
 while the viscosity coefficients at 2 g/@xmath16 increase monotonically in this temperature region , the 8 g/@xmath16 case exhibits a minimum around 2 ev . 
 this is indicative of the transition from a weakly coupled to a strongly coupled plasma regime as the temperature decreases , similar to that found in the simpler one - component plasma model @xcite .       and from 0.5 to 10 ev . 
 again good agreement is shown with kohn - sham calculations at 0.5 and 1 ev . 
 a smooth fit to the orbital - free calculations is shown . ] 
 the kohn - sham calculations were performed at the @xmath15-point using 64 atoms in the unit cell , and used a 680 ev plane wave cutoff . 
 a total of 180 bands were calculated to achieve a 10@xmath18 threshold in the occupation number at 2.7 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev , and 160 bands were needed for a maximum occupation of @xmath19 at 8.1 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev . the orbital - free calculations were performed for 108 atoms on a 64@xmath20 grid . finally , the local pseudopotential for the orbital - free calculations @xcite and the paw for the kohn - sham calculations include 3 valence electrons only ; this limits the the maximum temperature permissible to about 10 ev . 
 figure [ fig : aldiff ] shows the self - diffusion results for warm dense aluminum at ambient solid density , 2.7 g/@xmath16 , and three times compression , 8.1 g/@xmath16 , in the range of temperature from 0.5 to 10 ev . as with hydrogen we see very good agreement in the self - diffusion coefficient at lower temperature where the calculations overlap . 
 however , the time for the completion of 45,000 molecular dynamics timesteps for the kohn - sham calculation at 2.7 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev was 225 hours on a 48 core node , while the time to complete the same number of steps on just 16 cores of the same machine in the orbital - free case was 13.1 hours . 
 finally we consider the case of liquid aluminum near melt . in our previous work @xcite 
 we showed excellent agreement for the ion - ion pair distribution function as compared with both kohn - sham method and experimental results . 
 following that , we examine here the self - diffusion as calculated at the experimental densities and temperatures @xcite . in fig . 
 [ fig : liqal ] our orbital - free results are plotted using both lda and pbe exchange - correlation functionals , and are compared with the the previous kohn - sham results of @xcite . in each case , the orbital - free and kohn - sham results agree closely , although the lda agreement is somewhat better than the pbe agreement . 
 we believe that this is due to lower accuracy in the pbe local pseudopotential .    here , as opposed to the hydrogen case of fig . 
 [ fig : htest ] , there is significant difference between the exchange - correlation functionals , and further neither lda nor pbe agree with the recent experimental self - diffusion results @xcite also shown in fig . 
 [ fig : liqal ] ( for more discussion , see @xcite ) . 
 it is of note our orbital - free approach captures these differences between exchange - correlation functionals , which does highlight the accuracy of our kinetic functional , as the kinetic energy contribution is typically an order of magnitude larger than the exchange - correlation contribution @xcite . 
 so far we have been able to express the ionic transport properties completely within the framework of orbital - free dft , which involves the electron density only . however when considering electronic transport coefficients , transitions between quantum states of the system must be considered and it is necessary to return to a description in terms of kohn - sham orbitals . to this end 
 , our approach is to first perform an orbital - free calculation from which ionic configurations and corresponding electron densities are selected at a subset of time steps along the simulation . 
 ( recall that in @xcite we showed that the densities obtained using our orbital - free approach are in very good agreement with those obtained with a self - consistent kohn - sham calculation . ) then , for each ionic configuration and electron density , the kohn - sham potential is readily calculated and the single - particle kohn - sham spectrum of eigenstates is calculated by diagonalization of the single - particle kohn - sham equation . 
 the spectrum is then used to calculate the electrical @xmath10 and thermal @xmath21 conductivities by evaluating the kubo - greenwood formula ( see @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath22 where the frequency - dependent onsager coefficients are given by @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the momentum operator , @xmath25 is the specific @xmath26-point in the brillouin zone , @xmath27 and @xmath28 label the band index , @xmath29 are the single - particle energies , and @xmath30 are the single - particle occupations determined through the fermi - dirac distribution . 
 additionally @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron charge and mass and @xmath33 is the average electron enthalpy per electron . 
 lastly is the @xmath34 function , which is approximated by a lorentzian function ( see details in appendix [ appendix1 ] ) due to the discreteness of the energy levels . 
 ( decreasing from top to bottom curves ) from 1,000- 2,000,000 k. for reference , we compare with the prediction of the kitamura - ichimaru model @xcite.,title=""fig : "" ]   ( decreasing from top to bottom curves ) from 1,000- 2,000,000 k. for reference , we compare with the prediction of the kitamura - ichimaru model @xcite.,title=""fig : "" ]    finally , for each ionic configuration , @xmath10 and @xmath21 are calculated and then averaged over all sampled configurations to obtain a converged result . 
 the reflectivity coefficient @xmath35 is then obtained from the frequency - dependent electrical conductivity @xmath36 ( see appendix [ appendix2 ] ) . 
 the main difference of our approach from a full kohn - sham calculation is that we use the density from the orbital - free calculation in order to calculate the kohn - sham potential and then find the single - particle orbitals and occupation numbers by a single diagonalization as opposed to a fully self - consistent kohn - sham calculation which may require 10 - 20 diagonalization steps or more depending on the initial guess . 
 this then decreases our computation time by at least an order of magnitude @xcite .      . 
 previous kohn - sham and experimental results at the liquid density agree with our calculations.,title=""fig : "" ] + .

 previous kohn - sham and experimental results at the liquid density agree with our calculations.,title=""fig : "" ]    we have performed calculations for hydrogen plasmas from 1 - 10 g/@xmath16 and temperatures from 1,000 - 2,000,000 k. as discussed in @xcite convergence with respect to the number ions , the number of @xmath26-points and the width of the lorentzian smearing is critical . 
 we have used 96 atoms for all calculations , except at 2,000,000 k where we used 40 atoms . at 1,000,000 k 
 we performed calculations with 40 and 96 atoms and found no difference in results . for higher densities and lower temperatures 
 a @xmath37 @xmath26-grid was required , moving to higher temperatures a @xmath38 grid and finally @xmath15-point only calculations were sufficient . 
 a lorentzian smearing of 0.1 ev was also adequate ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) . 
 the results for the electrical and thermal conductivities @xmath10 and @xmath21 are plotted in fig . 
 [ fig : hcond ] . 
 we find that our results agree well with the previous calculations of ref . 
 @xcite and ref . 
 @xcite for both @xmath10 and @xmath21 . 
 we also find good agreement with the deuterium results ( at twice mass density ) of ref . 
 @xcite for @xmath21 . here 
 though we are able to complete calculations in the direction of lower densities and higher temperatures than in those previous works which is where the kohn - sham method becomes more computationally expensive . 
 we have calculated the electrical and thermal conductivities and the reflectivity coefficient of warm dense aluminum from 0.1 - 10 ev at solid density ( 2.7 g/@xmath16 ) and at the ambient liquid melt density of 2.35 g/@xmath16 . 
 here we found a much smaller width in the lorentzian smearing , 0.015 ev , was required for convergence of the calculations which all used 64 atoms and a @xmath38 @xmath26-grid except at 10 ev which used only the @xmath15-point . also the 3-electron local pseudopotential used here limits us to temperatures less than 10 ev . 
 the results of our calculations are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : alcond ] together with previous results , including three independent experimental measurements . 
 our orbital - free results at 2.35 g/@xmath16 for @xmath10 and @xmath21 are in very good agreement with previous kohn - sham calculations of recoules _ et al . 
 _ @xcite and with the experimental results @xcite . 
 similarly , our results for the reflectivity agree very well with the experimental measurement near 1 ev reported in @xcite ( the experimental point is shown with the error bar representing the dispersion over the experimental frequency range ) . by extending the previous kohn - sham calculations to higher temperature , we find a minimum in the electrical conductivities at about 6 ev , while the reflectivity coefficients show an exponential decrease with temperature . 
 similar trends are seen for the @xmath10 and @xmath35 at 2.7 g/@xmath16 . 
 @xcite are not consistent with dft calculations and other experimental measurments . ] 
 surprisingly , while our results at 2.35 g/@xmath16 are in agreement with previous experiments , our electrical conductivities at 2.7 g/@xmath16 are inconsistent with the experimental determination recently reported by sperling _ 
 _ at temperatures 0.2 ev and 6 ev @xcite ( as reported in the text of their paper ) . 
 this is clearly shown in fig . 
 [ fig : alcond100 ] where we reproduce the results of fig . 
 [ fig : alcond ] for the electrical conductivity together with the result of sperling _ et al . _ and other results discussed below . 
 the `` improved born model '' calculation is also reported in sperling _ 
 et al . _ and 
 , while it was described there as in satisfying agreement with the experiment , this model is also in disagreement with our calculations . 
 our calculations are also inconsistent with the recent results of faussurier _ et al . _ 
 @xcite based on an average - atom ( aa ) model , which find a minimum around 20 - 30 ev , significantly higher to the value of @xmath146 ev that we find . 
 on the other hand , our results are consistent with other kohn - sham calculations at 1 and 2 and 2.35 g/@xmath16 by desjarlais _ 
 _ @xcite and recoules _ et al . _ 
 @xcite , which show a clear trend of increasing conductivity with density in this temperature region . to the contrary , 
 the lower temperature point of sperling _ et al . 
 _ even at full extent of the error bars falls between the 1 and 2 g/@xmath16 dft calculations . 
 additionally , an experimental point from the exploding wire experiments of benage _ et al . _ 
 @xcite at 1.95 g/@xmath16 , shows a conductivity a little lower than suggested by the dft but within the error . 
 we have applied our recently - published orbital - free approximation of finite - temperature density functional theory to the calculation of ionic and electronic transport properties of dense plasmas from cold to hot conditions . 
 we have shown that our approach retains the level of accuracy of the orbital - based , kohn - sham calculations , as was previously shown for the static properties @xcite . moreover 
 , the reduction of the temperature bottleneck which exists in the kohn - sham method allows us to calculate these properties at a fraction of the computational cost of kohn - sham calculations , and further to complete calculations where kohn - sham is simply computationally prohibited . 
 the present results lend support to orbital - free quantum molecular dynamics as a viable approach that can significantly contribute to the theoretical exploration of matter under extreme conditions , especially when thermodynamic and transport properties are needed over a wide range of physical conditions of temperatures and densities . 
 further work is needed to develop this approach to its full potential . 
 indeed , at present , our own orbital - free method is limited to conditions where the gradients in the electron density are small enough to be consistent with the assumption made in the construction of the density functional ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) . as a consequence , 
 its applicability is limited to `` simple '' enough systems , such as hydrogen plasmas at large enough densities ( @xmath39 2 g/@xmath16 ) , dense aluminum below 10 ev ( which can be modeled with a 3-electron pseudopotential ) , or very hot plasmas in which case the thomas - fermi approximation is adequate . 
 consideration of more `` difficult '' conditions involving larger density gradients , such as aluminum calculations to temperatures above 10 ev , or of other elements that are less free - electron like , require further developments of orbital - free functionals . 
 potential research areas include the search for advanced orbital - free functionals of higher order in the density gradients @xcite ; the development of accurate local pseudopotentials , as the transferability of the current pseudopotentials across densities and temperatures remains an issue , and for some elements and conditions they have been simply unattainable ; the development of density functionals with a density decomposition , such as has been explored for transition metals at zero temperature @xcite . 
 further , here we have made use of the highly accurate electron density available in our orbital - free dft to determine the kohn - sham potential and then obtain the kohn - sham orbitals by a single diagonalization which significantly reduces the computational time for high temperature calculations of the electrical and thermal conductivities through the kubo - greenwood linear response theory . 
 of course , this reliance on a calculation of kohn - sham orbitals for the evaluation of the conductivities is now the limiting factor . 
 development of an orbital - free approach which does not resort to calculating the kohn - sham orbitals , but retains the kubo - greenwood accuracy would be a significant advancement for the field , from computational and aesthetic viewpoints .

 [ fig : alconv ] the convergence of the electrical and thermal conductivities are examined with respect to @xmath15 for the case of aluminum at 2.7 g/@xmath16 and 5 ev .    in the case of hydrogen , we found 96 atoms sufficient down to our lowest temperatures at all densities . 
 however , a 3 @xmath44 3 @xmath44 3 @xmath26-grid was needed up to 20,000 k at 10 g/@xmath16 , but only up to 5,000 and 2,000 k at 5 and 2 g/@xmath16 , and at 1 g/@xmath16 at 1000 k 
 a 2 @xmath44 2 @xmath44 2 @xmath26-grid was sufficient . 
 we were able to use only the @xmath15-point for temperatures down to 232,000 k at 1 and 2 g/@xmath16 and down to 1,000,000 k at 5 and 10 g/@xmath16 . 
 for the hydrogen conductivity calculations we included 450 bands at all densities and 1,000 k. while at 1,000,000 k we used 3,000 bands at 10 g/@xmath16 and 5,000 bands at 1 g/@xmath16 .

41,"air temperature is a measure of how hot or cold the air is . 
 the knowledge of the mean air temperature of the future seasons is very helpful for individuals , but even more for organizations whose workers and machines have to operate outdoors ( agriculture , armed force , railways , maintenance of roads , tourism , etc . ) and for gas and electricity companies . 
 the seasonal temperature values , in fact , have a great economic impact for both organizations and companies , and their prediction would allow a more efficient activity planning . 
 the accurate prediction of the air temperature is very complex and usually requires a processing of a large amount of data on the weather conditions as well as the scientific understanding of atmospheric processes and their possible spatial and temporal variations  @xcite . 
 moreover , it is not possible to perform the prediction of the seasonal temperature with a minimum error for all the months and places in the world . 
 generally , the quality of seasonal forecasting has reached a good reliability over the most of the tropical regions , while the extra tropical latitudes have achieved reliable results only in certain regions ( for example , in northern america ) . 
 more specifically , in europe the predictability of temperature is quite complicated due to the variability and external influences of the local climate  @xcite . 
 however in the recent decades a considerable effort has been made to improve the understanding of physical phenomena responsible for the seasonal variability of climate parameters  @xcite .    in order to forecast the temperature that will occur in future seasons , climatological models are frequently used . 
 some of them follow an empirical approach based on several series of historical data , useful for building predictive models ; others develop a theoretical approach on complex calculations with parameters and functions that are able to understand the behaviour of the atmospheric system . 
 the first approach considers a set of minimum , maximum and mean temperatures recorded for several decades ( at least thirty years ) in representative meteorological stations in the area , while the second approach uses numerical analysis techniques which involve data observed by radiosondes , weather satellites and surface weather observations of land and oceans processed by powerful supercomputers , which are necessary because of the huge amount of data . for the latter approach , the horizontal spatial domain is global , if it covers the entire earth , or regional , if it covers only a small part of the planet . in the first approach , 
 the forecast is in somewhat approximate , although it is indicative of the future trend of the seasonal temperature in a certain area ; in the second approach the values of minimum and maximum temperature of the foreseen seasons can be estimated very reliably , because it takes into account the correlations of anomalies in the atmospheric circulation at large scale . 
 however , it is difficult for operators to arrange the numerical approach on a smaller scale for planning purposes .    in order to make the forecasting of foreseen seasonal temperatures less sophisticated , in this work 
 two soft computing methods are applied : artificial neural networks ( anns )  @xcite and genetic programming ( gp )  @xcite .    as ann 
 we use a feedforward multi layer perceptron ( mlp ) neural network , a computational structure made by many processing elements ( units ) , the neurons , operating in parallel , aiming to approximate an unknown function of its inputs  @xcite . to configure the mlp 
 we use the training procedure called `` back propagation ''  @xcite . 
 it uses a subset of the data set feature vectors , each one labeled with the correct output , as examples of the correct input / output relationship . 
 artificial neural networks have already been successfully applied in different contexts  @xcite , including the atmospheric researches , such as the prediction of maximum daily precipitation  @xcite , the monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration index  @xcite and air temperature  @xcite . generally , in these works , in addition to the change of the reference framework , which can be on a local or regional scale , a wide range of parameters is used . 
 the use of parameters depends on the availability of data . 
 it is not always possible to have them at the local level as well as the reduction in a local scale of the information available at the regional scale can not be free from errors and approximations . 
 we also employ gp in order to improve the understanding of the neural method performance . 
 gp is an evolutionary computational technique proposed by koza  @xcite in order to extract automatically intelligible relationships in a system without being explicitly programmed . 
 it has been used in many applications such as symbolic regressions  @xcite , and classifications  @xcite . 
 it works by using genetic algorithms  @xcite to generate and evolve automatically composite functions , traditionally represented as tree structures  @xcite . 
 gp is then able to show the relation between input data and output data by means of an explicit formula . 
 also this soft computing method has been successfully applied to many problems of practical order  @xcite . 
 this paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we describe the application area and in section 3 the environmental data used for tuning the methods . 
 the results are reported in the experiments section . 
 the area in which soft computing techniques are applied is that of the surroundings of the town of benevento having the geographic coordinates ( lat . 
 41@xmath0 07 50 
 14@xmath0 47 13  e ) . 
 it is located equidistant from the seas and protected by the hills located in the west that is an inner area of the italian peninsula . 
 therefore , the area of this application is not affected by maritime influences , nor by winds coming from the west . 
 nevertheless , its geographic location falls in the context of a mediterranean climate with a tendency to continental features . more specifically , along the italian peninsula it is observed , in winter , the interaction between the area flows from the northwest and west and those who move from the east , which causes heavy rains , while in summer the presence of subtropical anticyclone determines a prolonged drought interrupted by sporadic thunder phenomena . 
 the north - western winter air streams can bring down the minimum temperature to a few degrees above zero , and the maximum in summer exceeds 30@xmath0c . 
 this synoptic situation is made evident by the data recorded in the meteorological station of benevento  @xcite . 
 it is located in the hilly area , which characterizes the territory surrounding this town , at 144 m a.s.l . 
 although it has recorded rainfall and temperature data since 1882 , the official ones published on the hydrological annals are available only from 1925 until 1998 with occasional missing data . 
 the decommissioning of the benevento station forced us to examine the data of another site , at a distance of less than twenty kilometers north - west from benevento . 
 so the data corresponding to the last 13 years come from the castelvenere station ( lat . 
 41@xmath01415n ; long . 
 14@xmath03316e ) , that is located in a similar geographical position ( 140 m a.s.l . ) and it presents a minimal difference with the data of temperature and precipitation recorded in benevento . 
 however , in order to avoid mistakes , these data have been scaled according with this difference . in both stations , for each year the available data are the daily minimum temperature , the daily maximum temperature , the daily mean temperature , the daily amount of rainfall and the number of rainy days that occurred during each month .    in order to better show the weather characteristics of the area , we provide some information obtained from the considered series . 
 the mean maximum temperature recorded during the summer season varies from 25.6@xmath0c to 32.1@xmath0c . 
 the mean minimum and maximum value has been reached respectively in 1976 and 1928 . 
 the mean minimum temperature in the winter season ranges from a low of -0.8@xmath0c in 1982 to a maximum of 7.8@xmath0c in 1979 . 
 also in 1982 , the highest annual temperature range of 31.1@xmath0c was reached , although the yearly mean temperature remains below 17@xmath0c . 
 the daily mean temperature is slightly below 15@xmath0c .    just to complete the data relating to the maximum temperatures recorded in the last decades 
 , castelvenere station shows a tendency to increase with peaks that have exceeded abundantly 40@xmath0 during summer months , whereas in the same station the minimum temperature has gone down to 7@xmath0 below zero during the winter months . 
 the mean maximum temperature of the summer months is within the same range defined before , but basically the values are higher . 
 even the mean minimum temperature of the winter months falls between the extremes defined at a general level , however , it should be noticed that it is not unusual to have periods of more than one week with temperatures below zero ( 2009 and 2012 ) . as for precipitations 
 , it can be seen clearly in the annual distribution of the data that they are highest in autumn and winter seasons and at a minimum in the summer . in particular 
 , the range of the annual precipitation varies from a minimum of 256 mm in 2003 to a maximum of 1127 mm in 1955 , with an average value which is near to 800 mm . 
 the largest quantities were mainly recorded in the autumn months ( nearly 600 mm in 2010 and over 500 mm in 1966 ) , while the lowest ones were recorded in the summer months ( 20 mm in 2000 and 21 mm in 1987 ) . 
 this effect is confirmed by the frequency of rainfall , which sees a concentration of rainy days in the autumn months ( 56 rainy days in 2002 ) , in contrast to summer months in which it is reduced dramatically , as in the months of the beginning of this century with one day in 2000 . 
 in the proposed application we want to predict the mean seasonal temperature of the subsequent years . 
 therefore , a number of parameters ( features ) to assess the seasonal conditions of this area are calculated from the available data from 1925 to 2012 . 
 such parameters are then used for the prediction . according to the data availability in the series of the meteorological stations in benevento area , we consider 9 features :    ll feature & range + year @xmath1 & from 1925 to 2012 + season @xmath2 & winter , spring , + & summer , autumn + mean seasonal temperature @xmath3 & c degrees + mean seasonal of daily maximum temperatures @xmath4 & c degrees + mean seasonal of daily minimum temperatures @xmath5 & c degrees + mean yearly temperature @xmath6 & c degrees + 
 mean seasonal rainfall @xmath7 & mm + number of seasonal raining days @xmath8 & positive integer + mean seasonal temperature in the next year @xmath9 & c degrees +    [ ta1 ]    with the exception of the season @xmath2 all the features are expressed as numeric variables . 
 they should contribute to the prediction of seasonal mean temperature of the year following the year in progress . 
 in addition to temperature values , which express the most features used , two sets of data concerning the precipitation are considered . 
 they have been inserted in the input data , since the temperature is to be put in relation to the general circulation and disturbances that could be incurred . in some cases 
 the occurrence of rainfall can be enforced by local situations , such as mountain range and vegetation , which determine the amount of moisture in the air . 
 such amount is to be put in relation with the temperature that is observed . 
 furthermore , rainfall is also related to the number of rainy days , useful to detect the frequency with which this phenomenon occurs . 
 missing data are restricted to the period of the second world war ( 1942 1948 ) and the failure of the stations for certain periods ; however , this has not compromised the quality of information used for the application . to obviate these data , 
 it has not been made any interpolation , while for the data of the second station an appropriate correction has been introduced taking into account the local influences on the recorded data ( different exposure to the solar radiation , moisture conditions , etc . ) . 
 the resulting dataset is composed of 248 labeled examples , where each example has the following structure @xmath10 
 according to the 10-fold cross - validation methodology @xcite , the whole data set has been partitioned into 10 non overlapping subsets . of these 10 subsets , one can be chosen to evaluate the neural network performance ( validation set ) , and the remaining 9 can be used to instruct it ( training sets ) , i.e. setting the network weights . 
 this procedure has been repeated 10 times , corresponding to all possible choices of the validation set and the corresponding average performance has been gauged in terms of an average % -misclassification error . 
 cross - validation is important in testing hypotheses suggested by the data , especially where further samples are costly or impossible to collect .    for our experiments we adopted an excel - based system which simulates a neural network developed by angshuman saha , that is freely available all over the web . 
 by using this tool , we can define feed - forward back - propagation networks with 1 or 2 hidden layers , enter training data , set various learning parameters , start a learning phase and see the results ( e.g. error rate ) presented in various ways , for example graphically ( see fig . 
 categorical values are automatically converted into numerical ones . 
 the weights @xmath11 are initially randomly chosen in a fixed range . 
 the error back propagation algorithm has several parameters , and the most important ones are called , respectively , `` learning rate '' and `` momentum term '' . 
 the first term is a measure of the influence degree , in the formula for updating weights , of the error term , whereas the latter one determines the influence of the past history of weight changes in the same formula . 
 , width=404 ]    one of the most important characteristics of a mlp is the number of neurons in the hidden layer(s ) . 
 if an inadequate number of neurons are used , the network will be unable to model complex data , and the resulting fit will be poor . if too many neurons are used , the network generalizes poorly to new , unseen data . 
 so the hidden layers have been configured by a random initial choice and    * pruning , i.e. eliminating nodes , when the network learns easily the training set but shows bad performances on the validation set ; and * growing , i.e. adding nodes when the network shows bad performances on the training set .    in our case 
 the resulting architecture is made up of 8 inputs , a single hidden layer of 2 neurons , and one output . 
 the number of training cycles ( epochs ) has been fixed to 500 . 
 to value the performances , we use the error percentage resulting from the 10-fold cross - validation methodology and the coefficient of determination , denoted @xmath12 , that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable . 
 the results on the whole data set have been reported in table 2 . 
 the mean error is of 8,71% while the coefficient of determination is 0,97 , a very high value .

 the exemplars are split in two groups for training ( 90% ) and validation ( 10% ) . 
 the training set is created by randomly selecting samples from the whole dataset . 
 we use a genetic programming software tool called eureqa , for detecting equations and hidden mathematical relationships in a given data set . 
 eureqa works in order to reduce the error function given by the discrepancy between the data and the generated model  @xcite . 
 eureqa is a proprietary a.i .- powered modeling engine originally created by cornell s artificial intelligence lab and later commercialized by nutonian , inc . 
 the software uses evolutionary search to determine mathematical equations that describe sets of data in their simplest form . 
 it also allows to evidence the behaviour of each solution with respect to its size .    after about 700000 generations we found a set of solution , as reported in table 5

 in this study , two soft computing methods , as artificial neural networks , in the multi - layer perceptron @xmath40 approach , and genetic programming @xmath41 , were applied to predict next year s seasonal temperatures . in both methods we considered the same weather variables extracted from the records of two meteorological stations of benevento and castelvenere . while the traditional statistical methods need several a priori assumptions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are non - parametric tools and suitable for any situations and data sets .      as regard the application of @xmath42 , the results on the whole data set show a mean error of 8,71% with a very high value of coefficient of determination of 0,97 . if we consider only the subset 2000 - 2012 , the ten fold cross validation result is lower than 5% with the same coefficient of determination . 
 however , from a customer manager s point of view , the classification results from the @xmath42 are sub - symbolic and are often difficult to comprehend . 
 the proposed @xmath43 approach offers an explicit rule representation ( a formula ) while maintaining the low error rates and high correlation values . 
 as it has been evidenced in the last solution reported in table 5 , a formula which has a relatively low size and a rather good fitness considers just the mean yearly temperature @xmath6 of the previous year , the actual year @xmath1 and the relative season @xmath2 . 
 this solution reaches a very good performance in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath31 ( the former is 0,98% and the latter is 0,69 , as reported in table 6 ) . 
 the comprehension of the gp results has markedly improved in the next serial of tests and it has pointed out that the foreseen of seasonal temperature @xmath9 is related to the tendency of previous mean season temperature @xmath3 and subordinately to the mean yearly temperature @xmath6 ( see table 8) . 
 this result could be linked to the atmosphere circulation acting in the application area , otherwise these variables would have a higher negative sensitivity  @xcite . a major impact of the mean seasonal of daily maximum temperatures @xmath4 and the mean seasonal of daily minimum temperatures @xmath5 , as also the mean seasonal rainfall @xmath7 and number of seasonal raining days @xmath8 in the solution test 
 , would be evidence of anomalies in the atmosphere circulation ( i.e. higher content in greenhouse gas , frequent cloud burst ) . in our application , 
 developed in the area of benevento , the evolutionary trend appears almost linear , so evidencing the dominance of the natural forces . 
 probably this was to be expected for the natural and mainly agricultural land use , affecting to a lesser degree on the temperature behaviour with respect to industrial areas . 
 these good results encourage the improving of these methods , by exploring and fine - tuning the various parameters , whose exact determination may be quite complex ( e.g. temperature , pressure , moist and so on ) . in the last decade 
 these estimations have been further complicated by anthropogenic forces that make less comprehensible the behaviour of the temperature  @xcite .

42,"high - dose - rate ( hdr ) brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy in which the tumor is temporarily exposed to a highly radioactive source which dwells at different positions in or around the planning target volume ( ptv ) . for prostate tumors , 
 the dwell positions are offered by a temporary transperineal implant of catheters which run through the prostate . 
 a remote afterloader , which is connected to all the catheters , then sends a radioactive source through the catheters one by one , stopping at several dwell positions inside the ptv . 
 we assume that the catheter locations and the dwell positions are known . 
 the goal of the treatment planner is to irradiate the ptv while sparing the surrounding organs at risk ( oars ) by optimizing the dwell time at each dwell position . 
 traditionally , treatment planning was a forward process , where dwell times were adjusted until the dose distribution was satisfactory . in the last fifteen years 
 , inverse planning has been developed as a computerized technique where the dwell times are optimized according to the treatment planner s preferences on the dose distribution .    in the remainder of this introduction , 
 we explain how dose distributions are evaluated , we provide a literature review on the ongoing progress of inverse planning , and we show how this work contributes to these developments .    _ dvh criteria . _ the dose distribution within the ptv or an oar is described in a dose - volume histogram ( dvh ) . 
 such a histogram displays the percentage of the structure receiving at least a certain dose . 
 an example histogram is displayed in figure [ fig : dvhexample ] . 
 points on this histogram are denoted by @xmath0 or @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath2 is the minimum dose received in the hottest 10% of the structure under consideration and @xmath3 represents the percentage of the volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose . in a slight deviation from the above notation , @xmath4 is the maximal dose received in the structure . 
 these statistics are currently the most important quantitative evaluation criteria @xcite . 
 besides these , the treatment planner inspects the isodose lines in order to avoid undesired hot spots and cold spots . 
 table [ tab : dvhcriteria ] displays clinically used dvh criteria from a local hospital . in order to achieve tumor control , @xmath3 of the ptv 
 needs to be at least @xmath5 , i.e. , at least @xmath5 of the ptv s volume need to receive at least @xmath6 of the prescribed dose . the limitation of complications is expressed in dvh constraints on the rectum and urethra . 
 @xmath7 for the rectum imposes that @xmath5 of the rectum s tissue may not receive more than @xmath8 . a hard upper bound for tissue in the rectum 
 is set by @xmath9 . 
 for the urethra , @xmath10 is the upper bound for @xmath5 of the tissue . 
 the remaining @xmath11 are allowed to reach radiation levels of at most @xmath12 . 
 .dvh protocol for a prescribed dose of @xmath13 gy for hdr prostate brachytherapy based on @xcite . [ cols=""^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ tab : datasetdwellpos ]      dopsa has been tested on three patients . 
 since it is a random local search procedure , the result can be subject to random effects . 
 therefore , the heuristic has been run 250 times for each patient in order to provide a detailed analysis of the average treatment plan quality and the variation in quality . 
 if a low variation can be ensured for this optimization algorithm , only a single optimization run per patient will be necessary in a clinical setting to obtain treatment plans with consistent quality . 
 figures [ fig : sapt2]-[fig : sapt4 ] show the results for all three patient data sets . the average and standard deviation in ptv coverage over 250 replications 
 are displayed over the running time of 180 seconds . 
 the positioning of catheters determines the maximally achievable level of @xmath3 in the ptv , which explains the difference in objective values between patients . 
 the high dependence on catheter positioning is well observable for patient 2 for whom only solutions with @xmath14 can be attained : inspecting the corresponding ultrasound scans reveals badly positioned catheters .    in all three cases 
 , the ptv coverage increases rapidly within the first 30 seconds and further improvements on the treatment plan quality are achieved over the remaining running time . 
 every treatment plan determined by dopsa is feasible , i.e. , it always satisfies the dvh criteria imposed on the oars and dwell time constraints ( see constraints - ) . 
 the absolute standard deviations in ptv coverage after a running time of 3 minutes for each of the 250 replications are 0.09% , 0.33% , and 0.23% , respectively . therefore , dopsa delivers treatment plans with consistent quality across replications .      for the comparison with existing dvh - based optimizers 
 , we have run an milp solver with the solver settings from @xcite and we have implemented ipip @xcite . the original ipip has been extended by the dtmr to ensure a fair comparison . 
 these two methods have been run on the same three patient data sets and on the same model . 
 it is important to recognize that ipip can only provide a single solution per data set , whereas milp and dopsa continue improving the solution . 
 this is observable in figures [ fig : dvhpt2]-[fig : dvhpt4 ] , where the line for ipip remains flat after a single increase . in theory , 
 milp could stop when it proves that the solution is optimal , but this did not happen for any of the patients . 
 figures [ fig : dvhpt2 ] to [ fig : dvhpt4 ] show the average ptv coverage obtained by dopsa and the coverage obtained by the existing methods milp and ipip . 
 the running time for patient 3 has been extended to 5 minutes since milp requires more than 3 minutes to find non - zero feasible points . 
 ipip attains adequate ptv coverage within less than 6 seconds for each patient . 
 all those solutions are initially superior to treatment plans found by dopsa . over the running time of 3 minutes 
 , however , dopsa consistently outperforms ipip for all patient data sets . in each of the 250 replications for all three patients , the ptv coverage after 
 3 minutes is higher for dopsa than for ipip . 
 the average ptv coverage attained by dopsa exceeds the results by ipip after only 18 , 6 , and 12 seconds , respectively . 
 milp requires substantially more time to determine good treatment plans . for 2 out of 3 patients 
 , milp requires more than 1 minute to determine a treatment plan with non - zero ptv coverage . 
 however , after 3 minutes for patients 1 - 2 and 5 minutes for patient 3 it has found the best plan among the three algorithms .    unfortunately , the optimal objective values are not known . 
 there is still a large gap between the best solution found by any of the algorithms and the upper bound provided by the milp solver , and this gap does not decrease substantially after running the solver for a week . 
 dopsa differs greatly from the existing dose - volume based methods while it finds similar objective values . 
 this could be an indication that much better solutions do not exist . 
 the significance of the strong performance of dopsa compared to the milp by @xcite becomes apparent when closely investigating the structure of the milp - . 
 below , we show that the milp is equivalent to the well - known @xmath15-norm minimization , and that an milp solver implicitly uses a method that is known to be effective in approximating the @xmath15-norm . 
 therefore , we conclude that dopsa displays a remarkable performance by outperforming milp in terms of solution speed . 
 the objective is to maximize the number of calculation points that receive the prescribed dose of 8.5 gy . 
 let us first define the vector @xmath16 , indexed by @xmath17 in @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19 since @xmath20 is zero if calculation point @xmath17 receives at least the prescribed dose , minimizing the number of non - zero elements in @xmath16 yields a treatment plan with maximal @xmath3 . 
 the number of non - zero elements is @xmath21 ( recall that the @xmath15-norm counts the number of non - zero elements in a vector ) . @xmath2 and 
 @xmath4 can be rewritten similarly . 
 thus , the lagrangean of the milp - is equivalent to an @xmath15-norm minimization . attaining sparse vectors by minimizing the @xmath15-norm 
 has been shown to be np - hard @xcite . 
 an milp solver first solves the following lp relaxation : @xmath22,t\geq 0}\left\{\sum\limits_{i\in i_{ptv}}x_{i}:(\dot{d}t)_{i}\geq 8.5x_{i},(x , t)\in \mathcal{x}\right\ } , \label{eq : lprelaxation}\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a polyhedron . 
 substituting @xmath24 yields the following equivalent program : @xmath25,t\geq 0}\left\{\sum\limits_{i\in i_{ptv}}|y_{i}|:y_{i}\geq \tfrac{8.5-(\dot{d}t)_{i}}{8.5},(1-y , t)\in \mathcal{x}\right\}.\ ] ] so , the lp relaxation is equivalent to @xmath26-norm minimization . 
 literature , predominately in the field of image processing , suggests that an optimal solution for the @xmath26-norm minimization ( linear relaxation of the milp ) provides a good approximation of an optimal solution for the @xmath15-norm minimization ( milp ) : @xcite shows that , in most cases , the @xmath26-approximation is also the sparsest solution for underdetermined systems of equations . 
 @xcite discusses necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of @xmath15-norm and @xmath26-norm solutions in general . 
 these conditions do not hold in our case . 
 nevertheless , @xcite provide numerical evidence for the power of these @xmath26-approximations . 
 so , when the milp - is solved with an milp solver , the solver implicitly uses an approximation that is known to be accurate . 
 this explains the results by @xcite , where an milp solver quickly determines good treatment plans . 
 however , our results in section [ sec : comparison ] show that dopsa still outperforms an milp solver in finding good solutions in a short time - span , which advocates the power of dopsa . 
 compared to milp - based formulations , dopsa has another advantage . 
 when more dvh - constraints are added , the time for constraint verifications increases linearly , or sublinearly when solutions are removed in the process . 
 contrarily , both the number of variables and the number of constraints of the milp formulation grow linearly in the number of dvh criteria , which slows down an milp solver at least quadratically . 
 for example , when the lp relaxation is solved with an interior point method , the time complexity of solving the kkt system increases at least quadratically in the number of variables . a dual solver can not alleviate this slowdown since the number of constraints increases as well . 
 the existing dose - volume based optimization methods milp and ipip have not been compared before . 
 our results show that each method has its own advantages . 
 ipip is faster while milp determines a better solution . 
 dopsa , our new algorithm , is a viable alternative to both . 
 its main advantage is that it does not require a costly solver . the time it takes to determine a good solution is less than milp but slightly more than ipip . since ipip returns a single solution quickly but does not keep improving the solution , dopsa eventually determines better treatment plans . 
 this leads to two observations : first , advances in computing power will reduce the absolute time difference between both methods , making ipip lose its edge . 
 second , it is possible to combine the strength of two methods and use the ipip solution as a starting point for dopsa . 
 however , the additional costs for an lp solver required by ipip and the added complexity is not justified by the slight improvement in solution time . 
 we have disclosed all information necessary to implement dopsa . 
 we hope it receives more testing by the community , and will eventually become available to treatment planners .

43,"in @xcite , kazhdan defines the notions of -semisimplicity and -unipotence of an element of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a discretely valued locally compact field with ring of integers @xmath3 and residue field ( see the definition on p.  226 of _ loc . 
 cit . _ ) . 
 an arbitrary element of @xmath1 can be decomposed as a commuting product of an -semisimple and an -unipotent element ( see lemma 2 on p.  226 of _ 
 loc.cit._ ) . furthermore , 
 stably conjugate -semisimple elements are actually @xmath1-conjugate ( see lemma 3 on p.  226 of _ loc . 
 _ , where the result is proven for rationally conjugate elements , and lemma 13.1 of @xcite ) . 
 kazhdan uses this last result in his calculation of the @xmath4-twisted orbital integral @xmath5 ( see theorem 1 on p.  224 of @xcite , and the definition immediately preceding it ) . 
 a detailed exposition appears in @xcite*5 ; see especially  5.6 of _ loc . 
 _ an analogous result is used by waldspurger in his computation of shalika germs for @xmath6 ( see @xcite*5 ) .    in @xcite , hales defines absolute semisimplicity and topological unipotence ( the analogues of -semisimplicity and -unipotence ) for elements of unramified groups , and shows that every strongly compact element can be decomposed as a commuting product of an absolutely semisimple and a topologically unipotent element ( the topological jordan decomposition ) . 
 he then defines transfer factors on unramified groups , and shows that the transfer factor at a strongly compact element may be expressed in terms of the transfer factor for the centraliser of its absolutely semisimple part , evaluated at its topologically unipotent part ( see theorem 10.18 and lemma 13.2 of _ loc . 
 this suggests that the topological jordan decomposition is important for the fundamental lemma . 
 indeed , in @xcite , flicker uses a twisted analogue of the decomposition to prove a special case of the fundamental lemma ( see the theorem on p.  509 of _ loc . 
 the topological jordan decomposition is also useful in character computations . 
 recall that the character of a deligne  lusztig representation of a finite group of lie type is expressed by a reduction formula in terms of the ( ordinary ) jordan decomposition ( see theorem 4.2 of @xcite ) . 
 the topological jordan decomposition plays the same rle for the characters of depth - zero supercuspidal representations of @xmath0-adic groups arising via compact induction from representations which are inflations of deligne  lusztig representations of reductive quotients ( see lemma 10.0.4 of @xcite ) .    in @xcite* , as preparation for the ( positive - depth ) character computations of @xcite , adler and the author define the notion of a _ normal approximation _ of an element of a reductive @xmath0-adic group , a refinement of the topological jordan decomposition . 
 however , for the results of that paper , one needs notions of absolute semisimplicity and topological unipotence that make sense over a discretely valued field @xmath2 which is not necessarily locally compact . 
 in this paper , we offer two generalisations of these notions , the first an abstract one adapted to profinite groups , and the second adapted to the setting in which we are most interested , of reductive groups over discretely valued fields @xmath2 as above . 
 we prove the usual existence ( propositions [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] and [ prop : tjd = cpct ] ) and uniqueness ( propositions [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan ] and [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] ) results for these decompositions . 
 in the familiar case where @xmath2 is locally compact , these definitions have significant overlap ; see , for example , lemmata [ lem : top - unip ] , [ lem : abs - ss ] , and [ lem : top - jordan ] . 
 our main result , theorem [ thm : top - f - jordan - projects ] , is a strong existence result which is the analogue of item ( 7 ) in the list of properties of topological jordan decompositions given in @xcite*3 . 
 an important ingredient in its proof is an analogue of a fixed - point result of prasad and yu ( see proposition [ prop : x - depth ] ) . 
 this work has its origins in discussions with jeffrey adler during the writing of @xcite . 
 i thank him for careful reading and many useful suggestions . 
 i also thank stephen debacker and gopal prasad for helpful conversations . 
 finally , i thank the referee for many valuable comments which allowed me to improve several proofs and correct some confusing typos . 
 fix a prime @xmath0 , a hausdorff topological group @xmath7 , and a closed normal subgroup @xmath8 . note that @xmath9 is also hausdorff . for @xmath10 , we define @xmath11 . 
 an element or subgroup of @xmath7 is _ compact modulo @xmath8 _ if its image in @xmath9 belongs to a compact subgroup . 
 if @xmath8 is the trivial subgroup , we shall omit `` modulo @xmath8 '' . 
 [ defn : ilpf ] the group @xmath7 is _ ind - locally - compact _ ( respectively , _

 the main example we will have in mind of an ind - locally - compact group is the set of @xmath2-rational points of a linear algebraic @xmath2-group , where @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field ( see remark [ rem : ilpf ] ) . 
 another example is @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is a locally compact field ; the limit is taken over positive integers @xmath13 ; and , for a given @xmath13 , the map @xmath14 comes from the natural embedding of @xmath15 into the levi subgroup @xmath16 of @xmath17 .

 it is _ topologically @xmath0-unipotent _ if @xmath19 . 
 if the projection of @xmath20 to @xmath9 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple ( respectively , topologically @xmath0-unipotent ) , then we will say that @xmath20 is _ 
 absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 _ 
 ( respectively , _ 
 topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 _ ) . 
 [ rem : power - of - p - ss - unip ] any power of an absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 ( respectively , topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 ) element is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 ( respectively , topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 ) . 
 a @xmath0-power root of a topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 element is again topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 . 
 [ rem : top - p - ss - unip - cpct ] clearly , an absolutely @xmath0-semisimple element is compact . 
 suppose that @xmath18 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent and @xmath7 is ind - locally - compact . 
 then @xmath20 belongs to a locally compact subgroup of @xmath7 , so , since @xmath21 , there is some @xmath22 such that @xmath23 belongs to a compact subgroup of @xmath7 . 
 thus @xmath20 is compact . 
 [ defn : top - p - jordan ] a _ topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 _ of an element @xmath18 is a pair of commuting elements @xmath24 of @xmath7 such that    * @xmath25 , * @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 , and * @xmath27 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 . 
 we will sometimes just say that @xmath25 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 . 
 if @xmath8 is the trivial subgroup , we will omit `` modulo @xmath8 '' .    in the statement of the following result , recall that @xmath0 is _ 
 it is certainly possible for an element to have distinct @xmath0- and @xmath28-decompositions for @xmath28 a prime distinct from @xmath0 ( although it is an easy consequence of remark [ rem : intrinsic - tu ] that , if @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 , then this happens only for finite - order elements ) . 
 [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan ] suppose that @xmath18 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition @xmath25 .    if @xmath29 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 . 
 [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan_closure ] the closure of the group generated by @xmath20 contains @xmath26 and @xmath27 . 
 if @xmath32 is another hausdorff topological group , and @xmath33 is a continuous homomorphism , then @xmath34 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition .    for @xmath35 , we have that @xmath36 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition .    a special case of the above was introduced in @xcite*3 ( especially items ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the list there ) , and lemma 2 on @xcite*p . 
 we omit the ( straightforward ) proof . 
 [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] if @xmath7 is ind - locally - profinite , then an element @xmath37 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent if and only if it belongs to a pro-@xmath0 subgroup of @xmath7 . 
 if @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 , then an element @xmath18 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition if and only if it is compact . 
 suppose that @xmath7 is ind - locally - profinite . 
 note that @xmath7 is ind - locally - compact and totally disconnected . 
 denote by @xmath38 the closure of the subgroup of @xmath7 generated by @xmath20 . 
 then @xmath38 is also totally disconnected . by proposition i.1.1.0 of @xcite , if @xmath38 is compact , then it is profinite . in this case , since @xmath38 is abelian , by proposition i.1.4.3 of @xcite it has a unique sylow pro-@xmath28 subgroup for each prime @xmath28 . 
 let @xmath39 be its sylow pro-@xmath0 subgroup , and @xmath40 the direct product of its sylow pro-@xmath28 subgroups , taken over all @xmath41 . 
 then @xmath39 and @xmath40 are profinite abelian groups , of @xmath0-power and prime - to-@xmath0 order , respectively . 
 it is an easy consequence of proposition i.1.4.4(b ) of @xcite that @xmath42 .

 if ' direction of the first statement is obvious .    for the ` only if ' direction of the first statement , suppose that @xmath20 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent 
 . by remark [ rem : top - p - ss - unip - cpct ] , @xmath38 is compact . by the first paragraph of the proof , it is profinite . for any open subgroup @xmath46 of @xmath40 , we have that the map @xmath47 is an isomorphism on @xmath48 . 
 ( here , we have used commutativity of @xmath40 . ) since @xmath49 for some @xmath22 , we have that @xmath50 . 
 since @xmath46 was arbitrary and @xmath40 is hausdorff , we have that @xmath51 ; i.e. , @xmath52 . 
 since @xmath39 is closed , in fact @xmath53 ; i.e. , @xmath38 is a pro-@xmath0 group . 
 now suppose that @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 . 
 the ` only if ' direction of the second statement follows from remark [ rem : top - p - ss - unip - cpct ] .    for the ` 
 if ' direction of the second statement , suppose that @xmath20 ( equivalently , @xmath38 ) is compact . 
 by the first paragraph of the proof , @xmath38 is profinite . 
 then the intersection of @xmath40 with an open ind - pro-@xmath0 subgroup of @xmath54 is an open ind - pro-@xmath0 subgroup of @xmath40 . 
 however , @xmath40 contains no non - trivial pro-@xmath0 subgroup , so this intersection is the trivial subgroup of @xmath40 . thus @xmath40 is discrete , so finite . put @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by the first statement of the lemma 
 , @xmath27 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent . 
 since @xmath40 is finite , @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple . 
 [ rem : intrinsic - tu ] we isolate from the preceding proof a more refined , but technical , version of proposition [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] . 
 suppose that @xmath7 is ind - locally - profinite , @xmath20 is a compact element of @xmath7 , and @xmath38 is the closure in @xmath7 of the group generated by @xmath20 . 
 then @xmath38 is profinite , and we may write @xmath42 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are profinite groups of @xmath0-power and prime - to-@xmath0 order , respectively . 
 write @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . 
 then    * @xmath20 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent if and only if @xmath51 , in which case @xmath57 . 
 * @xmath20 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition if and only if @xmath58 has finite order , in which case @xmath40 is finite and we may take the topologically @xmath0-semisimple and topologically @xmath0-unipotent parts of @xmath20 to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . * if @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 , then @xmath40 is finite , so @xmath20 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition . 
 the adjective `` unipotent '' has sometimes carried several meanings ( see @xcite*3.7.1 ) . 
 we begin by defining our notion of unipotence , then give a general result , essentially due to kempf , relating the different meanings . 
 if @xmath2 is a field , is a linear algebraic @xmath2-group , and @xmath60 , then @xmath20 is _ unipotent _ if there is an embedding @xmath61 , for some @xmath62 , such that the image of @xmath20 is an upper triangular matrix , with @xmath63s on the diagonal . 
 [ lem : equiv - unip ] if @xmath2 is a field , is a connected reductive @xmath2-group , and @xmath60 is unipotent , then there are a finite separable extension @xmath64 and a unipotent radical of a parabolic @xmath65-subgroup of such that @xmath66 . 
 if @xmath65 is equipped with a topology making it a non - discrete hausdorff topological field , then there is a one - parameter subgroup @xmath67 of , defined over @xmath65 , such that @xmath68 in the @xmath65-analytic topology on @xmath69 .    since embeds as a closed subset of the affine space @xmath70 for some @xmath71 
 , we may regard @xmath69 as a subset of @xmath72 . by definition , 
 the @xmath65-analytic topology on @xmath69 is just the subspace topology . 
 this topology is finer than the zariski topology on @xmath69 . 
 by @xcite*appendix b ( especially theorem b.1 ) , it is independent of the choice of embedding .    by lemma 3.1 and theorem 3.4 of @xcite 
 , there is a one - parameter subgroup @xmath67 of such that @xmath68 in the zariski topology . 
 ( indeed , in the notation of theorem 3.4(c ) of _ loc . 
 _ , any @xmath73 will do . ) 
 there is a finite separable extension @xmath64 such that is @xmath65-split and @xmath67 is defined over @xmath65 . 
 then @xmath74 , in the notation of @xcite*p . 
 305 . by theorem 13.4.2(i ) and lemma 15.1.2(ii ) of @xcite , @xmath75 is the unipotent radical of a parabolic @xmath65-subgroup of . 
 now let be an @xmath65-split maximal torus containing the image of @xmath67 , and @xmath76 the root system of in . 
 put @xmath77 . by proposition 14.4(2)(a ) of @xcite 
 , @xmath75 is ( as a variety ) the cartesian product of the root subgroups @xmath78 of associated to roots @xmath79 . by theorem 18.7 of @xcite , there are @xmath65-isomorphisms @xmath80 for @xmath79 such that @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . 
 there are elements @xmath84 ( for @xmath79 ) such that @xmath85 . 
 now suppose that @xmath65 is equipped with a topology making it a non - discrete hausdorff topological field . by theorem b.1 of @xcite , 
 the maps @xmath86 are continuous for the @xmath65-analytic topology on @xmath69 , so @xmath87 in the @xmath65-analytic topology on @xmath69 , as desired .

 ( many of our results apply to any henselian field with perfect residue field ; but we restrict our attention slightly so that we do not have to re - prove the results of @xcite*2 in this generality . ) 
 we denote by @xmath99 the centre of ; by @xmath100 and @xmath101 the characters and cocharacters , respectively , of ; and by @xmath102 and @xmath103 those characters and cocharacters , respectively , defined over @xmath2 . if necessary , we will write @xmath104 in place of to indicate the dependence on the field @xmath2

 let @xmath111 be the ( enlarged ) bruhat  tits building of over @xmath2 and , for @xmath112 , let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be the parahoric subgroup associated to @xmath115 and its pro - unipotent radical , respectively . 
 ( in general , the parahoric subgroup may be strictly smaller than the stabiliser of @xmath115 ( but see lemma [ lem : tame - para - ascent ] ) . 
 in the language of proposition 4.6.28(i ) of @xcite , it is the _ fixateur connexe _ of the facet containing @xmath115 . ) 
 let @xmath116 be the ( not necessarily connected ) @xmath104-group such that @xmath117 for all unramified extensions @xmath118 . 
 if necessary , we will write @xmath119 in place of @xmath116 to indicate the dependence on the field @xmath2 . put @xmath120 and @xmath121 . 
 an element or subgroup of @xmath7 is _ bounded _ if its orbits in @xmath111 are bounded ( in the sense of metric spaces ) . 
 an element or subgroup of @xmath7 is _ bounded modulo n _ if its image in is bounded . 
 if @xmath123 is a torus , then denote by @xmath124 the maximal bounded subgroup of @xmath125 . 
 if is semisimple , then the building @xmath126 is canonical . in general , we `` canonify '' it as in @xcite*1.2 and 2.1 . 
 since we will be concerned almost exclusively with the case @xmath127 , this `` canonification '' will not usually be necessary . 
 [ rem : equiv - bdd ] consider a bounded element or subgroup of @xmath7 and a non - empty , closed , convex , @xmath7-stable subset s of @xmath111 . by proposition 3.2.4 of @xcite , 
 the element or subgroup fixes a point of the image of s in the reduced building @xmath128 ; hence , by boundedness , actually fixes any lift to s of . on the other hand , since @xmath7 acts on @xmath111 by isometries , an element or subgroup of @xmath7 which fixes a point @xmath112 is bounded . 
 [ rem : bdd = cpct ] if @xmath2 is locally compact , then a subgroup of @xmath7 is bounded modulo n if and only if its closure is compact modulo @xmath8 . if @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field , then an element of @xmath7 is bounded modulo n if and only if it belongs to a compact modulo @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath7 . indeed , the ` if ' direction is obvious . 
 for the ` only if ' direction , suppose that @xmath18 is bounded modulo n. then , by lemma of @xcite , there is some locally compact subfield @xmath129 of @xmath2 such that , n , and @xmath20 are all defined over @xmath129 . 
 thus @xmath20 is contained in a compact modulo @xmath130 subgroup of @xmath131 , hence _ a fortiori _ a compact modulo @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath7 . 
 [ rem : torus - filt ] if @xmath123 is a torus , then @xmath132 and @xmath133 for any @xmath134 . 
 concretely , @xmath124 is the group of elements of @xmath125 whose character values lie in @xmath135 ( by lemme 4.2.19 of @xcite ) and @xmath136 is the group of elements of @xmath137 whose character values lie in @xmath138 , where @xmath64 is the splitting field of . if is @xmath2-split , then @xmath139 ; so @xmath136 is the group of elements of @xmath125 whose character values lie in @xmath140 . 
 [ rem : ilpf ] if @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field , then @xmath141 and , by lemma of @xcite , we have @xmath142 , the limit taken over all locally compact subfields @xmath129 of @xmath2 over which is defined . 
 for such a subfield , @xmath143 is an open pro-@xmath0 subgroup of @xmath131 ( for any @xmath144 ) . 
 thus , @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 . 
 [ rem : equiv - unip ] suppose that @xmath18 is unipotent . 
 by lemma [ lem : equiv - unip ] , there are a finite separable extension @xmath64 ( which we may take , by passing to a further finite separable extension if necessary , to be a splitting field for ) and a one - parameter subgroup @xmath145 such that @xmath68 . 
 since @xmath146 is a neighbourhood of @xmath63 , there is an element @xmath147 such that @xmath148 . 
 then @xmath149 , so @xmath20 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent .      in this section 
 , we will define a @xmath151-stable subgroup @xmath152 of @xmath153 such that the map @xmath154 is an isomorphism . 
 let @xmath129 be a complete subfield of @xmath2 such that @xmath155 is unramified . 
 ( such a subfield exists , by lemma of @xcite . ) 
 if @xmath141 , then put @xmath156 . 
 we have that @xmath157 , so that the map @xmath154 is injective . by lemma 7 of @xcite , since is perfect , @xmath158 maps onto @xmath159 for every finite unramified extension @xmath160 ; so the map @xmath154 is also surjective , hence again an isomorphism . 
 note that the @xmath161th power map on @xmath152 is also an isomorphism for all @xmath62 . 
 note that , if @xmath162 is an arbitrary finite extension with maximal unramified subextension @xmath160 , then @xmath163 contains @xmath158 , and both map isomorphically onto @xmath164 ; so , in fact , @xmath165 , and we could take the union defining @xmath152 over _ all _ finite extensions @xmath162 .          if @xmath170 is a finite unramified extension , say of degree @xmath13 , then @xmath171 is separable , so there exists a primitive element @xmath172 for @xmath171 , say with minimal polynomial @xmath173 over @xmath104 . 
 since @xmath171 is separable , so is @xmath173 . 
 let @xmath174 be the unique preimage in @xmath175 $ ] of @xmath173 , and @xmath176 the unique root of @xmath174 lifting @xmath172 . 
 note that @xmath177 $ ] is a finite unramified extension of @xmath129 , hence complete . 
 suppose that there exists a subfield @xmath178 of @xmath179 , containing @xmath167 , with property ( @xmath180 ) . 
 then @xmath181 , and there is a lift @xmath182 in @xmath178 of @xmath172 , say with minimal polynomial @xmath183 over @xmath167 . then @xmath184 and @xmath172 is a root of the image in @xmath185 $ ] of @xmath183 , so @xmath183 is the preimage in @xmath175 $ ] of @xmath173 ; that is , @xmath186 . 
 thus @xmath187 , so @xmath188 $ ] . 
 note that @xmath178 lies in the complete field @xmath177 $ ] . 
 since @xmath189 $ ] clearly has property ( @xmath180 ) , we have shown that it is the unique subfield of @xmath179 containing @xmath167 with this property . 
 in particular , if @xmath170 is galois ( which is not automatic , since we have not assumed that @xmath104 is finite ) , then @xmath190 is @xmath191- , hence @xmath151- , stable . 
 put @xmath192 . by theorem 10(b ) of @xcite , if @xmath141 ( in addition to @xmath166 ) , then this definition coincides with the one given above . 
 it is easy to verify that the group @xmath152 does not depend on the choice of @xmath129 . 
 however , for @xmath166 , it _ does _ depend on the choice of @xmath167 ( and , of course , of f ) . since @xmath167 may fail to be unique ( see theorem 10(a ) of @xcite 
 ) , so may @xmath152 ; but this ambiguity seems unavoidable .      [

 if @xmath237 , then @xmath238 . by propositions 1.2(a ) , 9.1(1 ) , and 13.19 of @xcite , is a connected reductive @xmath2-group . 
 certainly , @xmath239 and @xmath240 . 
 since the image of @xmath241 in the component group @xmath242 is unipotent and has finite order , it is trivial . 
 that is , @xmath243 , so @xmath244 . 
 if @xmath245 , then , by @xcite*4.1(a ) , there is some @xmath246 such that @xmath247 .

 since an easy @xmath15 calculation shows that @xmath249 , hence that @xmath250 , we have again that is a connected reductive @xmath2-group . 
 we have @xmath251 . 
 recall that , for every finite extension @xmath64 , moy and prasad have defined ( in @xcite*2.6 and @xcite*3.2 ) , for each @xmath252 , an exhaustive filtration @xmath253 of @xmath69 by subgroups such that @xmath254 and @xmath255 for sufficiently small positive @xmath4 . since @xmath256 is a @xmath0-group for @xmath257 , we have that a topologically @xmath2-unipotent modulo n element is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 .    if @xmath18 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 , then its image in is topologically @xmath0-unipotent 
 thus it suffices to prove that , if @xmath20 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent , then it is topologically @xmath2-unipotent . 
 let @xmath212 and @xmath241 be the semisimple and unipotent parts , respectively , of the ( ordinary ) jordan decomposition of @xmath20 ; and put @xmath258 . 
 if @xmath237 , then , by remark [ rem : cent - of - ss ] , we have @xmath259 . by remark [ rem : equiv - unip ]

 since also @xmath266 for all sufficiently large @xmath13 ( by topological @xmath0-unipotence ) , we have that @xmath267 for some @xmath62 . 
 let be an @xmath65-split maximal torus in ( hence in ) such that @xmath115 belongs to the apartment of in @xmath264 . 
 by lemma of @xcite , we have that @xmath268 . 
 let @xmath218 be a finite extension such that @xmath269 . by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , 
 the character values of @xmath270 lie in @xmath271 , so the character valies of @xmath212 lie in @xmath272 , so @xmath273 . by another application of lemma of _ loc . 
 _ , @xmath274 . 
 thus @xmath212 is topologically @xmath38-unipotent . by lemma [ lem : top - f - unip - jordan ] , @xmath20 is topologically @xmath38-unipotent . 
 it is then clear from the definition ( see definition [ defn : top - f - ss - unip ] ) that it is topologically @xmath2-unipotent . 
 [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] let @xmath64 be a discretely valued algebraic extension . 
 since @xmath197 , an element of @xmath7 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n if and only if it is absolutely @xmath65-semisimple modulo n. if @xmath275 , then lemma of @xcite shows that an element of @xmath7 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent modulo n if and only if it is topologically @xmath65-unipotent modulo n. if @xmath141 , then , by lemma [ lem : top - unip ] , the topological @xmath2-unipotence and topological @xmath65-unipotence of an element of @xmath7 are both equivalent to its topological @xmath0-unipotence , hence to one another . 
 thus an element of @xmath7 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent modulo 
 n if and only if it is topologically @xmath65-unipotent modulo n.    our definition of topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions is almost the analogue one would expect of the definition of a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition ( see definition [ defn : top - p - jordan ] ) , except for one somewhat surprising condition about tori . 
 proposition [ prop : top - f - jordan - defn ] will show that this condition can be omitted . 
 * the images of @xmath212 and @xmath26 in @xmath276 belong to a common f - torus there , * @xmath25 , * @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n , and * @xmath27 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent modulo n.          suppose that @xmath277 are two topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions of an element @xmath18 . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] 
 , they remain topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions if we replace @xmath2 by a finite extension , so we do so whenever necessary . 
 since @xmath26 and @xmath278 are semisimple and commute with @xmath27 and @xmath279 , respectively , we have that @xmath280 . upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite extension , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath212 ( hence also @xmath281 and @xmath282 ) lie in @xmath7 . 
 by lemma [ lem : top - f - unip - jordan ] , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are topologically @xmath2-unipotent . 
 thus @xmath283 are two topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions of @xmath212 , so we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath20 is semisimple . 
 we show that @xmath20 , @xmath26 , and @xmath278 ( hence also @xmath27 and @xmath279 ) lie in a common torus . 
 let and @xmath284 be maximal f - tori in such that @xmath285 and @xmath286 ( hence @xmath287 ) . upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite extension , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath284 is @xmath2-split and @xmath288 . by lemma of @xcite , we have @xmath289 , so that , by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , the character values of @xmath279 lie in @xmath140 . if @xmath290 is a root of @xmath284 in @xmath291 , then @xmath292 , so @xmath293 . 
 that is , @xmath278 and @xmath279 are central in @xmath291 , hence belong to . 
 now the character values of @xmath26 and of @xmath278 , hence of @xmath294 , lie in @xmath152 ; and those of @xmath27 and of @xmath279 , hence of @xmath295 , lie in @xmath296 ; so , since @xmath297 , we have that @xmath298 equals @xmath63 . 
 it is an easy observation that , if @xmath299 is a connected reductive @xmath2-group and @xmath300 is an @xmath2-morphism , then @xmath301 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple as long as @xmath20 is . 
 although we do not do so here , one can formulate a condition on @xmath302 such that @xmath301 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent as long as @xmath20 is . 
 we record three consequences .              by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] 
 , @xmath25 is a topological @xmath309-jordan decomposition , where @xmath310 is the galois closure of @xmath64 . 
 then @xmath311 is also a topological @xmath309-jordan decomposition for @xmath312 . by proposition [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] , @xmath313 . 
 the last statement follows from another application of remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] . 
 we now relate the abstract setting of  [ sec : profinite ] to our present setting . 
 we have already seen that topological @xmath2- and @xmath0-unipotence are equivalent when @xmath141 ( see lemma [ lem : top - unip ] ) . 
 we prove below the analogous results for absolute @xmath2-semisimplicity and topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions ; but note that the formulations are slightly more complicated . 
 [ lem : abs - ss ] suppose that @xmath141 and @xmath18 . 
 if @xmath20 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 , then it is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n. if @xmath20 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n , then it is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 if and only if some finite power of it is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 . 
 suppose that @xmath20 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 . 
 certainly , some finite power of it is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 ( in fact , lies in @xmath8 ) . 
 further , its image in has finite , prime - to-@xmath0 order , say @xmath317 , hence is semisimple . 
 ( indeed , the unipotent part @xmath318 of also has finite , prime - to-@xmath0 order . 
 if @xmath237 ( respectively , @xmath245 ) , then any non - trivial unipotent element has infinite ( respectively , @xmath0-power ) order ; so @xmath319 . ) by lemma of @xcite , there is a complete subfield @xmath129 of @xmath2 such that            suppose that @xmath20 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n , and @xmath329 is such that @xmath330 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 . 
 write @xmath331 , with @xmath327 and @xmath332 such that @xmath333 is coprime to @xmath0 
 . then @xmath334 is also topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 , hence ( by lemma [ lem : top - unip ] ) topologically @xmath2-unipotent modulo n. on the other hand , by remark [ rem : power - of - f - ss - unip ] , @xmath334 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n. by proposition [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] , the image of @xmath334 in is trivial , so @xmath335 ; that is , @xmath20 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 . 
 [ cor : abs - ss - loc - cpct ] if @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field , then an element of @xmath7 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n if and only if it is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple modulo @xmath8 .    the ` if ' direction is clear . for the ` 
 only if ' direction , suppose that @xmath18 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n. by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] , @xmath20 is bounded modulo n ; so , by remark [ rem : equiv - bdd ] , it fixes some point @xmath336 . by lemma of @xcite , 
 there is a locally compact subfield @xmath129 of @xmath2 such that      then the image of @xmath20 in @xmath339 lies in @xmath340 . by remarks [ rem : equiv - bdd ] and [ rem : bdd = cpct ] , 
 @xmath340 is bounded , hence compact ; so its open subgroup @xmath341 has finite index . 
 that is , some ( finite ) power of @xmath20 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath8 . 
 now the result follows from lemma [ lem : abs - ss ] . 
 [ lem : top - jordan ] suppose @xmath141 and @xmath308 . if @xmath24 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 , then it is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n. if it is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n , then it is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 if and only if @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple . 
 it is clear from lemma [ lem : top - unip ] that , if @xmath24 is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n , then it is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 if and only if @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath0-semisimple . 
 suppose that @xmath24 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 . 
 put @xmath25 . by lemmata [ lem : top - unip ] and [ lem : abs - ss ] , @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo n and @xmath27 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent n. let @xmath64 be a finite extension such that @xmath212 ( hence @xmath281 ) belongs to @xmath69 . by lemmata [ lem : top - f - unip - jordan ] and 
 [ lem : top - unip ] , @xmath281 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent modulo @xmath342 . 
 since @xmath26 commutes with @xmath27 , it commutes also with @xmath281 , so @xmath343 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath342 . by proposition [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan_closure ] 
 , the image of @xmath26 in @xmath344 belongs to any maximal f - torus containing the image there of @xmath212 . 
 thus @xmath25 is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n.    [ cor : top - jordan - loc - cpct ] if @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field , then a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 , and conversely . 
 it is a minor inconvenience in our arguments that the stabiliser of a point in @xmath111 may be strictly larger than the associated parahoric subgroup . 
 the next result shows that , under some circumstances , we may bring an element of the stabiliser into the parahoric by passing to a tame extension .          upon replacing @xmath2 by the splitting field of a maximal @xmath2-tame torus , we may , and hence do , assume that is @xmath2-quasisplit . 
 let be a maximal @xmath2-split ( hence maximal @xmath2-tame ) torus in such that @xmath115 belongs to the apartment @xmath348 of , and the maximal @xmath2-torus in containing . 
 if @xmath323 is a root of in , then let @xmath290 be a root of in restricting to @xmath290 , and write @xmath349 for the fixed field in @xmath350 of @xmath351 ( the field denoted by @xmath352 in @xcite*4.1.8 and 4.1.14 ) . 
 up to @xmath2-isomorphism , this field does not depend on the choice of @xmath290 . by replacing @xmath2 by a further finite tame extension if necessary , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath2 contains the @xmath13th roots of unity in @xmath350 , and all the extensions @xmath353 are totally wildly ramified . 
 let @xmath354 be a totally ( tamely ) ramified extension of degree @xmath13 . 
 note that is still a maximal @xmath355-split torus . 
 fix a root @xmath323 of in . with the obvious notation , @xmath356 is the fixed field in @xmath350 of @xmath357  that is , @xmath358 . 
 since @xmath353 is totally wildly ramified and @xmath354 is tamely ramified , it follows that @xmath359 is a totally ramified extension of degree @xmath13 . 
 choose a chamber @xmath360 in @xmath348 containing @xmath115 in its closure , and a special vertex @xmath361 in the closure of @xmath360 . by regarding @xmath361 as an origin , we may , and hence do , identify @xmath348 with @xmath362 , hence the affine @xmath2-roots on @xmath348 ( in the sense of @xcite*2.5 , not @xcite*2.2 ) with certain functions on @xmath362 of the form @xmath363 with @xmath323 a root of in and @xmath364 . 
 ( here , @xmath365 is the usual pairing between @xmath366 and @xmath367 . ) specifically , @xmath368 must belong to the set denoted by @xmath369 in @xcite*6.2.2 . 
 by @xcite*4.2.21 ( adapted to our choice of origin , which is different from the one in  4.2.2 of _ loc . 
 _ ) , we have @xmath370 . 
 denote by @xmath371 the collection of zero - sets of affine @xmath2-roots . 
 we have that @xmath372 , viewed as a group of affine transformations of @xmath348 , is isomorphic to the semi - direct product @xmath373 , where @xmath374 is a lattice of translations , and @xmath375 is the finite group generated by the reflections through the hyperplanes in @xmath371 passing through @xmath361 . let @xmath376 be the ( normal ) subgroup of @xmath377 generated by reflections through the hyperplanes in @xmath371 
 . then @xmath378 is generated by translations by elements of the form @xmath379 , where @xmath323 is a root of in , @xmath380 is the associated coroot , and @xmath381 . 
 we will denote by a left subscript @xmath355 the analogues over @xmath355 of the objects defined over @xmath2 above . then the fact that @xmath382 and the obvious analogue for @xmath355 of our discussion above for @xmath2 show that @xmath383    let @xmath384 be the image of @xmath385 in the reduced building @xmath128 , and @xmath386 the optimisation of the function @xmath387 of @xcite*4.6.26 . 
 then , by proposition 4.6.28(i ) and dfinition 5.2.6 of _ loc . 
 _ , the group of integer points of the scheme @xmath388 of  4.6.2 of _ loc . 
 _  is the parahoric @xmath113 . by corollaire 4.6.12 of _ loc . 
 _ , there exists , for each root @xmath389 , an affine transformation @xmath390 such that the linear part of @xmath391 is reflection in the zero - set of @xmath323 ; and @xmath392 is generated by the elements @xmath391 . here , @xmath393 is the set of gradients of affine @xmath2-roots vanishing at @xmath115 , and @xmath392 is as in 4.6.3(6 ) of _ loc . 
 _ fix @xmath389 , and let @xmath394 be the affine @xmath2-root with gradient @xmath323 that vanishes at @xmath115 . since @xmath391 fixes @xmath115 , it must actually be reflection in the zero - set of @xmath394 . 
 that is , @xmath392 is generated by the reflections through hyperplanes in @xmath371 passing through @xmath115 . by proposition v.3.2 of @xcite 
 , it is actually the stabiliser of @xmath115 in @xmath376 . since @xmath395 , in the notation of 4.6.3(5 ) of _ loc . 
 _ , and since @xmath392 is the image in @xmath377 of @xmath396 , we have that @xmath397 of course , there is an analogous statement , which we will denote by ( @xmath398 ) , when @xmath2 is replaced by @xmath355 .    by proposition 4.6.28 of @xcite , 
 we may , and hence do , replace @xmath400 by an element of this intersection . then write @xmath401 for the image of @xmath400 in @xmath377 , and let @xmath402 be such that @xmath403 . 
 then @xmath404 . 
 since @xmath405 , we have by ( @xmath406 ) that @xmath407 . 
 thus , @xmath408 . by ( @xmath409 ) , we have that @xmath410 , so @xmath411    since @xmath401 stabilises @xmath115 , we have by ( @xmath398 ) and ( @xmath412 ) that it belongs to the image of @xmath413 in @xmath414 
 . that is , @xmath415 . in particular 
 , @xmath416 contains an element of @xmath417 , say @xmath418 
 . then @xmath419 . 
 by lemma of @xcite , we have that @xmath420 . 
 now we imitate the proof of lemma of _ _ loc . 
 cit.__to show that there is a finite tame extension @xmath421 such that @xmath422 . 
 denote by @xmath317 a totally ramified extension of @xmath423 of degree @xmath13 . 
 then , in the notation of @xcite*7.3 ( except that our @xmath317 and @xmath355 are kottwitz s @xmath355 and @xmath424 , respectively ; so @xmath425 is the inclusion of @xmath417 in @xmath426 ) , we have by ( 7.3.2 ) of _ loc . 
 _  that @xmath427 by lemma 2.3 of @xcite , @xmath428 and @xmath429 . 
 in particular , @xmath430 , so , since @xmath290 is an injection , @xmath431 . now let @xmath421 be any finite subextension of @xmath432 such that @xmath433 is unramified 
 . then @xmath434 . 
 the following two results show that the answers are `` yes '' to the analogues of the questions posed in @xcite*5.7 and 5.10 , where semisimplicity and unipotence are replaced by absolute @xmath2-semisimplicity and topological @xmath2-unipotence 
 . we must impose at first a somewhat artifical tameness hypothesis , but corollary [ cor : abs - f - ss - tame ] below will show that it can be omitted . 
 denote the right - hand set above by @xmath438 . by proposition of @xcite 
 , we have that @xmath439 is a compatibly filtered @xmath2-subgroup of , in the sense of definition of _ loc . 
 _ in particular , @xmath440 may be regarded canonically as a subset of @xmath441 for all discretely valued tame extensions @xmath64 , so that the statement makes sense . since @xmath442 for any discretely valued , tame , galois extension @xmath64 , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath2 is strictly henselian ( hence that is @xmath2-quasisplit ) and that @xmath20 belongs to a maximal @xmath2-split torus in . 
 since @xmath20 is bounded ( by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] ) and @xmath443 ( by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] ) , we have @xmath444 and @xmath445 . 
 we have that @xmath450 , and the images in @xmath451 of @xmath452 and @xmath453 are the groups of -points of a parabolic -subgroup @xmath454 and of its unipotent radical @xmath455 , respectively . 
 let t be the -split maximal torus in @xmath456 such that the image of @xmath457 in @xmath451 is @xmath458 . 
 by lemma of @xcite , we have that @xmath459 , so @xmath460 is semisimple . 
 thus it lies in a maximal -torus @xmath461 of @xmath454 . 
 we claim that there is an @xmath2-split torus @xmath462 in @xmath291 such that @xmath115 lies in the apartment of @xmath462 and the image of @xmath463 in @xmath451 is @xmath464 . 
 indeed , since is @xmath2-split , there is an isomorphism @xmath465 such that , for all @xmath466 , the image in @xmath467 of @xmath468 is @xmath469 . by proposition 3.5.4 of @xcite , 
 @xmath470 is generated by @xmath458 and the -points of those root subgroups corresponding to roots of t in @xmath456 that vanish at . 
 let @xmath471 be such a root . by corollaire 4.6.12(i ) of @xcite ( 
 applied to the function @xmath386 occurring in the proof of lemma [ lem : tame - para - ascent ] ) , @xmath472 is a root of in . 
 let @xmath473 be the affine root subgroup of @xmath7 that maps onto the -points of the root subgroup @xmath474 of @xmath456 . 
 since the image of @xmath475 in @xmath467 is @xmath476 , we have that @xmath477 . by proposition 3.5.4 of @xcite 
 , @xmath290 is a root of in @xmath291 , so @xmath478 . 
 that is , the image in @xmath451 of @xmath479 includes @xmath470 . 
 ( although we do not need to do so here , one can show that the image is precisely @xmath480 . ) since t and @xmath461 are maximal -tori in @xmath481 and is algebraically closed , there is an element @xmath482 such that @xmath483 . 
 let @xmath484 be an element whose image in @xmath451 is c. then @xmath485 certainly contains @xmath115 in its apartment , and has the property that the image of @xmath463 in @xmath451 is @xmath464 .    note 
 that we may , and hence do , also regard @xmath461 as a torus in @xmath486 . by proposition 5.1.10 of @xcite , there is an @xmath2-split torus @xmath487 in such that the apartment of @xmath487 contains @xmath226 and the image of @xmath488 in @xmath489 is @xmath464 . 
 since @xmath226 lies in a facet whose closure contains @xmath115 , the apartment of @xmath487 also contains @xmath115 . by proposition 4.6.28(iii ) of @xcite 
 , there is an element @xmath490 such that @xmath491 . 
 since @xmath488 and @xmath463 have the same image , namely @xmath464 , in @xmath451 , we have that @xmath492 . as in the proof of lemma [ 
 lem : tame - para - ascent ] , one sees from corollaire 4.6.12(ii ) of _ _ loc . 
 cit.__that k lies in the image in @xmath451 of @xmath493 . 
 thus , there are @xmath494 and @xmath495 such that @xmath496 
 . then @xmath497 . 
 we have shown that @xmath498 is open in @xmath438 . 
 since it is a union of apartments , it is also closed there . since @xmath438 is connected ( even convex ) , and since @xmath498 is non - empty , we have the desired equality . 
 we first show that the image of @xmath27 is unipotent . 
 if @xmath141 , then we have by lemma [ lem : top - unip ] that @xmath27 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent , hence that the image of @xmath27 in @xmath500 has @xmath0-power order . by @xcite*4.1(a ) , it is unipotent .    if @xmath275 , then let @xmath64 be a finite extension such that @xmath501 . since @xmath64 is tame , we have by lemma of @xcite that @xmath502 . 
 choose @xmath503 such that @xmath504 . 
 by lemma of _ loc . 
 _ , @xmath505 . by lemma of _ loc . 
 _ , there is a point @xmath506 such that @xmath507 and @xmath226 belongs to a facet of @xmath111 whose closure contains @xmath115 . 
 then the image of @xmath453 in @xmath113 is the group of -points of the unipotent radical of a parabolic -subgroup of @xmath456 . in particular , 
 the image of @xmath27 is unipotent . 
 now we show that the image of @xmath26 is semisimple . 
 let @xmath508 be a finite tame extension such that @xmath26 belongs to an @xmath424-split torus . 
 by lemma of @xcite , @xmath509 , so @xmath510 that is , @xmath116 is an -subgroup of @xmath511 . 
 thus we may , and hence do , assume , upon replacing @xmath2 by @xmath424 , that @xmath26 belongs to an @xmath2-split torus . by proposition [ prop : x - depth ] , we have that there is a maximal @xmath2-split torus whose apartment contains @xmath115 such that @xmath512 . 
 since @xmath26 is bounded ( by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] ) and @xmath443 ( by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] ) , we have @xmath513 
 . then the image of @xmath26 in @xmath500 belongs to the image of @xmath457 there , which is the group of -rational points of an -torus .      the ` 
 if ' direction is obvious , so we need only prove the ` only if ' direction . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] 
 , it suffices to prove this result over any finite extension of @xmath2 ; so we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath26 belongs to an @xmath2-split maximal torus in . 
 denote by @xmath438 the fixed points of @xmath20 , and similarly for @xmath26 and @xmath27 . 
 suppose that @xmath514 , and @xmath447 belongs to a facet whose closure contains @xmath115 . 
 denote by @xmath448 the reduction map @xmath449 . 
 the image of @xmath452 in @xmath451 is the group of -points of a parabolic -subgroup @xmath454 of @xmath456 . 
 since @xmath20 normalizes @xmath452 , normalizes @xmath515 ; so , by theorem 11.16 of @xcite , @xmath516 . 
 then also @xmath517 and @xmath518 . by lemma [ lem : top - jordan - to - jordan ] , 
 @xmath519 and @xmath520 . 
 since the preimage of @xmath515 in @xmath113 is @xmath452 , we have that @xmath26 and @xmath27 lie in @xmath452 . 
 in particular , @xmath521 . that is , @xmath522 is open in @xmath438 . since it is also closed , and since @xmath438 is connected ( even convex ) , we have equality , as desired . 
 now we are in a position to prove an existence result for topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions analogous to proposition [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] . 
 a more refined version of this result appears as theorem [ thm : top - f - jordan - projects ] below . 
 suppose that @xmath25 is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] , 
 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are bounded . by lemma [ lem : bounded - and - top - f - unip ] 
 , there is a point @xmath112 fixed by both , so @xmath203 . by remark [ rem : equiv - bdd ] , @xmath20 is bounded . 
 now suppose that @xmath20 is bounded . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] and 
 lemma [ lem : e - jordan - is - f - ratl ] , we may , and hence do , replace @xmath2 by discretely valued tame extensions as necessary . in particular , we will assume throughout that @xmath523 . 
 put @xmath258 .    if @xmath141 , then , as in remark [ rem : cent - of - ss ] , let @xmath246 be so large that @xmath524 and @xmath525 belong to @xmath54 . 
 let @xmath64 be a finite separable extension such that is @xmath65-split . 
 by proposition of @xcite , is a compatibly filtered @xmath65-subgroup of , in the sense of definition of _ loc . 
 _ in particular , the building of @xmath264 may be embedded isometrically and @xmath524-equivariantly into @xmath441 . 
 thus the orbits of @xmath524 in @xmath264 , hence in @xmath526 , are bounded ; that is , @xmath524 is bounded ( in @xmath54 ) . by remark [ rem : equiv - bdd ] 
 , there is a point @xmath527 fixed by @xmath524 . 
 denote by @xmath528 the reduction map @xmath529 . 
 let @xmath530 be so large that the order of @xmath531 modulo @xmath532 is indivisible by @xmath0 . 
 by lemma [ lem : tame - para - ascent ] , we may , and hence do , assume , upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite tame extension , that @xmath533 . by remark [ rem : equiv - unip ] and lemma [ lem : top - unip ] , @xmath534 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent . 
 let @xmath535 be so large that @xmath536 , and put @xmath537 . 
 since @xmath538 and is algebraically closed , we have that @xmath539 . 
 let t be a maximal -torus ( necessarily -split ) in @xmath540 , so that @xmath541 . by proposition 5.1.10 of @xcite 
 , there exists a maximal @xmath2-split torus in such that @xmath542 and the image of @xmath457 in @xmath543 is @xmath458 . 
 let @xmath202 be a preimage in @xmath457 of @xmath544 , so that @xmath545 . for @xmath466 , 
 let @xmath546 be the unique element of @xmath152 such that @xmath547 , and @xmath548 the unique element of @xmath152 such that @xmath549 . 
 finally , let @xmath26 be the unique element of @xmath550 such that @xmath551 for all @xmath466 . clearly , @xmath26 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple and @xmath2-tame ( even @xmath2-split , in the obvious language ) . 
 put @xmath552 . by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , 
 thus @xmath554 , so @xmath555 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent . by lemma [ lem : top - unip ] , @xmath555 is topologically @xmath38-unipotent ( where @xmath556 is a finite extension such that @xmath557 ) . 
 thus , @xmath558 is a topological @xmath38-jordan decomposition . by lemma [ lem : top - f - jordan - central ] , 
 @xmath26 and @xmath555 commute with @xmath559 ; in particular , with @xmath241 . put @xmath560 . since @xmath561 , we have that @xmath27 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent , hence , by another application of lemma [ lem : top - unip ] , topologically @xmath2-unipotent . 
 thus , @xmath25 is the desired topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition .    if @xmath275 , then @xmath243 . by remark [ rem : equiv - unip ] , we may , and hence do , assume , upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite ( necessarily tame ) extension , that @xmath562 and is @xmath2-split . by lemma [ lem : 
 bounded - and - top - f - unip ] , there is a point @xmath527 such that @xmath203 and @xmath563 . 
 let be an @xmath2-split maximal torus in whose apartment contains @xmath115 . 
 then @xmath564 fixes @xmath115 , hence is bounded . by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , the character values of @xmath212 lie in @xmath565 . for @xmath325 , 
 let @xmath548 be the unique element of @xmath152 such that @xmath566 . 
 in particular , @xmath567 for all roots @xmath290 of in . 
 let @xmath26 be the unique element of @xmath125 such that @xmath551 for all @xmath325 . 
 in particular , @xmath568 for all roots @xmath290 of in , so @xmath569 . clearly , @xmath26 is @xmath2-tame and absolutely @xmath2-semisimple , and belongs to an f - torus containing @xmath212 . 
 moreover , by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , @xmath570 . 
 thus @xmath571 . 
 by proposition of @xcite , is a compatibly filtered @xmath2-subgroup of , in the sense of definition of _ loc . 
 _ in particular , we may regard @xmath115 ( non - canonically ) as a point of @xmath111 . 
 then @xmath572 , so @xmath27 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent ( in @xmath7 ) . 
 clearly , @xmath573 commutes with @xmath569 . 
 thus , @xmath25 is the desired topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition .        by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] , @xmath20 is bounded . by proposition [ prop : 
 tjd = cpct ] , there is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath2-tame . by proposition [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] , @xmath574 .    the following rather technical result , which is now an immediate consequence of lemma [ lem : top - jordan - to - jordan ] , lemma [ lem : fixed - pts ] , and proposition [ prop : tjd = cpct ] , is really the heart of the paper . 
 it should be viewed as a quite precise existence result about topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions . 
 [ thm : top - f - jordan - projects ] if @xmath112 and @xmath575 , then there is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 project to the semisimple and unipotent parts , respectively , of the image of @xmath20 in @xmath500 .    if @xmath2 is an algebraic extension of a locally compact field , then the proof of theorem [ thm : top - f - jordan - projects ] can be considerably simplified . indeed , 
 in this case @xmath7 is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 , by remark [ rem : ilpf ] ; so , by propositions [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan_closure ] and [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] , an element @xmath575 has a topological @xmath0- , hence @xmath2- , jordan decomposition @xmath576 with @xmath499 . 
 now lemma [ lem : top - jordan - to - jordan ] shows that the images of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath500 are as desired . 
 suppose that @xmath577 is normal and consists entirely of topologically @xmath2-unipotent elements . 
 by lemma [ lem : top - jordan - to - jordan ] , the image of @xmath54 in @xmath451 consists entirely of unipotent elements . 
 denote by h its zariski closure in @xmath456 . 
 then @xmath578 is a connected , normal , unipotent subgroup of the reductive group @xmath456 , hence trivial . by lemma 22.1 of @xcite 
 , h is central in @xmath456 , hence consists entirely of semisimple elements . since we have already observed that it consists entirely of unipotent elements , h is trivial . 
 we already have an existence result ( proposition [ prop : tjd = cpct ] ) for topological @xmath2-jordan decompositions modulo the trivial group . 
 the next result handles such decompositions modulo any group n , for some fields @xmath2 .      1 . 
 [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_p ] @xmath20 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 . 
 [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_f ] @xmath20 has a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n. 3 .   [ 
 prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_bdd ] @xmath20 is bounded modulo n.    by corollary [ cor : abs - ss - loc - cpct ] and lemma [ lem : top - jordan ] , a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 is a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition modulo n , and conversely . 
 thus the equivalence ( [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_p ] ) @xmath579 ( [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_f ] ) is clear . 
 denote by @xmath448 the natural map @xmath580 . by remark [ rem : ilpf ] , is ind - locally - pro-@xmath0 , so we have by proposition [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] that has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition if and only if is compact ; that is , if and only if @xmath20 is compact modulo @xmath8 ( equivalently , by remark [ rem : bdd = cpct ] , bounded modulo n ) . 
 thus , to prove the equivalence ( [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_p ] ) @xmath579 ( [ prop : tjdz = cpct - mod - z_bdd ] ) , it suffices to prove that @xmath20 has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 if and only if has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition . 
 the ` only if ' direction is easy . for the ` 
 if ' direction , suppose that has a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition @xmath581 . 
 denote by @xmath54 the closure of the group generated by @xmath20 . by remark of @xcite , 
 the image in of @xmath54 is closed . by proposition [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan_closure ] 
 , @xmath582 belongs to this image . 
 let @xmath26 be a preimage of @xmath582 in @xmath54 . 
 then @xmath583 is a preimage of @xmath584 , and clearly @xmath26 and @xmath27 commute . 
 thus , @xmath25 is a topological @xmath0-jordan decomposition modulo @xmath8 . 
 it remains only to show that the images of @xmath212 and @xmath26 in @xmath276 belong to a common f - torus there . 
 we will show the equivalent statement that the images of @xmath26 and @xmath281 belong to a common f - torus . 
 clearly , it suffices to assume that n is the trivial subgroup , so we do so . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] 
 , the hypotheses remain valid if we replace @xmath2 by a finite extension , so we may , and hence do , make such replacements as necessary .    upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite extension , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath212 ( hence @xmath281 ) lies in @xmath7 and @xmath26 is @xmath2-split . by lemma [ lem : top - f - unip - jordan ] , @xmath281 is topologically @xmath2-unipotent . 
 thus , upon replacing @xmath2 by a finite extension , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath585 . by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] and lemma [ lem : 
 bounded - and - top - f - unip ] , there is an element @xmath112 such that @xmath586 and @xmath587 . by proposition of @xcite , 
 @xmath588 is a compatibly filtered @xmath2-subgroup of , in the sense of definition of _ loc . 
 _ thus , @xmath526 may be regarded ( non - canonically ) as a subset of @xmath111 in such a way that @xmath589 for @xmath590 . by proposition [ prop : 
 x - depth ] , we have that @xmath527 , so @xmath591 . in particular , @xmath281 belongs to some maximal @xmath2-torus in . 
 since @xmath26 is central in , it also belongs to . 
 we have already seen that an absolutely @xmath2-semisimple element is @xmath2-tame ( see corollary [ cor : abs - f - ss - tame ] ) . of course 
 , a topologically @xmath2-unipotent element need not be @xmath2-tame ( or even semisimple ) . in the next result 
 , we see that , for @xmath2-tame topologically @xmath2-unipotent elements , it is not necessary to introduce the finite extension @xmath64 of definition [ defn : top - f - ss - unip ] . 
 let @xmath20 be a bounded and @xmath2-tame element . by proposition [ prop : 
 tjd = cpct ] , it has a topological @xmath2-jordan decomposition @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath2-tame . by lemma of @xcite , 
 we may , and hence do , replace @xmath2 by a finite tame extension so that is @xmath2-quasisplit , and @xmath20 and @xmath26 belongs to @xmath2-split tori .          by lemma [ lem : top - f - jordan - central ] , 
 thus , commutes with @xmath26 , hence is a maximal @xmath2-split torus in @xmath593 . by lemma of @xcite , we have @xmath512 
 . therefore @xmath594 also . 
 since @xmath27 is bounded ( by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] ) and @xmath443 ( by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] ) , we have @xmath595 . by lemma [ lem : top - unip ] , @xmath27 is topologically @xmath0-unipotent , hence has @xmath0-power order modulo @xmath596 . on the other hand 
 , @xmath597 is the group of -rational points of an -split torus , hence contains no non - trivial elements of @xmath0-power order . 
 that is , @xmath598 . by lemma 2.4 of @xcite 
 , we have @xmath599 . by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] 
 , we have @xmath600 . by lemmata and of @xcite , @xmath601 in particular , @xmath502 , as desired . 
 we show that elements of which are absolutely @xmath2-semisimple or topologically @xmath2-unipotent can be lifted , upon passing to suitable finite extensions @xmath64 , to elements of @xmath69 which are absolutely @xmath65-semisimple or topologically @xmath65-unipotent , respectively . 
 [ prop : ts - lift ] if @xmath18 is absolutely @xmath2-semisimple modulo @xmath603 , then there is a finite separable extension @xmath64 such that @xmath604 contains an absolutely @xmath65-semisimple element .          by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - bdd ] , @xmath20 is bounded modulo @xmath603 , so @xmath607 is trivial on @xmath610 . 
 since @xmath611 is torsion - free and @xmath612 has finite index in @xmath613 , also @xmath607 is trivial on @xmath614 , hence induces a homomorphism @xmath67 from @xmath615 to @xmath611 . by choosing a uniformiser for @xmath65 , hence an isomorphism @xmath616 , we may , and hence do , 
 regard @xmath67 as an element of @xmath617 . 
 denote by @xmath618 the value of @xmath67 at the chosen uniformiser , so that @xmath619 for all @xmath325 
 . then @xmath620 is bounded .    by proposition [ prop : 
 tjd = cpct ] , there exists a topological @xmath65-jordan decomposition @xmath621 . 
 notice that @xmath622 and @xmath623 belong to a common f - torus ( namely , the image in of any f - torus in containing both @xmath624 and @xmath625 ) . 
 clearly , @xmath622 is absolutely @xmath65-semisimple . as in the proof of proposition 
 [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] , the character values of @xmath625 lie in @xmath272 for some finite extension @xmath218 . 
 the character values of @xmath623 , being a subset of those of @xmath625 , thus also belong to @xmath272 . by replacing @xmath38 by a further finite ( separable ) extension if necessary , we may , and hence do , assume that @xmath626 is @xmath38-split , so that remark [ rem : torus - filt ] gives @xmath627 . 
 by lemma of @xcite , we have that @xmath628 , so @xmath623 is topologically @xmath65-unipotent . 
 that is , @xmath629 is a topological @xmath65-jordan decomposition of . by proposition [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] , 
 @xmath630 , so @xmath631 . 
 thus @xmath604 contains an absolutely @xmath65-semisimple element , namely @xmath632 , as desired . 
 [ rem : tame - ts - lift ] the field @xmath64 occurring in proposition [ prop : ts - lift ] may be taken to be the splitting field for any @xmath2-torus containing @xmath20 . in particular , if @xmath20 is @xmath2-tame , then @xmath64 may be chosen to be tame . 
 ( notice that corollary [ cor : abs - f - ss - tame ] only guarantees that , not @xmath20 itself , is @xmath2-tame . ) 
 we do not know an equally satisfactory answer to when the field extension @xmath64 in the next proposition may be taken to be tame .      by remark [ rem : top - f - ss - unip - ascent ] , 
 we may , and hence do , replace @xmath2 by a finite extension so that is @xmath2-split and @xmath633 ; say @xmath112 is such that @xmath634 , and is an @xmath2-split maximal torus in whose apartment contains @xmath115 . 
 it suffices to show that the image of @xmath114 under the natural map @xmath635 includes @xmath636 . by remark of @xcite , since the affine root subgroups of are naturally isomorphic to those of , it suffices to show that the image of @xmath637 includes @xmath638 ( where @xmath639 ) . 
 the following square commutes : @xmath640 ( where the vertical maps are the obvious ones , the top horizontal map takes @xmath641 to the `` evaluation at @xmath418 '' homomorphism , and the bottom horizontal map is the analogous map for @xmath321 ) . by remark [ rem : torus - filt ] , the top and bottom horizontal arrows are isomorphisms . 
 the cokernel of the right - hand vertical map is @xmath642 , which is trivial since @xmath643 is a free -module . 
 thus the left - hand map is surjective , as desired .",0.33922629116929903,0.09271523178807901,0.5369576215744011,0.349824233044187,0.10045662100456601,0.551684737205505,0.06982156710628301,0.0,0.37372663617134005,2
44,", width=226 ]    be / x - ray binaries are systems in which a neutron star orbits a massive , early type star that at some stage has shown evidence of line emission in the balmer series . 
 the neutron star accretes via interactions with an extended envelope of material in the equatorial plane of the be star . 
 these systems typically have wide , eccentric orbits meaning most x - ray outbursts are associated with the neutron star s passage through periastron . 
 these type i outbursts are generally in the luminosity range @xmath1 and last a few days . 
 the less common type ii outbursts are brighter , @xmath2@xmath3 , and have no correlation with orbital phase . 
 they can last from a few days to several months , depending on the size and state of the circumstellar disk . 
 the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is known to house @xmath460 such be / x - ray binary systems @xcite , making up all but one of the known high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) population ( smc x-1 being the only known supergiant system ) . 
 @xcite present spectral classification of the counterparts to a large fraction of these systems and show that the spectral distribution is consistent with that of the galaxy , despite the lower metallicity environment . 
 the source that is the subject of this paper is the smc be / x - ray binary pulsar sxp6.85 = xte j0103 - 728 . 
 it was first detected in 2003 by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ as a 6.848 second pulsed x - ray source @xcite . 
 lomb - scargle periodograms of the x - ray data reveal a 112.5 day period @xcite , although it is uncertain as to whether this modulation is the orbital period of the system or if it is driven by the interval between x - ray outbursts . 
 the system was later detected in a 2006 _ xmm - newton _ observation at the position @xmath5 ( j2000.0 ) . 
 this detection led to the identification of a v=14.6 optical counterpart @xcite . 
 follow - up work by @xcite classified the counterpart as an o9.5v - b0v emission line star . 
 previous analysis of macho red and blue data by @xcite reveals a @xmath6d optical modulation in which the source brightens by @xmath40.5 magnitudes . 
 those authors also show that the source gets redder as it gets brighter . 
 @xcite analysed macho and ogle ii data of the source , finding an optical variation of @xmath4658 days . 
 this is similar to the value found by @xcite , providing evidence for a quasi - periodic growth and decay of a circumstellar disk . 
 @xcite also find a possible period of 24.82 days in the ogle ii data . 
 this period is closer to the expected orbital period of the system based on the corbet diagram @xcite than the x - ray modulation found in @xcite . in this paper 
 , we present long x - ray and optical lightcurves of sxp6.85 and analysis of x - ray timing and spectroscopic data taken by _ 
 rxte _ and _ integral_. near - ir photometric data taken during the most recent outburst are presented and compared to near - ir data taken during quiescence to show the connection between optical and x - ray activity in this system . 
 ground based h@xmath0 spectroscopic observations taken during the recent x - ray outburst are also presented and the equivalent width and assumed inclination are used as a simplistic measure of the size of the circumstellar disk . 
 during the past 11 years , the smc has been the subject of extensive monitoring @xcite using the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) ( see @xcite for instrument details and calibration model ) . during this time 
 , we have detected outbursts from sxp6.85 above the 99.99 percent significance level on four separate occasions . 
 the full _ rxte _ light curve is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : lightcurve ] . 
 the red points on the upper two panels show _ rxte _ detections above the 99 per cent significance level . 
 the pca collimator response during the most recent outburst was 0.33 , except for a period of @xmath410 days in november 2008 in which an intense set of observations were carried out pointing directly at the source . 
 these observations were in addition to weekly monitoring and were taken due to the unprecedented longevity of the outburst , which lasted for @xmath420 weeks . 
 the x - ray outbursts are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : lightcurve ] between mjd 52700 and mjd 54900 , with the detected spin period and detection significance plotted in fig . 
 [ fig : period ] . 
 data reduction was performed using heasoft v.6.6.2 analysis tools . 
 , width=226 ]    the timing and spectral analysis presented below is a result of _ rxte _ and _ integral _ data taken during the most recent epoch of pulsed x - ray emission . 
 _ rxte _ observations were made approximately weekly between 2008 august 10 and 2008 december 30 . according to the ephemeris in @xcite 
 , the maximum in x - ray luminosity of the system is expected to occur on 2008 november 23 ( mjd 54793 ) . 
 although this date coincides with the detection , it is clear that the length and brightness indicate a type ii outburst and not a smaller type i outburst usually associated with passage through periastron . 
 figure [ fig : test ] shows _ rxte _ pulse profiles in the 3 - 10kev energy band for 10 observations throughout the outburst . 
 the light curves were folded at the pulse period and arbitrarily phase shifted to align the point of minimum amplitude .      the ibis telescope aboard _ integral _ , 
 which is optimised for an energy range of 15 - 200kev and has a field of view of 30@xmath7 30@xmath8 , is uniquely suited to observing large sky areas for point sources . 
 as part of a key programme monitoring campaign on the smc and 47 tuc , _ integral _ observed the smc and magellanic bridge for approximately 80ks per satellite revolution from 2008 november 11 to 2008 december 21 . 
 individual pointings ( science windows ) were processed using the _ integral _ offline science analysis v.7.0 ( osa ) @xcite and were mosaiced into revolution sky maps using the weighted mean of the flux in the 15 - 35kev energy range . 
 figure [ fig : integral ] shows the ibis detections of sxp6.85 plotted over a section of the _ rxte _ pulsed flux light curve from fig . 
 [ fig : lightcurve ] . 
 these data represent the hard x - ray flux measured from sxp6.85 . the brightest detection at 0.63 cts / s corresponds to a peak luminosity of 1.1@xmath910@xmath10erg / s . 
 the significance of the detection of the source once all science windows from the 33d of coverage had been taken into account was 6.4 sigma . 
 we used the four brightest detections to make an x - ray spectrum to compare with the softer _ rxte _ spectrum . 
 the _ rxte _ 
 spectrum was taken on mjd 54772 , approximately 4 weeks before the _ integral _ data . 
 although this is not ideal for comparison , we are limited to the brightest detections with both satellites and to detections with _ 
 rxte _ in which no other source was active . 
 , width=317 ]    , width=226 ]    the _ rxte _ and _ integral _ spectra were fitted with an absorbed cutoff powerlaw model using xspec version 11.3.2 @xcite . 
 the absorption was frozen at @xmath11@xmath12 @xcite . 
 the power law had a photon index of 0.8@xmath130.2 with a cutoff at 14.6@xmath139.6kev . 
 the two spectra were fit with this model simultaneously with an offset allowed to vary during the fit . 
 a _ @xmath14 _ of 0.75 ( 33 d.o.f ) indicates a good fit to the data ( see fig . 
 [ fig : xspec ] ) . 
 this analysis reveals a peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath47@xmath15 ergs@xmath16 in the 3 - 10 kev band , assuming a distance to the smc of 60kpc . only _ rxte _ spectra 
 in which there was no other detected pulsed x - ray emission were used to calculate @xmath17 . 
 we find that this value varies by a factor of two during the outburst . 
 analysis of _ xmm _ data by @xcite show the source at a higher luminosity , @xmath17=@xmath18 ergs@xmath16 in the 0.2 - 10 kev band , and showing variations of a factor of two in intensity on time scales of ten minutes . 
 the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project has been steadily monitoring millions of stars in the magellanic clouds for the past 12 years . 
 the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , takes photometric images in the i band , which now make up a decade long database that includes most of the hmxb systems in the smc ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details on the instrument and catalogue ) . the bottom panel in fig . 
 [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the ogle ii , ogle iii and macho _ blue _ light curves of sxp6.85 ( blue , black and red points respectively ) . 
 the macho data have been arbitrarily normalised for viewing purposes . 
 it is clear that the long period oscillations described in @xcite are also present in the ogle data , indicating a quasi - periodic brightening that is intrinsic to the be star ; most likely the growth and decay of the circumstellar disk . 
 although the ogle iii light curve does not extend up to the most recent _ rxte _ detection ( this particular source falls on an ogle chip - gap , thereby needing a different reduction process to the normal pipeline ) , it is apparent that the most luminous x - ray outbursts seem to coincide with the epochs of maximum optical brightness . 
 this again suggests that the x - ray detections are type ii outbursts , being independent of binary phase . 
 however , it is also apparent that there are 2 detections which fall at times of optical minima ( fig . [ 
 fig : lightcurve ] & fig . 
 [ fig : period ] ) . 
 thus , we can not rule out there also being accretion onto the neutron star during times of a reduced circumstellar disk . 
 we also note that the _ xmm _ detection is consistent with an optical maximum .    [ cols=""<,<,>,>,>,>"",options=""header "" , ]      +     spectrum of sxp6.85 taken with the eso 3.6-m telescope on 2007 september 17 . 
 bottom panel : h@xmath0 spectrum of sxp6.85 taken with the saao 1.9-m telescope on 2008 december 16.[fig : spec],width=226 ] 
 the optical light curve of sxp6.85 displays long - term , quasi - periodic variations which are most likely associated with the growth and decay of the be star s circumstellar disk . 
 changes in the ( b - r ) colour support this idea . by comparison with the x - ray light curve 
 we find that at least two of the x - ray outbursts are consistent with optical maximum . 
 this has also been observed in other such systems ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) . 
 the x - ray light curve shows no periodic behaviour that can be attributed to a binary period . 
 all the detected outbursts seem to be driven by the intrinsic behavior of the be star . 
 we note that only small fluctuations in the pulse period are observed and that these show no correlation with time . of greater interest 
 is the pulse period history of the most recent type ii outburst ( mjd 54688 - mjd 54830 ) , which shows no general spin - up trend . 
 this is an unusual observation as most hmxb systems show spin up of the neutron star during type ii outbursts due to the high accretion torques present .    although we were unable to gain any quantitative handle of how the pulsed emission changed during the outburst , 
 the pulse profiles show very complex double and triple peaked structure ( see fig . [ 
 fig : test ] ) . 
 this tells us much about the geometry of the system and of the beam emission regions : we see both poles from the pulsar , with the emission from the poles asymmetrical and , except for the profiles corresponding to mjd = 54725 and 54744 in fig . 
 [ fig : test ] , always favouring one pole . 
 this implies accretion onto the poles is asymmetric . 
 the variability in the shape and width of the most prominent peak suggests we are seeing both fan and pencil beam emission . 
 however , it has been observed that pulse profiles are very messy at low energies , with the possibility that the absorption is varying with neutron star spin phase , so it is difficult to confirm that we are indeed seeing both fan and pencil beams in these energy ranges . 
 @xcite theorise that pencil beams should be dominant under low accretion rates ( hence low luminosities ) and that fan beams should dominate at high accretion rates , as the radiation is strongly absorbed by the infalling material and can largely only be emitted sideways . however , from the profiles presented here there seems to be no clear dependence of the profile shape on flux . 
 the pulsed fraction calculated from the folded light curves is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : pulse_frac ] . the formula used in these calculations 
 is given in eqn . 
 [ equ : pf ] . 
 we show that there is considerable variation in the measured pulsed fraction throughout the outburst , with the source appearing to increase and then return to some base level . 
 @xmath19    we note that the pulsed fraction is only correct if sxp6.85 was the only source detected in that observation . if other sources were detected , then the base emission includes emission from those objects and as such the pulsed fraction is only the lower limit of the actual value . 
 we find a marginal correlation between source intensity and pulsed fraction , which could be attributed to the fractional change in the contribution of quiescent sources in the field . 
 transient sources have been previously detected at low luminosities while in quiescence ( i.e. without any pulsed emission ) . 
 therefore , although we can be sure there was no bright pulsed emission from any source in the field of view , we can not be certain that there was no continuous emission . 
 the values presented in fig . 
 [ fig : pulse_frac ] are a factor of three lower than the value presented in @xcite , having taken the method of calculating the pulsed fraction into account . 
 this implies either a significant contribution from background sources to the _ rxte _ spectrum or that there has been a dramatic change of pulsed emission between the two observations . 
 those authors also find that sxp6.85 has one of the hardest spectra of known hmxb systems with a photon index of @xmath40.4 . 
 this also suggests that there is contamination from other sources in the _ rxte _ spectrum , softening the powerlaw photon index to the value of 0.8 found in this study . 
 it has been observed in other be / x - ray binary systems that the ( j - k ) colour often remains constant for long periods of time despite dramatic changes in near - ir magnitude ( e.g. @xcite ) . 
 sxp6.85 also exhibits this behavior as can be seen in table [ ta : irsf ] . 
 the brightness of the system has increased by almost one third of a magnitude in the year between the two irsf observations . 
 however , the ( j - k ) colour has remained unchanged at 0.17 . 
 this is indicative of the temperature of the circumstellar disk remaining constant , whilst the increased brightness indicates the surface area of the disk has increased . 
 it is possible to make a rough guess at the size of the circumstellar disk using the h@xmath0 w@xmath20 measurements and making some assumptions on inclination and optical depth . using the models of @xcite 
 , we estimate the disk half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) radius to be approximately 3r@xmath21 on 2008 december 16 and approximately 2.7r@xmath21 on 2007 september 17 , an increase of over 11 percent in the year leading up to the recent type ii outburst . in this calculation 
 we do not take into account any truncation caused by the neutron star and we make some approximations regarding the binary system : the effective temperature of the star is 30000k , the inclination is 10@xmath8 , the optically thin outer boundary of the disk is at 50r@xmath21 and the disk continuum dilution factor is 0.0033 @xcite . 
 see @xcite and @xcite for more detail on the model input parameters . 
 the key thing to note is that varying the disk outer boundary by factors of 2 - 3 changes the calculated hwhm radius by approximately 10 percent as the model assumes a small contribution to the h@xmath0 flux from the optically thin part of the disk . 
 thus , the relative growth of the disk is set by the model despite the uncertainty in the actual radius . 
 we also note that the 2008 measurement was made after sxp6.85 had been in outburst for more than 16 weeks , and as such the disk may have been significantly larger at the start of the outburst than the value estimated here . 
 if we consider the ir magnitudes taken in december 2007 and december 2008 , this yields a fractional increase in brightness of 1.33 ; a factor of three higher than the prediction made using the equivalent widths . 
 the ogle light curve shows variations on the order of 0.7 magnitudes over the entire epoch of coverage , corresponding to a factor of 1.9 in brightness ( here we assume that the change in flux is proportional to the change in surface area of the disk , which is reasonable for an optically thick disk ) . 
 if we assume that the recent x - ray activity occured during an optical maximum and that the disk hwhm at this time was @xmath43r@xmath21 , this implies the minimum , or quiescent , level of the disk is at @xmath41.5r@xmath21 . 
 clearly these are rough estimates based on some simplistic approximations . 
 more detailed modelling is encouraged to reveal a more accurate description of the circumstellar disk in this system . 
 w@xmath20 measurements of sxp6.85 taken at the saao 1.9-m telescope during december 2008 . 
 the large error bars associated with the first three values are due to a lower snr from shorter observations . 
 the horizontal dashed line represents the h@xmath0 w@xmath20 of the source during the september 2007 observation . 
 the associated error in this case is much lower due to the higher snr that can be obtained at the eso 3.6-m telescope.[fig : eqw],width=226 ]    , width=226 ] 
 the x - ray and optical data presented here are evidence that sxp6.85 is indeed a be / x - ray binary system . 
 the x - ray light curve shows the transient nature of the source , whilst the optical and near - ir data suggest there are quasi - periodic modulations that are intrinsic to the be star that are likely to be associated with the extended envelope of matter in the equatorial plane of the companion . 
 flux measurements show that an extended disk is indeed present in this system , with the shape of the emission line suggesting low inclination to the observer . 
 the small variation in the spin period is also evidence of a low inclination system , assuming the circumstellar disk and the neutron star orbit lie in the same plane . 
 w@xmath20 measurements of the h@xmath0 line reveal a growth in the emission of h@xmath0 photons from the system which is most likely a result of an increase in the size of the circumstellar disk ; an argument that is supported by the increase in optical luminosity that culminated in the most recent epoch of pulsed x - ray emission from the neutron star . 
 folded x - ray light curves reveal the geometry of the emission region on the surface of the neutron star and show the highly variable nature of the accretion region . finally , 
 a simple estimate of the radius of the circumstellar disk was made , quantifying the size of the disk during periods of x - ray activity and during quiescence .

45,"the precise measurement of final state hadrons in lepton nucleon deep inelastic scattering constitutes an excellent benchmark for different features of perturbative quantum chromodynamics . among them , the calculation of higher order corrections , which have been explored and validated for most processes up to next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy . for the one particle inclusive processes 
 only very recently there has been progress beyond the leading order ( lo ) @xcite . 
 and up to now there were no analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections for the electroproduction of hadrons with non vanishing transverse momentum . 
 the analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections allows us to check factorization in a direct way , which means that collinear singularities showing up in the partonic cross section factorize into parton densities ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) . as a consequence of this explicit cancellation , 
 the resulting cross section is finite and can be straightforwardly convoluted with pdfs and ffs in a fast and stable numerical codes . 
 the analytical result is still sufficiently exclusive and keeps the dependence on the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the produced hadron , allowing a detailed comparison with the experimental data . in the following 
 we summarize the results obtained in ref . 
 we consider the process @xmath3 where a lepton of momentum @xmath4 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath5 with a lepton of momentum @xmath6 and a hadron @xmath7 of momentum @xmath8 tagged in the final state . omitting target fragmentation at zero transverse momentum , which has been discussed at length in @xcite , 
 the cross section for this process can be written as @xmath9\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the partonic level cross section corresponding to the process and is calculated order by order in perturbation theory through the related parton - photon squared matrix elements @xmath11 for the @xmath12 processes @xmath13 in terms of the standard kinematical variables @xcite .    at order-@xmath0 , 
 the partonic cross sections receive contributions from the following reactions : @xmath14 where any of the outgoing partons can fragment into the final state hadron @xmath7 .    at variance with the @xmath15 case , where the integration over final states leads to overlapping singularities along various curves in the residual phase space , here 
 the only remaining singularities are found at @xmath16 and thus they can be dealt with the standard method . after combining real and virtual contributions to a given partonic process , the cross section can be written as @xmath17 where the coefficient of the single poles , @xmath18 , as well as the finite contributions @xmath19 , include ` delta ' and ` plus ' distributions in @xmath20 . 
 the ir double poles present in the individual real and virtual contributions cancel out in the sum , providing the first straightforward check on the angular integration of real amplitudes and the loop integrals in the virtual case . in the real terms 
 , the above mentioned double poles come from the product of a pole arising in the integration over the spectators phase space and a single pole coming from the expansion of @xmath21 factors . 
 double poles in the virtual contributions always arise from loop integrals . 
 the remaining singularities , contributing to the single pole , are of uv and collinear origin . 
 the former are removed by means of coupling constant renormalization , whereas the latter have to be factorized in the redefinition of parton densities and fragmentation functions . 
 in figure [ fig : x_bj ] we show the lo and nlo predictions for the electroproduction of neutral pions as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , in the kinematical range of the h1 experiment @xcite , together with the most recent data for the range @xmath24 . 
 the cross sections are computed as described in the previous sections , applying h1 cuts and using mrst02 parton densities @xcite . 
 similar results are found using other sets of modern pdfs . for the input fragmentation functions , we use two different sets , the ones from reference @xcite denoted as kkp and those from @xcite referenced as k. we set the renormalization and factorization scales as the average between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and we compute @xmath27 at nlo(lo ) fixing @xmath28 as in the mrst analysis . 
 the plots clearly show that the nlo cross sections are much larger than the lo ones , even by the required order of magnitude in certain kinematical regions . 
 another interesting feature is that the uncertainty due to the choice of a fragmentation functions set is also quite noticeable , this fact driven by the different gluon content of the two sets considered here . 
 low @xmath25 bins seem to prefer kkp set , which have a larger gluon - fragmentation content , whereas for larger @xmath25 both sets agree with the data within errors . 
 lo estimates show a much smaller sensitivity on the choice of fragmentation functions , since gluon fragmentation does not contribute significantly to the cross section at this order . 
 the rather large size of the k - factor can , then , be understood as a consequence of the opening of a new dominant ( ` leading - order ' ) channel , and not to the ` genuine ' increase in the partonic cross section that might otherwise threaten perturbative stability . 
 the dominance of the new channel is due to the size of the gluon distribution at small @xmath22 and to the fact that the h1 selection cuts highlight the kinematical region dominated by the @xmath29 partonic process .      in figure 
 [ fig : discri ] we show the different contributions to the cross section discriminated by the underlying partonic process . 
 notice that at very small @xmath22 the @xmath30 term can be by itself several times larger than the lo contribution , remaining larger or comparable even for higher @xmath22 values . 
 the forward selection is also responsible of the scale sensitivity of the cross section , as it supresses large components with small scale dependence whereas it stresses components as @xmath30 whose scale dependence would be partly canceled only at nnlo        a. daleo , c. garca canal , r. sassot , _ nucl .

46,"energy dissipation has profound consequences in granular materials , especially in dilute gases , where the dynamics are controlled by collisions @xcite . 
 dissipation is responsible for many interesting collective phenomena including clustering @xcite , formation of shocks @xcite , and hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite . 
 another consequence is the anomalous statistical physics that includes the non - maxwellian velocity distributions @xcite and the breakdown of energy equipartition in mixtures @xcite .    for an elastic gas in equilibrium , 
 the temperature , defined as the average kinetic energy , characterizes the entire distribution function including all of the moments , the bulk of the distribution , as well as the tail of the distribution . outside of equilibrium , 
 the temperature is not sufficient to characterize the energy distribution . 
 granular gases are inherently out of equilibrium and a complete characterization must therefore include the behavior of typical particles , the behavior of energetic particles , as well as the moments of the distribution . 
 for example , the energy distribution may have power - law tails with divergent high - order moments @xcite and consequently , the moments exhibit multiscaling @xcite . 
 generally , nonequilibrium effects are pronounced in the absence of energy input to balance the dissipation but can be suppressed by injection of energy where the deviation from a maxwellian distribution affects only extremely energetic particles @xcite .    while there is substantial understanding of the energy distribution of frictionless granular gases , much less 
 is known theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite when the rotational degrees of freedom are taken into account . 
 it is difficult to measure the rotational motion experimentally , and the few available measurements are restricted to two - dimensions . 
 surface roughness and friction have important consequences and the hydrodynamic theory @xcite must be modified , if the particles have spin @xcite . 
 equipartition does not hold for the average rotational and translational temperature  neither in the free cooling case @xcite nor for a driven system @xcite . in general , 
 rotational and linear degrees of freedom are correlated in direction @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we investigate the nature of the full energy distribution , that is , the bivariate distribution of rotational and translational energy . motivated by the fact that on average the total energy is not partitioned equally between rotational and translational degrees of freedom , 
 we focus on the bivariate distribution @xmath5 of total energy @xmath0 and the modified ratio @xmath1 of rotational to total energy . 
 we thereby generalize the understanding of frictionless granular matter in terms of the energy distribution to rough grains . 
 our starting point is the nonlinear boltzmann equation with a collision rule that accounts for the coupling of translational and rotational motion due to tangential restitution . 
 we study stationary solutions of the inelastic boltzmann equation that describe steady states achieved through a balance between energy injections that are powerful but rare and energy dissipation through inelastic collisions . for high - energy particles 
 we derive a linear equation for the bivariate energy distribution . 
 the latter can be shown to factorize  @xmath6  into a product of the distribution of the total energy , @xmath7 , and the distribution of the fraction of energy stored in the rotational degrees of freedom , @xmath3 . 
 the former distribution decays algebraically with energy : @xmath8 . 
 the fraction of energy stored in rotational motion is universal for energetic particles in the sense that @xmath3 approaches a limiting distribution independent of energy . 
 furthermore , this quantity has a number of interesting features . 
 first , the distribution is not uniform , as it would be , if equipartition were to hold . 
 second , the distribution is not analytic but has singularities at special energy ratios . 
 third , the distribution and in particular its singularities depend sensitively on the moment of inertia and the collision parameters . only for energetic particles is this distribution well defined . in general 
 , the partition of energy into rotational and translational motion depends on the magnitude of the energy . 
 this paper specifically addresses two - dimensions , although the theoretical approach and the reported qualitative behavior are generic . 
 we also develop a general framework for describing high - energy collisions and we use this framework to study freely cooling maxwell molecules where the moments of the energy distribution can be found in a closed form . 
 for example , the two granular temperatures corresponding to the rotational and translational motions are coupled and generally , they are not equal . the high - energy behavior found for driven steady - states extends to freely cooling gases . 
 the rest of this paper is organized as follows . 
 we review the collision rules and introduce the nonlinear kinetic theory in section ii . 
 we then derive the linear kinetic theory for high - energy particles in section iii . 
 next , in section iv , we study driven steady states and solve for the stationary energy distribution . freely cooling maxwell molecules 
 are discussed in section v and we conclude in section vi . 
 the appendices detail technical derivations . 
 our system consists of an infinite number of identical particles with mass @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 , and moment of inertia @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a dimensionless quantity . 
 each particle has a linear velocity @xmath13 and an angular velocity @xmath14 . 
 its total energy is shared by the linear and the rotational motion , @xmath15 , or explicitly , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in a collision between two particles , their velocities 
 @xmath19 with the labels @xmath20 , change according to @xmath21 where the postcollision velocities are denoted by primes . in a binary collision , 
 rotational and translational energy are exchanged , while the total energy decreases . in this study , we consider tangential restitution in addition to the standard normal restitution . 
 let @xmath22 be the position of particle @xmath23 , then the directed unit vector connecting the centers of the colliding particles is . 
 we term this vector the impact direction . 
 the collision rules are most transparent in terms of @xmath24 the particle velocity at the contact point    [ relative ] @xmath25    the inelastic collision laws state that the normal component of the relative velocity @xmath26 is reversed and reduced by the normal restitution coefficient @xmath27 . 
 the tangential component is either reversed ( rough particles ) or not ( smooth particles ) and in any case reduced by the tangential restitution coefficient @xmath28 , according to the following collision rules :    [ law ] @xmath29    inelastic collisions conserve linear and angular momentum . 
 conservation of linear momentum implies that the total linear velocity does not change , and conservation of angular momentum enforces that the angular momentum of each particle with respect to the point of contact remains the same , because there is no torque acting at the point of contact . 
 the collision laws combined with these conservation laws specify the postcollision velocities as linear combinations of the precollision velocities @xcite    [ rule ] @xmath30    where the shorthand notations and were introduced . 
 these collision rules involve the normal and tangential collision parameters , defined as @xmath31 their range of values is bounded by and . 
 details of the derivation of the collision rules are given in appendix a , as they are relevant for our discussion . 
 the energy dissipation , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 the energy dissipation is always positive , except when the collisions are elastic , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( perfectly smooth spheres ) or @xmath36 ( perfectly rough spheres ) . 
 the collision rate @xmath37 is the rate by which the two particles approach each other . for hard spheres , 
 this rate is simply the normal component of the relative velocity , but we study the general case @xmath38 with @xmath39 . of course , the collision rate vanishes , @xmath40 , when the particles are moving away from each other , @xmath41 . 
 when particles interact via the central potential @xmath42 then @xmath43 @xcite . 
 the two limiting cases are hard spheres ( @xmath44 ) and maxwell molecules ( @xmath45 ) where the collision rate is independent of the velocity @xcite . 
 the central quantity in kinetic theory is the probability @xmath46 that a particle has the velocities @xmath47 at time @xmath48 . 
 we study spatially homogeneous situations where this velocity distribution function is independent of position . under the strong assumption that the velocities of the two colliding particles are completely uncorrelated 
 , the velocity distribution obeys the boltzmann equation @xmath49.\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] we integrate over all impact directions with @xmath50 @xcite and over the precollision velocities weighted by the respective probability distributions . 
 there are two gain terms and two loss terms , because the velocities of interest @xmath51 can be identified with any one of the four velocities in the collision rule and the kernel is simply the collision rate . 
 the focus of this study is the energy distribution that generally depends only on two variables : @xmath52 and @xmath2 . 
 it is our aim to compute the distribution @xmath53 for asymptotically large energies . 
 this will be done for a system which is driven at very high energies as well as for an undriven system .    as a first step to this goal 
 , we simplify the boltzmann equation in the limit of large energies . 
 extremely energetic particles are rare and as a result it is unlikely that such particles will encounter each other . 
 hence , energetic particles typically collide with much slower particles . 
 since the collision rules are linear , the velocity of the slower particle barely affects the outcome of the collision . 
 we can therefore neglect the slower velocity . 
 substituting and or and into ( [ rule ] ) gives the cascade process @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the precollision velocity of the energetic particle and @xmath56 with @xmath57 are the consequent postcollision velocities . with these definitions , 
 the collision rules for extremely energetic particles are    [ rule - v ] @xmath58    where we have set @xmath59 , so that the moment of inertia , @xmath60 , is dimensionless . 
 a collision between a high - energy particle and a typical - energy particle produces two energetic particles with an energy total that is smaller than the initial energy . 
 this cascade process transfers energy from large scales to small scales . 
 since the cascade process involves only one particle , the tail of the probability distribution @xmath61 obeys the _ linear _ equation @xmath62.\end{aligned}\ ] ] there are two gain terms and one loss term according to the cascade process . 
 formally , this linear rate equation can be obtained from the full nonlinear equation by treating either one of the precollision velocities as negligible and then integrating over this small velocity . 
 this procedure leads to four gain terms and two loss terms and thus , the factor @xmath63 in drops out . 
 we stress that the linear equation is valid only in the high - energy limit . 
 we also comment that the linear equation for the high - energy tail of the velocity distribution may be valid in cases where the full nonlinear equation is not . 
 whereas the nonlinear equation requires that all possible velocities are uncorrelated , the linear equation merely requires that energetic particles are uncorrelated with typical particles . 
 this is a much weaker condition .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to two space dimensions , i.e. rotating disks . in that case 
 the rotational velocities are always perpendicular to the linear velocities . 
 thus , we conveniently denote the unit vector in the tangential direction by @xmath64 and the unit vector coming out of the plane by @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 . 
 the precollision velocities of the energetic particle @xmath68 and @xmath69 are compactly written as @xmath70 $ ] . with this notation , 
 the postcollision velocities specified in are @xmath71 , \qquad{\rm and}\qquad \big[\eta_n v_n,\eta_t ( v_t - w),(\eta_t / q)(v_t - w)\big],\ ] ] respectively . 
 we now treat the three velocity components , namely the normal component of the velocity @xmath72 , the tangential component of the velocity @xmath73 , and the scaled angular velocity @xmath74 as a three dimensional vector with magnitude @xmath75 , polar angle @xmath76 , and azimuthal angle @xmath77 : @xmath78 the magnitude @xmath75 gives the energy @xmath79 while the polar angle characterizes the fraction of energy stored in the rotational degree of freedom , @xmath80 . in this representation , 
 the postcollision velocities are three - dimensional vectors with magnitude @xmath81 , polar angle @xmath82 , and azimuthal angle @xmath83 . 
 the collision rules allow us to express these quantities in terms of @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath57 . 
 the magnitudes of the postcollision velocities are proportional to the magnitude of the precollision velocity . 
 the three velocity components are scaled by three dimensionless constants @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that depend on the angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the energetic particle , the collision parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the moment of inertia @xmath91 ,    [ abc ] @xmath92    the new energies are proportional to the precollision energies @xmath93 we term the parameters @xmath94 the contraction parameters . since the collisions are dissipative , these parameters satisfy the inequality @xmath95 . the equality @xmath96 holds only for elastic collisions ( @xmath97 ) . 
 the energy dissipation is @xmath98 with @xmath99 or explicitly , @xmath100 the polar and azimuthal angles are given by @xmath101 respectively . 
 let us represent solid angles by @xmath102 . with this definition , 
 the cascade process is @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 given by and . 
 energetic particles have an important property : the solid angle is not coupled to the energy ! 
 indeed , the postcollision angles depend only on the precollision angle . 
 the cascade process has the following geometric interpretation : a three dimensional vector is duplicated into two vectors . 
 subsequently , these two vectors are scaled down by the contraction parameters , and rotated according to the angular transformation . 
 we can now write the linear boltzmann equation for @xmath106 , the distribution of energy and solid angle , in a _ closed _ form @xmath107.\end{aligned}\ ] ] time was rescaled , @xmath108 , to absorb the constant which arises from replacing velocity by energy in the collision rate . 
 henceforth , we implicitly assume that the distribution @xmath106 is independent of @xmath109 because the distribution of _ linear _ velocities must be isotropic . 
 the integration over the energy is performed using the collision rule , leading to the linear rate equation for the tail of the energy distribution @xmath110.\]]this is a non - local equation as the density of particles with energy @xmath0 is coupled to the density of particles with the higher energies @xmath111 and @xmath112 . 
 we stress that this equation is a straightforward consequence of the cascade process and that it can also be derived from the full nonlinear boltzmann equation . yet , there may be situations where the linear equation is valid , while the nonlinear equation is not valid . 
 the bivariate energy distributions @xmath106 and @xmath53 are completely equivalent but we analyze the former because the cascade process is transparent in terms of the total energy and the solid angle . 
 the inelastic boltzmann equation admits stationary solutions for _ frictionless _ particles . 
 these stationary solutions describe driven steady - states with rare but powerful injection of energy . 
 the injected energy cascades from high - energies down to small energies , thereby balancing the energy lost in collisions . at energies below the injection scale , 
 eqs .  , and 
 are not altered by the energy source and consequently , the stationary solution of the inelastic boltzmann equation holds up to this large energy scale @xcite . here , we seek a corresponding stationary solution for particles with _ rotational _ degrees of freedom in the high energy limit . 
 the stationary solution has to fulfill eq .   with the left hand side set to zero @xmath113.\ ] ] at high - energies , 
 the solid angle is not coupled to the energy , as follows from eq .  . 
 this fact has a major consequence : the bivariate energy distribution @xmath106 takes the form of a product of the energy distribution and the distribution of solid angle , @xmath114 , @xmath115 as @xmath116 . 
 the angle distribution is normalized , @xmath117 . 
 it does not depend on the azimuthal angle , because on average the two components of the linear velocity are equivalent . 
 due to the equi - dimensional ( in @xmath0 ) structure of the steady - state equation , the product ansatz is a solution when the distribution @xmath7 decays algebraically @xmath118 as @xmath116 @xcite . 
 we obtain a closed equation for the distribution @xmath114 by substituting the product ansatz with the power - law form into the steady - state equation @xmath119.\ ] ] this equation is linear in @xmath114 . 
 however , it is nonlinear in @xmath120 and moreover , the solid angles @xmath121 in and the contraction parameters @xmath122 in are complicated functions of the solid angle @xmath123 .    equation ( [ g - eq ] ) involves two unknowns quantities , the exponent @xmath120 and the distribution function @xmath114 . 
 a solution does not exist for arbitrary values of @xmath120 . 
 in fact , there is one and only one value of @xmath120 for which there is a solution for @xmath114 . 
 this is the value selected by the cascade dynamics ! in other words , is an eigenvalue equation : @xmath120 is the eigenvalue and @xmath114 is the eigenfunction . 
 this eigenvalue equation circumvents the full nonlinear equation and thus , represents a significant simplification . 
 the physical interpretation of involves a cascade process in which the solid angle undergoes a creation - annihilation process @xmath124 here , @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 . 
 there is one annihilation process and two creation processes . 
 these processes have relative weights that reflect the powerlaw decay of @xmath7 . at the steady - state , 
 the creation and the annihilation terms balance ( see appendix [ stationary ] ) , as reflected in the integrated form of @xmath128.\ ] ] to achieve a steady - state , @xmath129 for @xmath57 and therefore @xmath130 . 
 since @xmath131 , we have the lower bound @xmath132 . 
 we can immediately check that for elastic collisions , @xmath133 @xcite because @xmath96 , and therefore , we conclude the bounds @xmath134 . 
 the exponent @xmath120 varies continuously with the restitution coefficients @xmath135 and 
 @xmath136 and the normalized moment of inertia @xmath91 . this quantity must coincide with the value found for frictionless particles where tangential restitution is irrelevant ( @xmath35 ) @xcite , but otherwise the exponent is distinct , as shown in fig . 
 [ exponent ] . also , the exponent @xmath120 increases monotonically with @xmath135 and @xmath137 . 
 we conclude that the rotational degrees of motion do affect the power - law behavior .     for hard spheres ( @xmath44 ) as a function of the coefficients of normal , @xmath135 , and tangential , @xmath136 , restitution coefficients . 
 the numerical procedure for solving is detailed below.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the azimuthal angle @xmath138 characterizes the fraction of energy stored in the rotational mode , @xmath139 with @xmath140 . 
 the angle distribution @xmath141 therefore captures the partition of energy into rotational and translational energies . 
 we introduce the natural variable @xmath142 defined by @xmath143 so that @xmath144 and present results for the angle distribution @xmath145 . in equilibrium , energy is partitioned equally into all degrees of freedom and therefore @xmath146 or equivalently , @xmath147 for @xmath142 . in particular , @xmath148 . 
 we numerically studied the angle distribution @xmath3 by solving the linear eigenvalue equation for the `` angular '' process and by solving the full nonlinear boltzmann equation for the collision process . 
 both of these equations are solved using monte carlo simulations . 
 the eigenvalue equation is solved by mimicking the angular process . throughout the simulation , 
 the value @xmath120 is fixed . 
 there are @xmath149 particles , each with a given polar angle . 
 a particle with polar angle @xmath76 is picked at random and then , a random azimuthal angle @xmath77 is drawn . 
 the polar angles @xmath150 and @xmath151 are then calculated according to . 
 the original particle is annihilated with probability @xmath152 and simultaneously , a new particle with angle @xmath150 is created with probability @xmath153 and similarly , a second particle with angle @xmath151 is created with probability @xmath154 . therefore , the number of particles may increase by one , remain unchanged , or decrease by one . 
 the exponent @xmath120 is the value that keeps the total number of particles constant in the long time limit . 
 the eigenvalue @xmath120 is calculated by repeating this simulation for various values of @xmath120 and then using the bisection method @xcite . 
 we present monte carlo simulations of @xmath155 independent realizations with @xmath156 particles .    driven steady - states are obtained by simulating the two competing processes of inelastic collisions and energy injection . in an inelastic collision , two particles are picked at random and also , the impact direction is chosen at random . 
 the particle velocities are updated according to the collision law . 
 collisions are executed with probability proportional to the collision rate . throughout this process , we keep track of the total energy loss . with a small rate , 
 we augment the energy of a randomly selected particle by an amount equal to the loss total and subsequently , reset the total energy loss to zero 
 . a fraction of the injected energy is rotational and the complementary fraction is translational . 
 we draw this fraction according to the equilibrium distribution . 
 we experimented with different angle distributions and found that the resulting stationary state did not change .    obtaining 
 the distribution @xmath3 is generally challenging as it requires excellent statistics . 
 the simulations are most efficient for maxwell molecules because all possible collisions are equally likely . 
 therefore , for the full nonlinear boltzmann equation , we present the angle distribution of the energetic particles only for the case @xmath45 .    for maxwell molecules , the injection rate is @xmath157 and the system size is @xmath156 . 
 the corresponding values for hard spheres are @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in all cases , 
 the simulation results represent an average over @xmath160 independent realizations . unless noted otherwise , the simulation results are for maximally dissipative ( @xmath161 ) disks ( @xmath162 ) . 
 the numerical simulations confirm several of our theoretical predictions . 
 first , the energy distribution approaches a steady - state with a power - law high - energy tail . 
 second , the distribution of the total energy @xmath7 decays algebraically as in . 
 third , the exponent @xmath120 is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the eigenvalue equation . for maxwell molecules , monte carlo simulation of the full nonlinear equation yields @xmath163 whereas numerical solution of the eigenvalue equation gives @xmath164 ( fig . 
 [ tail - maxwell ] ) . 
 for hard - spheres , where the simulation results are slightly less accurate , the corresponding values are @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( fig . [ tail - hard ] ) . 
 the behavior of the distribution of _ total _ energy is therefore qualitatively similar to the behavior in the no - rotation case @xcite . 
 however , the quantitative behavior is different because the exponent @xmath120 does depend on the tangential restitution coefficient and the moment of inertia ( fig . 
 [ exponent ] ) .    ]    ]      the numerical simulations also confirm several of our theoretical predictions concerning the angle distribution . 
 extremely energetic particles have a _ 
 universal _ distribution @xmath3 . 
 this distribution is independent of the energy , provided that the energy is sufficiently large . 
 we had to probe only the most energetic particle out of roughly @xmath167 particles to measure this distribution . 
 for this reason , the linear analysis and the resulting eigenvalue equation are valuable because they allow for an accurate and efficient determination of the angle distribution of the energetic particles . 
 we also verified that the distribution @xmath3 obeys the eigenvalue equation , as demonstrated in fig . 
 [ angle - maxwell ] , where the simulations are compared to the solution of the angular process .     for various collision parameters ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) for maxwell molecules.[angle - galery ] ]     for various collision parameters ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) for maxwell molecules.[angle - galery ] ] 
 the distribution @xmath3 has several noteworthy features . 
 first , it is not uniform , implying the breakdown of energy equipartition in a granular gas . 
 furthermore , this distribution is _ 
 nonanalytic_. it contains singularities and discontinuous derivatives . 
 there are notable peaks in the distribution so that special values @xmath4 and special ratios @xmath168 are strongly preferred . 
 the reason for these peaks is the fact that the polar angle is limited . 
 for example , @xmath169 as seen by substituting @xmath170 into and . 
 consequently , there is a special ratio @xmath171 with the corresponding special energy ratio @xmath172 . 
 this is the most pronounced peak in fig . 
 [ angle - maxwell ] , . 
 numerically , we observe that the peak becomes more pronounced as the distribution is measured at a finer scale , indicating that the distribution function diverges at this point . 
 similarly , there is another special ratio that corresponds to @xmath150 when @xmath170 , and unlike , this location depends on the tangential restitution , @xmath173 indeed , there is a barely noticeable cusp at @xmath174 . 
 singularities may induce less pronounced `` echo''-singularities . 
 for example , using @xmath175 and @xmath176 yields the special ratio @xmath177 ^ 2+[1+\eta_t(1 - 1/q)]^2}}.\ ] ] there is a noticeable peak at the corresponding value @xmath178 in fig . 
 [ angle - maxwell ] . 
 we anticipate that as the transformation is iterated , the strength of the singularities weakens and as a result there are discontinuous derivatives of increasing order , a subtle behavior that is difficult to measure .     of all particles for maxwell molecules ( solid line ) . 
 also shown for reference is the uniform equilibrium distribution ( broken line).[angle - all ] ]     of all particles for maxwell molecules ( solid line ) . 
 also shown for reference is the uniform equilibrium distribution ( broken line).[angle - all ] ]    the location of the singularities varies with the collision parameters @xmath135 and @xmath136 and the moment of inertia @xmath91 . in fact , the angle distribution is extremely sensitive to material properties as its shape changes dramatically with these parameters , see fig . 
 [ angle - galery ] . 
 the angle distribution also depends on the collision rate and it is much smoother for hard spheres , see fig .  [ angle - hard ] . 
 since the collision rate vanishes for grazing collisions , @xmath179 , the associated singularities including in particular are suppressed . 
 nevertheless , there is a pronounced jump at the special ratio given by and there are also noticeable cusps . 
 the angle distribution of all particles @xmath180 is shown in fig . 
 [ angle - all ] . 
 it is substantially different from @xmath3 . 
 therefore , the energy distribution @xmath106 does not factorize in general and there are correlations between the solid angle and the total energy . only for energetic particles 
 does hold . 
 moreover , @xmath181 is much smoother in comparison with @xmath3 although there is a jump in the first derivative at the special ratio showing that the angle distribution of all particles is also non - analytic , see fig . 
 [ angle - all ] . generally , the angle distribution depends on energy and the deviation from a uniform distribution grows with energy . 
 we also comment that lone measurement of the moment @xmath182 can be misleading . 
 the angle distribution may very well have a value close to the equipartition value @xmath183 but still , be very far from the equilibrium distribution . indeed , in fig . 
 [ angle - maxwell ] , @xmath184 , a value that barely differs from the equilibrium value , even though the corresponding distribution is far from uniform . 
 the second moment may also differ substantially from the equipartition value and for example , @xmath185 when @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( fig . 
 [ angle - galery ] ) . 
 we argue that the qualitative features of the angle distribution should be generic in granular materials . 
 collisions involving energetic particles must follow the linear cascade rules with the angular transformations . 
 the singularities are a direct consequence of these transformations and therefore should be generic . measuring the parameter - sensitive distribution @xmath3 experimentally is challenging because a huge number of particles must be probed and the measurement has to be accurate . 
 the distribution @xmath181 provides a detailed probe of the partition of energy into rotational and translation motion . 
 we now consider freely cooling granular gases that evolve via purely collisional dynamics . without energy input , all energy is eventually dissipated and the particles come to rest . 
 this system has been studied extensively @xcite for hard spheres with @xcite and without rotation @xcite . 
 we consider maxwell molecules where in the absence of rotation an exact treatment is possible @xcite . 
 when @xmath45 the boltzmann equation ( [ nonlinear ] ) simplifies @xmath188.\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] consequently , the equations for the moments @xmath189 close .      here 
 , we consider only the translational temperature defined as the average translational energy , @xmath190 , and the rotational temperature , defined as the average rotational energy @xmath191 . 
 these two temperatures are coupled through the linear equation @xmath192 appendix [ coefficents ] details the derivation of the matrix of coefficients    [ lambda ] @xmath193    the two temperatures are coupled as long as @xmath194 or alternatively , @xmath195 . 
 the solution of is a linear combination of the two eigenvectors @xmath196 with the constants @xmath197 and @xmath198 set by the initial conditions , and @xmath199 . 
 the eigenvalues are @xmath200 the larger eigenvalue is irrelevant in the long time limit and therefore , @xmath201 such that both temperatures decay with the same rate @xmath202 . 
 of course , the total temperature also follows the same exponential decay , . in this regime , 
 the fraction of rotational energy is on average @xmath203 the approach toward this value is exponentially fast and the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the difference in eigenvalues @xmath204 .    in equilibrium , @xmath205 but for nonequilibrium granular gases the ratio varies . in fig . 
 8 we plot the ratio of the average rotational energy to the total energy as a function of the coefficients of restitution . in accordance with our findings for driven steady - states , energy is not partitioned equally between all the degrees of freedom . 
 to study the full energy distribution , it is again convenient to make a transformation of variables from the velocity pair @xmath51 to the total energy and the solid angle @xmath206 . 
 the energy distribution is now time dependent and assuming that the temperature 
 @xmath207  is the characteristic energy scale we postulate the self - similar form @xmath208 with the prefactor ensuring proper normalization , @xmath209 . 
 we focus on the high - energy behavior where the linear equation ( [ linear ] ) holds . by substituting the scaling form ( [ scaling ] ) into this linear equation and setting @xmath45 
 , we find the integro - differential equation governing the scaling function @xmath210.\end{aligned}\ ] ] we again write the multivariate energy distribution as a product @xmath211 of the distribution of the total energy @xmath212 and the distribution of the solid angle @xmath114 . 
 this form is a solution of the equi - dimensional equation ( [ phi - eq ] ) when the distribution of the total energy decays as a power - law @xmath213 at large energies , @xmath214 . 
 the angle distribution satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath215 \delta(\omega-\omega_0)\big\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] of course , setting @xmath216 , one recovers the steady - state equation reflecting that the similarity solution is stationary . 
 the factor @xmath217 is replaced by the smaller factor @xmath218 that accounts for the constant decrease in the number of particles at any given energy because of dissipation . 
 again , we have a nonlinear eigenvalue equation with the eigenvalue @xmath120 and the eigenfunction @xmath114 . 
 particles . a dashed line with the slope predicted by the theory is also shown for reference.[energy - free],title=""fig : "" ] [ temperature - ratio ]     particles . a dashed line with the slope predicted by the theory is also shown for reference.[energy - free ] ]    we solve this eigenvalue equation by performing a monte carlo simulation of the same angular process as described by but with a different annihilation rate @xmath219 . 
 we compare the angle distribution predicted by with the behavior of the energetic particles in the freely cooling gas . 
 the numerical simulations of the inelastic collision process confirm the theoretical predictions . 
 first , the energy distribution is self - similar as in and the characteristic scale is proportional to the temperature . 
 second , the distribution of the total energy has a power - law tail , as displayed in fig . 
 [ energy - free ] and the exponent @xmath120 is very close to the theoretical prediction ( numerical simulations of the collision process gives @xmath220 while the eigenvalue equation yields @xmath221 ) . 
 the angle distribution deviates even more strongly from the uniform distribution with a very pronounced peak ( see fig .  [ angle - free ] ) because the dynamics are purely collisional . 
 the singularities are weaker although the one at @xmath222 given by is clear . 
 the agreement between the solution of the angular process and the monte carlo simulations is slightly worse than for driven systems because the statistics become prohibitive : now it is necessary to probe the most energetic out of roughly @xmath223 particles to obtain the asymptotic angle distribution ! 
 the sharper power - law decay is responsible for this three order of magnitude increase : the cumulative distribution of total energy decays according to @xmath224 with @xmath225 about three times larger than before . 
 finally , the angle distribution of all particles deviates only slightly from a uniform distribution ( see fig .  [ angle - free - all ] ) . 
 we conclude that the behavior of the freely cooling gas is qualitatively similar to that found in driven steady - states .    ]    ] 
 the complete description of granular media with translational and rotational degrees of freedom requires the full bivariate distribution of energies . 
 it is not sufficient to consider only the average kinetic energy of translations and rotations . 
 instead the full bivariate distribution is highly nontrivial . 
 we have shown that in the limit of large particle energy , this distribution obeys a linear equation . its solution can be written as a product of two distributions , one for the total energy , @xmath15 , and one for the variable @xmath1 , which captures the partition of the total energy between rotational and translational motion . 
 the distribution of the total energy decays algebraically and the characteristic exponent depends on the collision parameters and the moment of inertia . 
 the variable @xmath4 is not uniformly distributed as in equilibrium . 
 instead the distribution @xmath3 is not analytic and displays a series of singularities of varying strengths . 
 remarkably , there are special preferred ratios of rotational - to - total energy . 
 this violation of energy equipartition among different degrees of freedom is a direct consequence of the energy dissipation . 
 the total energy and the variable @xmath4 are correlated in general with the deviations from equilibrium increasing with energy . 
 these two variable become uncorrelated only at extremely high - energies . 
 we have studied both , the system which is driven at extremely high energies and displays a stationary energy cascade on energy scales below the driving one , and a freely cooling gas . in the latter gas 
 the bivariate energy distribution is time dependent , reflecting the overall decrease of energy . 
 nevertheless , scaling the total energy with temperature , one finds a self - similar form for the distribution , which again factorizes in the high - energy limit . as in the driven system 
 , the distribution of the total energy decays as a power law with , however , different exponents for the driven and the free cooling system . 
 the angular distribution deviates even more from the uniform ( equipartition ) one in the cooling system 
 .    it should be straightforward to extend these results to three dimensions where the angular process takes place in three dimensions . in the limit of high energies one 
 would again expect a limiting distribution for the partition angle @xmath1 . 
 another possible extension refers to a more realistic law of friction , including coulomb friction @xcite . finally , it would be of interest to extend the analysis to other systems , where equipartition is violated . 
 an example is a binary mixture , where the energy is shared unequally between the two components .

47,"optimal feedback controls for evolutionary control systems are of significant practical importance . differently from open - loop optimal controls , 
 they do not rely on knowledge of the initial condition and they can achieve design objectives , as for instance stabilisation , also in the presence of perturbations . 
 furthermore , the online synthesis of feedback control can be implemented in a real - time setting . 
 it is well - known that their construction relies on special hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations , see for instance @xcite . 
 the solution of the hjb equation is the value function associated to the optimal control problem , and its gradient is used to construct the optimal feedback control . in the very special , but important case of a linear control system with quadratic cost without constraints on the control or the state variables , the hjb equation reduces to a riccati equation which has received a tremendous amount of attention , both for the cases when the control system is related to ordinary or to partial differential equations . 
 otherwise one has to deal with the hjb equation which is a partial differential equation whose spatial dimension is that of the control system . 
 thus optimal feedback control for partial differential equations leads to hjb equations in infinite dimensions @xcite . 
 after semi - discretization in space of the controlled partial differential equation ( pde ) , the hjb equation is posed in a space of dimension corresponding to the spatial discretization of the pde @xcite . for standard finite element or finite difference discretizations this leads to high - dimensional hjb equations . 
 this is one of the instances which is referred to as _ the curse of dimensionality _ @xcite . 
 many attempts to tackle the difficulties posed for numerically solving the hjb equations arising in optimal control have been made in the past or are currently being investigated . 
 we refer , for instance , to @xcite , which mainly focuses on semi - lagrangian schemes , and further references given there . 
 a related approach to numerical optimal feedback control of pdes is to semi - discretize the dynamics and to add a model order reduction step , either with balanced truncation or proper orthogonal decomposition , in order to reduce the dimension of the dynamics to a number that is tractable for grid - based , semi - lagrangian schemes . 
 this approach has been successfully explored , for instance , in @xcite and references therein . 
 it strongly relies on a trustworthy representation of the dynamics via low - dimensional manifolds . 
 such a low - dimensional representation may deteriorate when nonlinear and/or advection effects are relevant . 
 thus , it is important to strive for techniques , or combinations of techniques , which allow to solve higher dimensional problems . 
 another direction of research evolves around generalizing the riccati - based approach to allow for nonlinearities in the state equation . 
 one such technique is termed state - dependent riccati equation @xcite . here 
 the coefficients in the ordinary riccati equation are functions of the state rather than constants as in the case of linear state equations . 
 another approach realizes the fact that the riccati equation can be interpreted as the equation satisfied by the first term arising in the power series expansion of the value function , and attempts to improve by realizing also higher order terms in the expansion . 
 these methods are succinctly explained in @xcite . 
 yet another technique which has received a considerable amount of attention is termed successive galerkin approximation . 
 roughly speaking , the nonlinear hjb equation associated to the continuous - time optimal control problem is solved by means of a newton method . at each iteration , 
 the control law is fixed . 
 this leads to a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation ( ghjb ) which is linear . 
 the iteration is closed by an update of the control law based on the gradient of the value function . 
 this method was intensively investigated in @xcite , see also @xcite , and the references given in these citations . 
 it is worth to mention that the discrete - time counterpart of this method corresponds to the well - known policy iteration or howards algorithm @xcite . 
 the numerical examples in @xcite do not go beyond dimension five , and most , if not all , of the published numerical results for nonlinear hjb equations do not exceed dimension eight @xcite . 
 an alternative sparse grid approach for high - dimensional approximation of hjb equations based on open - loop optimal control has been presented in @xcite , with tests up to dimension six . 
 numerical methods relying on tensor calculus have been shown to perform well in high - dimensional settings where the associated hjb equation is a linear pde @xcite . 
 in the present paper , to solve optimal control problems for certain classes of semilinear parabolic equations we shall proceed as follows . to accommodate the curse of dimensionality , the discretization of the pde is based on a pseudospectral collocation method , allowing a higher degree of accuracy with relatively few collocation points . to solve the resulting hjb we utilize a newton method based on the ghjb equation as described above . 
 next , the discretization of the ghjb equation is addressed through a galerkin approximation with polynomial , globally supported , ansatz functions . 
 while this mitigates the curse of dimensionality in terms of removing the mesh structure , it leads to high - dimensional integrals . 
 we therefore resort to separable representations for the system dynamics and for the basis set of the polynomial approximation . 
 the separability assumption reduces the computation of the galerkin residual equation to products of one - dimensional integrals . 
 the combination of these procedures allowed us to solve hjb equations related to nonlinear control systems up to dimension fourteen by means of basic parallelization tools . 
 the successful use of the newton procedure requires to provide a feasibly initialization , i.e. a sub - optimal , stabilizing control . 
 since we do not consider constraints , this is not restrictive for finite horizon problem , but can be challenging for infinite horizon problems , and specifically for the stabilization problems which are considered in the present paper . in this respect 
 we developed a continuation procedure based on the use of a discount factor . 
 specifically , we consider a nested iterative procedure : within the outer loop the value of a positive discount factor is driven to zero , within the inner loop the hjb equation is solved approximately for a fixed discount factor . with this approach , which , is summarized in algorithms [ alg : sga1 ] and [ alg : sga2 ] below 
 , we managed to solve optimal feedback stabilization problems for semilinear parabolic equations with different stability behavior of the desired steady state . 
 let us give a brief outline of the paper . 
 section 2 sets the stage and provides the discussion of a special case to facilitate the understanding of the following material . in section 3 
 the solution process of the hjb equation is detailed . in section 4 
 we provide the formulas which are needed to numerically realize the discretized hjb equation after a separable basis has been chosen . 
 numerical experiments are documented in section 5 . there 
 we can also find comparisons to suboptimal feedback strategies based on riccati and asymptotic expansion techniques . 
 we consider the following undiscounted infinite horizon optimal control problem :    @xmath0 subject to the nonlinear dynamical constraint @xmath1 where we denote the state @xmath2 , the control @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , the state running cost @xmath5 , and the control penalization @xmath6 . 
 furthermore , we assume the running cost and the system dynamics @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be @xmath9 . throughout it 
 is assumed that @xmath10 and @xmath11 . 
 our focus is therefore asymptotic stabilization to the origin . 
 it is well - known that the optimal value function @xmath12 characterizing the solution of this infinite horizon control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation @xmath13 with @xmath14 . 
 here we follow the convention of dropping the subscript of @xmath15 . 
 we study this equation in the unconstrained case , i.e. , @xmath16 , where the explicit minimizer @xmath17 of is given by @xmath18 note that by inserting this expression for the optimal control in , we obtain the equivalent hjb equation @xmath19 which under further assumptions can be simplified to the riccati equation associated to linear - quadratic infinite horizon optimal feedback control . 
 the methodology we present in this work is applicable to systems fitting the aforedescribed setting , although for the sake of simplicity we restrict the presentation by the following choices :    * the control @xmath20 is a scalar variable , i.e. @xmath21 . * 
 the running cost @xmath22 is quadratic , i.e. @xmath23 , with @xmath24 positive - definite , * the control term @xmath25 is a constant vector in @xmath26 .    at this point , 
 our setting differs from the linear - quadratic case as it allows nonlinear dynamics , and nonquadratic state costs . for the numerical scheme that we develop , 
 the following assumption is crucial :    [ as:1 ] the free dynamics @xmath27 are separable in every coordinate @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a tensor - valued function . in the case 
 @xmath31 , then we shall also assume a similar separable structure for @xmath32 .      in the following , 
 we illustrate how the presented framework sets the grounds for a computational approach for approximate optimal feedback controllers for nonlinear pdes . 
 we consider the following optimal stabilization problem :    @xmath33    subject to the semilinear parabolic equation @xmath34\ , , t\in{\mathbb{r}}^+,\\ { \partial_{\xi } x}(-1,t)&={\partial_{\xi } x}(1,t)=0\,,\quad x(\xi,0)=x_0\,.\notag\end{aligned}\ ] ] in this case , the scalar control acts through the indicator function @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . at the abstract level , this corresponds to an infinite - dimensional optimal control problem . 
 a first step towards the application of the proposed framework is the space discretization of the system dynamics , leading to finite - dimensional state space representation . 
 the use of the pseudospectral collocation methods for parabolic equations has been studied in @xcite , and leads to a state space representation of the form @xmath37 where the discrete state @xmath38 corresponds to the approximation of @xmath39 at @xmath40 collocation points @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the coordinatewise power . 
 the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 are finite - dimensional approximations of the laplacian and control operators , respectively . 
 such a discretization of the dynamics directly fulfills the separability required in assumption [ as:1 ] , as the i - th equation of the dynamics reads @xmath46 with a separability degree @xmath47 . 
 it is very important to note that semidiscretization in space of a wide class of time - dependent pdes will lead to finite - dimensional state space representations of this type , thus the applicability of the presented framework is only limited by the dimensionality of the associated hjb equation . 
 this motivates the choice of a pseudospectral collocation method for the discretization , as it is possible to obtain a meaningful representation of the dynamics with considerably fewer degrees of freedom than classical low - order schemes . 
 however , if pseudospectral collocation is not a suitable discretization method for the dynamics , model reduction procedures such as balanced truncation , proper orthogonal decomposition , or reduced basis techniques shall also lead to separable state - space representations . 
 once the finite - dimensional state state space representation is obtained , we proceed to approximate the solution of the associated hjb equation , leading to the optimal feedback controller . 
 we now present a preview of the numerical results of the proposed approach . 
 further details of the numerical scheme will be developed in the forthcoming sections . 
 the system dynamics in , are approximated in 12 collocation points ( 14 with b.c.s ) , and therefore our approximation scheme seeks for a solution of a 12-dimensional hjb equation , which allows the computation of online optimal feedback controllers . 
 we compare our hjb - based controller ( hjb ) to the linear - quadratic controller ( lqr ) obtained by linearization of the system dynamics , and to an approximation method for the hjb equation based on power series expansion ( pse ) @xcite . in figure 
 [ fig : ex1 ] we observe the basic features of the dynamics and the control schemes . 
 the uncontrolled system dynamics ( diffusion+dissipative source term ) are stable , but stabilization is extremely slow . 
 the control algorithms considerably reduce the transient phase 
 . however , the control signals are different , and the hjb - based controller generates a feedback control with reduced overall cost . observe that at the beginning of the time horizon even the signs of the lqr- , pse- , and hjb - based controls differ .    . 
 dynamics are stable but slow .

 in this section , we construct a numerical scheme for the approximation of the hjb equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 . 
 we recall two additional features in this equation which render the application of classical approximation techniques difficult : the absence of a variational formulation , and the minimization with respect to the control variable @xmath51 , which makes the hjb equation fully nonlinear . 
 the simplest numerical approach to these problems is the use of monotone , grid - based discretizations ( finite differences , semi - lagrangian ) , in conjunction with a fixed point iteration for the value function @xmath52 which typically depends on the use of a discount factor . 
 the so - called `` value iteration '' procedure was first presented by bellman in @xcite , and although it has become a standard solution method for low - dimensional hjb equations , it suffers from three major drawbacks . 
 first , the grid - based character of the scheme makes it inapplicable for high - dimensional dynamics , as the total number of degrees of freedom scales exponentially with respect to the dimension of the dynamical system . 
 this corresponds to the most classical statement of the so - called _ curse of dimensionality_. second , the contractive mapping includes a minimization procedure which needs to be solved for every grid point at every iteration . 
 third , the lipschitz constant of the contractive mapping goes to 1 when the discretization parameter goes to 0 , becoming extremely slow for fine - mesh solutions . 
 in order to circumvent these limitations , we develop a numerical scheme combining an iteration on the control variable rather than the value function , together with a polynomial expansion for the value function to mitigate the computational burden associated to mesh - based schemes .      in the following , 
 we revisit the method presented in @xcite , which is referred as successive approximation algorithm . 
 we begin by defining the set of admissible controls . 
 we say that a feedback mapping @xmath53 is admissible on @xmath54 , denoted as @xmath55 , if @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for all @xmath59 . 
 starting from an admissible initial guess @xmath60 , the successive approximation algorithm ( algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] below ) generates the pair @xmath61 which solves equation . 
 algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] corresponds to a newton method for solving equation , and in the linear - quadratic setting it is equivalent to the newton - kleinmann iteration for solving the riccati equation . 
 it can be also directly identified with the policy iteration algorithm for hjb equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , although in this context the usual setting includes a discount factor which relaxes the admissibility assumption , as well as discrete - time dynamics . 
 consequently , it is applied to a bellman equation with no continuous gradient . in both cases , 
 the core ingredient of the algorithm is to generate a decreasing sequence of values @xmath62 by solving an associated sequence of linear problems . in our case 
 this translates into solving , for a given @xmath63 at each iteration , the generalized hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( ghjb ) equation @xmath64 the following result from @xcite summarizes relevant properties of the ghjb equation . 
 [ tghjb ] if @xmath65 is a compact subset of @xmath26 , @xmath66 is lipschitz continuous on @xmath65 and @xmath10 , @xmath67 is strictly increasing in @xmath65 , @xmath6 , and @xmath55 , then :    1 . 
 there exists a unique @xmath68 satisfying . 2 . 
 @xmath69 is a lyapunov function of the controlled system . 
 3 .   @xmath70 , for all @xmath71 . 
 the update @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 . 
 if @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 , then @xmath76 for all @xmath71 . 
 a critical aspect of the successive approximation algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] is its initialization , which requires the existence of an admissible control @xmath60 which in view of means that it asymptotically stabilizes all the initial conditions in @xmath65 . for 
 asymptotically stable dynamics , this is trivially satisfied by @xmath77 . for more general cases , 
 the computation of stabilizing feedback controllers is a challenging task . 
 a partial answer is to consider the stabilizing feedback associated to the linearized system dynamics . 
 however , this feedback is only locally stabilizing , and therefore the identification of a suitable domain @xmath65 where this control law is admissible becomes relevant . for low dimensional dynamics , this has been studied in the context of zubov s method in @xcite . an alternative solution that we propose is to consider a discounted infinite horizon control problem    @xmath78 where the inclusion of the discount factor @xmath79 relaxes the admissibility condition . 
 recently , in @xcite , the link between discounted optimal control and asymptotic stabilization has been discussed , and under certain conditions , the discounted control problem can generate optimal controls that are also admissible for the undiscounted problem . 
 we recall that the associated hjb equation for the infinite horizon optimal control problem is given by @xmath80 and the associated ghjb reads @xmath81 we consequently modify the successive approximation algorithm in order to embed it within a path - following iteration with respect to the discount factor :    for a sufficiently large @xmath79 , this algorithm can be initialized with @xmath82 . 
 continued reduction of the discount factor using hotstart every time when is called with a reduced @xmath79-value , leads to an approximate solution of equation . 
 so far we have discussed the iterative aspects of a computational method for solving hjb equations . 
 we now address the numerical approximation of the ghjb equation . 
 @xmath83 for this purpose , we consider an expansion @xmath84 of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 , with @xmath87 belonging to a complete set of basis functions in @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . 
 in particular , we shall often generate @xmath90 from a multidimensional monomial basis as illustrated in figure [ fig : pol2d ] , which directly satisfies the boundary condition @xmath91 . 
 the coefficients @xmath92 are obtained by imposing the galerkin residual equation @xmath93    the convergence of @xmath94 has been studied thoroughly in @xcite . 
 it follows a power series argument , and requires conditions for uniform convergence of pointwise convergent series , in order to guarantee that @xmath95 for @xmath96 sufficiently large . in our particular case 
 , we further assume that the dynamics @xmath97 are polynomial ( as illustrated in section [ pdesub ] ) . 
 therefore , under the assumptions of theorem 26 in @xcite , by choosing a multidimensional monomial basis ( of degree @xmath98 ) and an admissible control @xmath99 , it can be established that , @xmath100 , @xmath101 such that for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . 
 we now focus on the different terms involved in the approximation of the ghjb equation . 
 since this equation is meant to be solved within the iterative loop described in the previous section , we assume that @xmath63 can be expressed in the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 corresponds to the value function of the previous iteration , approximated with the expansion @xmath107 below we shall write @xmath108 for @xmath109 . 
 we proceed by expanding case by case the different terms of the galerkin residual equation @xmath110    1 . 
 @xmath111 : it is directly verifiable that @xmath112 2 . 
 @xmath113 : by inserting the expansion we obtain @xmath114 and therefore @xmath115 3 . 
 @xmath116 : the relation leads to @xmath117 such that @xmath118 4 . 
 @xmath119 : we further assume that @xmath120 5 . 
 @xmath121 : note that @xmath122 leading to @xmath123 @xmath124 is given by @xmath125    after discretization , the ghjb reduces to a parameter - dependent linear system for @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is given by the expansion of @xmath129 ( terms * 4 ) * and * 5 ) * in the list above ) . 
 under assumption [ as:1 ] concerning the separability of the free dynamics @xmath130 , and with the construction of a separable set of basis functions by taking the tensor product of one - dimensional basis functions as shown in figure [ fig : pol2d ] , the calculation of the @xmath40-dimensional inner products of the galerkin residual equation of the previous section is reduced to the product of one - dimensional integrals . in the following , we provide further details of this procedure .    . adding terms of higher order 
 allows a more accurate solution for nonlinear control problems . 
 we construct the high - order terms by limiting the degree of the monomials . ] 
 the multi - dimensional basis functions + @xmath86 for the expansion of @xmath94 are generated as follows . 
 we start by choosing a polynomial degree @xmath131 , and a one - dimensional polynomial basis @xmath132 . for the sake of simplicity 
 , we consider the monomial basis @xmath133 , but the same ideas apply for other basis , such as orthogonal polynomials . 
 the multidimensional basis is generated as a subset of the @xmath40-dimensional tensor product of one - dimensional basis , such that @xmath134 i.e. , we construct a full multidimensional tensorial basis and then we remove elements according to the approximation degree @xmath135 . the elimination step is fundamental and is twofold . 
 if no elimination is performed , the cardinality of @xmath90 would be @xmath136 , and again one would face the _ curse of dimensionality _ that also affects grid - based schemes . by reducing the set to multdimensional monomials of degree at most @xmath135 , the cardinality @xmath96 of the set @xmath90 
 is given by @xmath137 which replaces the exponential dependence on @xmath40 by a combinatorial one . 
 this formula is evaluated in table [ tab : count ] for different values of interest for @xmath135 and @xmath40 . by considering globally defined polynomial basis functions , the dependence on the dimension 
 is replaced by the combinatorial expression . 
 the dimensional reduction of the basis is particularly significant for low order polynomial approximation ( up to degree 6 ) . a second justification for the way in which we generate the basis set has a control - theoretical inspiration . 
 a well - known result in optimal feedback control is that if the dynamics are linear , and the running cost is quadratic , the value function associated to the infinite horizon control problem ( in the unconstrained case and other technical assumptions ) is a quadratic form , i.e. is of the form @xmath138 , which fits precisely the elements generated for @xmath90 with a monomial basis when @xmath139 and linear elements are eliminated . 
 therefore , our basis can be interpreted as a controlled increment , accounting for the nonlinear dynamics , of the basis required to recover the solution of the control problem associated to the linearized dynamics around the equilibrium point .

 a direct corollary is that in the linear quadratic case , where the linear dynamics are trivially odd - symmetric , @xmath69 is a quadratic form . 
 finally , for the calculation presented in the following , it is important to note that due to the construction procedure , the basis elements directly admit a separable representation @xmath146 where each component @xmath147 . 
 we begin by recalling that @xmath148 where @xmath30 is a tensor - valued function , and that @xmath141 .    as in the previous section , 
 we proceed term by term , to obtain the summands in . 
 the integration is carried over the hyperrectangle @xmath149 .

 otherwise we shall relax this requirement , and only assume that the initial stabilizing controller is given in separable form @xmath163    in this case , we must recompute the term :    * @xmath164 @xmath165 + as for the term @xmath166 , which needs to be computed differently in the first iteration , we can proceed in the same way as for @xmath167 , since both @xmath168 and @xmath130 have the same separable structure , it just takes to assign @xmath169 .      among the expressions developed in the previous subsection 
 , the overall computational burden is governed by the approximation of @xmath170 which requires the assembly of the 5-dimensional tensor @xmath171 . 
 each entry of this tensor is a @xmath40-dimensional inner product , which under the aforementioned separability assumptions is computed as the product of @xmath40 , one - dimensional integrals . 
 thus , the total amount of one - dimensional integrals required for the proposed implementation is @xmath172 . 
 a positive aspect of our approach is that the assembly of tensors like @xmath173 falls within the category of _ embarrassingly parallelizable _ computations , so the cpu time scales down almost directly with respect to the number of available cores . 
 furthermore , @xmath173 can be entirely computed in an offline phase , before entering the iterative loops in algorithms [ alg : sga1 ] and [ alg : sga2 ] . however , for values of interest of @xmath96 and @xmath40 , such as @xmath174 and @xmath175 , table [ tab : count ] indicates that @xmath176 is indeed a very large number . 
 a rough estimate of the cpu time required for the assembly of @xmath173 is given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 corresponds to the time required for the computation of a one - dimensional integral . 
 therefore , it is fundamental for an efficient implementation to reduce @xmath178 to a bare minimum . from closer inspection of the expression 
 , we observe that all the terms can be identified as elements of the tensors @xmath179 @xmath180 both @xmath181 and @xmath182 can be computed exactly with a computer algebra system , or approximated under suitable quadrature rules . 
 we follow this latter approach , implementing an 8-point gauss - legendre quadrature rule . after having computed @xmath181 and @xmath182 , 
 the assembly of reduces to @xmath40 calls to properly indexed elements of these tensors . 
 this approach requires a careful bookkeeping of the separable components of each multidimensional basis function @xmath183 . in this way 
 , an entry of @xmath173 takes of the order of 1e-7 seconds and the overall cpu time is kept within hours for problems of dimension up to 12 . 
 we assess the convergence of the polynomial approximation in a 1d test , with @xmath184 such that the exact solution of equation is given by @xmath185 we implement the path - following version ( algorithm 2 ) , starting with @xmath186 , @xmath187 and a threshold value @xmath188 , a parameter @xmath189 , and an internal tolerance @xmath190 . the relative error for table [ tabtestconv ] 
 is defined as @xmath191 and number of iterations for different polynomial degree approximations are shown in table [ tabtestconv ] and figure [ figconv1d ] .

 the scalar control acts through the indicator function @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the the system is closed under suitable boundary conditions . 
 we choose @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 . 
 the nonlinearity covers both advective , burgers-type , and polynomial source terms . in order to generate a low - dimensional state space representation of the dynamics , 
 we resort to a pseudospectral collocation method with chebyshev polynomials as in @xcite ( for further details we also refer to @xcite . by considering @xmath40 collocation points @xmath203 
 , the continuous state @xmath39 is discretized into @xmath38 , where @xmath204 . 
 the semilinar pde dynamics are thus approximated by the @xmath205dimensional nonlinear ode system @xmath206 where the operators @xmath207 correspond to the finite - dimensional realization of @xmath208 through the chebyshev pseudospectral method . 
 therefore , the number of collocation points governs the dimension of the resulting nonlinear ode system , and consequently determines the dimension of the domain @xmath65 where the associated hjb equation is solved . in the following , 
 tests 1 - 3 are computed in 14 collocation points , which after including boundary conditions lead to a 12 dimensional domain @xmath65 for the hjb equation . 
 test 4 is solved in 14 dimensions . 
 the high - dimensional solver was implemented in matlab , parallelizing the tensors assembly , and tests were run on a muti - core architecture 8x intel xeon e7 - 4870 with 2,4ghz , 1 tb of ram . 
 the matlab pseudoparallelization distributes the tasks among 20 workers . 
 representative performance details are shown in table [ tab : cpu ] . 
 the assembly of high - dimensional tensor that enter the iterative algorithm accounts for over 80% of the total cpu time . 
 this percentage increases when algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] is implemented for asymptotically stable dynamics , as it requires a much lower number of iterations . 
 note that much of the work done during the assembly phase is independent of the dynamics ( see for instance ) , and therefore can be re - used in latter problems , mitigating the overall computational burden .

 we set @xmath209 , and consider a monomial basis up to order 4 as described in section [ sec : comp ] . 
 depending on the dynamics of every example , we will neglect odd - degree basis functions as in remark [ oddeven ] . 
 all the integrals are approximated with an 8 point gauss - legendre quadrature rule . 
 whenever system dynamics are stable at the origin , the value function is obtained from the undiscounted algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] , initialized with @xmath186 . 
 when the dynamics are unstable over @xmath65 , we implement algorithm [ alg : sga2 ] , with @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath210 . 
 the initializing controller is given by the solution of the associated linear - quadratic optimal feedback , as described below . 
 for both implementations , the tolerance of the algorithm is set to @xmath190 . in the following tests , we compare the hjb - based feedback control with respect to the uncontrolled dynamics ( @xmath211 ) , the linear - quadratic optimal feedback ( lqr ) , and the power series expansion type of controller ( pse ) . 
 we briefly describe these controllers . 
 the well - known lqr feedback controller corresponds to the hjb synthesis applied over the linearized system around the origin @xmath212 and results in the optimal feedback control law given by @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the unique self - adjoint , positive - definite solution of the algebraic riccati equation @xmath215 and @xmath216 corresponds to the finite - dimensional approximation of @xmath217 . 
 once this controller has been computed , the high - order pse feedback is obtained as    @xmath218 where @xmath219 corresponds to the lowest order term of the nonlinearity @xmath220.variations of such feedback laws have been discussed in previous publications , see eg . 
 @xcite and references therein . for the burgers equation 
 it was observed numerically in @xcite that this suboptimal nonlinear controller leads to an increased closed - loop stability region with respect to the lqr feedback applied for the linearized dynamics .      in this first test 
 we address nonlinear optimal stabilization of advective - reactive phenomena , by considering a 1d burgers-like model with @xmath221 given by @xmath222    .

 this can be appreciated in the numerical results shown in figure [ fig : test1 ] . 
 for this model , we consider a reduced - order state space representation of 12 states , solving a hjb equation over @xmath226 . 
 the value function is approximated with a monomial basis including both even and odd - degree polynomials up to degree 4 . in figure [ fig : test1 ] we can compare the uncontrolled solution to the lqr- and hjb - controlled solutions , where the lqr decay is significantly slower that the one of the hjb synthesis . 
 the hjb controller stabilizes at a higher speed , which is reflected both in the plots and in the total costs . 
 the hjb controller obtains a reduction of approximately 18% with respect to the lqr cost . 
 more importantly , the control signals differ in sign , magnitude , and speed . 
 such a behavior illustrates the nonlinear character of both the control problem and the feedback law . 
 we now turn our attention to a diffusion equation with nonlinearity @xmath227 ( the case with the reversed inequality sign in front of the cubic term was already treated in subsection [ pdesub ] ) , @xmath228 we close the system with neumann boundary conditions . 
 the origin @xmath229 is an unstable equilibrium of the uncontrolled dynamics . 
 any other initial condition is unstable with finite time blow - up . in this case 
 , feedback controls can only provide local stabilization , and the purpose of this numerical test is to show that hjb - based synthesis leads to an increased closed - loop asymptotic stability region when compared to lqr , and pse controllers . 
 for this purpose , we compute feedback controls with the lqr , pse and hjb approaches , for initial conditions of the form @xmath230 , with @xmath231 . 
 the hjb feedback is computed with , algorithm [ alg : sga2 ] , initialized with nonlinear feedback control law provided by the pse approach . 
 the test is carried out over @xmath226 , and the value function is approximated with monomial basis elements of degree 2 and 4 . 
 numerical results are presented in figure [ fig : test2 ] , for @xmath232 and for a series of increased values of @xmath233 in table [ tabtestcubic ] . 
 as the magnitude of the initial condition grows , the locally stabilizing lqr and pse controllers are not able to prevent the finite blow - up of the dynamics . 
 this eventually also happens for the hjb feedback , but at a much larger value of @xmath233 ( we report the last value @xmath234 until which the hjb control stabilizes the dynamics ) . 
 @xmath227 , @xmath235 +    cccc + controller & @xmath232&@xmath236&@xmath234 + ( lr)1 - 1(lr)2 - 2(lr)3 - 3(lr)4 - 4 + uncontrolled & @xmath224 & @xmath224 & @xmath224 + lqr & 4.14 & @xmath224 & @xmath224 + pse & 4.09 & 14.09 & @xmath224 + hjb & 4.06 & 13.98 & 50.36 +   +      . 
 the diffusion - reaction equation @xmath237 corresponds to a particular case of the so - called schlgl model , whose feedback stabilization has been studied in @xcite . 
 this is a special case of a bistable system with @xmath238 as stable and @xmath239 as unstable equilibria . 
 here we use in an essential manner that we consider neumann boundary conditions . for dirichlet conditions the only equilibrium is the origin . 
 such systems arise for instance in rayleigh - benard convection and describe excitable systems such as neurons or axons . as in the previous example 
 , the reduced state - space is chosen as @xmath226 , and the basis elements for the hjb approach are even degree monomials of degree 2 and 4 . 
 numerical results for the different controllers are shown in figure [ fig : test3 ] . 
 while all the feedback laws effectively stabilize the initial condition @xmath240 to the origin , the hjb feedback has the smallest overall cost @xmath223 . as in test 1 
 , it can be observed that the three feedback strategies have a considerably different transient behavior . 
 note that the lqr controller , which neglects the effect of the nonlinearity @xmath241 , has an increased control magnitude with respect to the nonlinear controllers which are able to account the dissipative effect of the nonlinearity .    .

 this case is more demanding than test 2 , as now the linear part is @xmath244 . 
 however , the performance of the controllers is similar as in test 2 , and the results are summarized in table [ tabtest22 ] . 
 again , the hjb feedback law has an increased closed - loop stability region compared to the lqr and pse controllers .

 for this case , we increase the dimension of the hjb domain to 14 , i.e. , @xmath251 , and the basis functions are monomials of odd and even degree up to 4 . 
 numerical results are shown in figure [ fig : test4 ] , where it can be seen that the hjb controller yields the smaller overall cost @xmath223 . 
 note that the pse controller for this case has a diminished performance as compared even to the lqr controller . 
 this can be explained by the fact that the pse controller only takes into account the lowest order nonlinearity , in this case @xmath252 , neglecting the cubic term . 
 this is a well - known drawback of this controller , and therefore justifies the need of more complex synthesis methods for nonlinear feedback design , such as the proposed hjb approach .    .

 a systematic technique for the computational approximation of hjb equations in optimal control problems related to semilinear parabolic equations was presented . to partially circumvent the curse of dimensionality , 
 the dynamics of the parabolic equation are approximated by a pseudospectral collocation method , and the generalized hjb equation is approximated by separable multi - dimensional basis functions of a given order . 
 the numerical results show that the feedback controls obtained by the proposed methodology differ and improve upon applying riccati approaches to the linearized equations . 
 the generalized hjb approach has been addressed in earlier publications , reporting on numerical results with lower dimensions than here and in part restrained enthusiasm about the numerical performance , possibly due to the lack of a systematic initialization procedure . for the class of problems considered in this paper the results were consistently better than riccati approaches . 
 the use of the discount factor path - following technique as proposed in algorithm 2 is essential for stabilizing to unstable equilibria .

48,"problems of packing and space tiling have fascinated scientists for a very long time . 
 kepler s 1611 essay _ on the six - cornered snowflakes _ is probably one of the earliest publications on the subject . 
 here he conjectured that cubic close packing and hexagonal close packing are the most efficient ways to fill a space using equally sized spheres . 
 it was nt until 1998 that kepler s conjecture was finally announce to be proven ( with 99% degree of confidence ) by thomas hales  @xcite . 
 recent advances in particle synthesis  @xcite have opened the way to the production of colloidal particles that are anisotropic both in shape and surface chemistry . 
 this provides an unlimited number of building blocks that can spontaneously organize into an unprecedented variety of structures with potentially novel functional , mechanical , and optical properties . for these reasons , 
 the problem of efficient packing of nanoparticles is under intense investigation . 
 most of the work on particle crystallization and self - assembly in the last decade has focused on monodisperse  @xcite or polydisperse  @xcite systems of spherical or regularly shaped particles ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) . 
 nevertheless , there are several important cases in which the shape of the single components can not be tailored at will ; however , an efficient packing , or an understanding of the physical properties of these densely compressed systems , is highly desirable . 
 two examples of outstanding problems in this category are the storage of grains  @xcite and protein crystallization  @xcite . 
 both examples can be ideally thought of as two different aspects of the problem of understanding the role of shape in particle packing . in the first case the goal is to efficiently pack a system of randomly - shaped polydisperse grains . in the second case 
 the aim is to crystallize non - spherical , yet equally shaped monodisperse components . 
 the latter case is the focus of the present paper . 
 we want to understand how the ability of particles to form macroscopically ordered crystal structures is affected by their shape . 
 specifically , we analyze how random perturbations from the ideal spherical shape affect the crystallizability of a densely packed system of indistinguishable hard particles . 
 although a few papers have dealt with the thermodynamic behavior of soft / deformable particles as a model for polymer brushes or polymer - coated colloids ( @xcite and references therein ) , to the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first study where shape distortions , frozen onto the particles , are explicitly and systematically accounted for . 
 the problem of crystal formation is poorly understood . from a thermodynamic standpoint , 
 classical nucleation theory informs us that a crystal can only be formed via a barrier crossing event . 
 the free energy gain to form a nucleus of a stable crystalline structure in a supersaturated solution has to balance out the free energy cost associated with the formation of an interface between the solid and the fluid parent phase . 
 the gibbs free energy cost , @xmath0 , associated with this event has a strong dependence on the interfacial free energy , @xmath1 : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and the chemical potential difference between solid and fluid phase , respectively . as @xmath1 is very hard to extract from experiments , 
 computer simulations are the tool of choice to study and analyze this important process in detail 
 .    one way to investigate our problem could be to measure the dependence of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) on the magnitude of the shape perturbations at constant @xmath4 . 
 this approach would be appropriate when considering a system that is polydisperse in shape and size ; however , in our case , we have to study a statistically relevant number of systems each containing @xmath5 identical particles with the same shape perturbation . 
 such an approach is therefore impractical because ( a ) it would require the computation of a phase diagram for every system with a given particle realization ( about 500 in this study ) and ( b ) for sufficiently large shape deformations the fcc structure that nucleates out of a solution of hard spheres may not necessarily be the most stable one , and this would lead to a meaningless comparison of unrelated @xmath1s .    given these limitations , our strategy will be to generate a large number of particle shapes , sort them in terms of the extent of their asphericity , and simply analyze whether they organize into an ordered and periodic structure ( whatever that might be ) once compressed at large densities . 
 we are left with the problem of devising a new model that allows for an effective control of the particle s degree of asphericity . 
 unfortunately there is not a unique way of introducing perturbations on the particle shape , so we have opted for a model that , without loss of generality , weds simplicity and numerical efficiency . 
 in our model , each particle is built by setting the center of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) spheres of diameter @xmath8 at random positions inside a spherical shell of diameter @xmath9 . 
 the overall volume generated from the resulting overlapping aggregate defines our new particle . 
 deviations from the ideal spherical shape can be conveniently controlled by varying @xmath10 and @xmath6 . 
 values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 were chosen to achieve wide coverage of the range of possible particle geometries . for @xmath11 
 one recovers the spherical limit , and as @xmath10 increases , particles develop larger and larger shape distortions . in a similar fashion , 
 large values of @xmath6 result in a bumpy but overall isotropic particle , whereas small values of @xmath6 tend to generate very anisotropic shapes . 
 once a particle is built , the center of mass of this cluster of balls is determined , and the entire cluster is scaled so that its total volume equals that of a spherical particle of diameter @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath12 . any two particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 interact via a hard repulsive potential defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 run over all spheres of rescaled diameter @xmath18 constituting particle @xmath13 and particle @xmath14 respectively . 
 experimental realizations of colloidal particles similar to ours could be generated using the approach described in reference  @xcite to create uniform nonspherical particles with tunable shapes . 
 figure 1 shows a few snapshots of particle shapes obtained for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath10 . 
 and @xmath6 built according to the scheme described in the text.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    to analyze the high density behavior of these systems we used monte carlo simulations in the @xmath19 ensemble . 
 given the large number of simulations involved in this study , we limited the size of our systems to a total of @xmath20 particles . 
 we use a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions . using as a reference the hard - spheres model , i.e. coexistence reduced pressure and volume fraction respectively at @xmath21 and @xmath22 
 , we performed , for each system with a given particle realization , a series of simulations at increasing values of pressure beginning at @xmath23 with a typical increment of @xmath24=0.5 or smaller . 
 we ran each simulation for a minimum of @xmath25 monte carlo sweeps after thermalization . 
 the largest pressure was set by either the crystallization of the system , or by the reaching of a volume fraction @xmath26 , above the glass transition point of hard spheres @xmath27 . 
 crystallization was detected in our samples with a combination of methods : ( a ) standard spherical - harmonics based bond order parameter @xmath28  @xcite , ( b ) a careful monitoring of the system volume fraction over time for sudden jumps , and ( c ) visual inspection . 
 we investigated a total of 487 different particle shapes . 
 we find that at least two order parameters are required to properly characterize the shape of each particle . 
 the first is its asphericity @xmath29 ( as opposed to the commonly used sphericity , @xmath30  @xcite ) , defined in terms of the surface to volume ratio of a particle @xmath31 with respect to that of a sphere of diameter @xmath8 , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 given our model setup , @xmath34 , @xmath29 simplifies to @xmath35    the second parameter , @xmath36 , measures the orientational symmetry of the particle . 
 it is used to describe the asphericity of random walks  @xcite , and it is obtained by combining invariants of the particle inertia tensor @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the three principal eigenvalues of the inertia tensor of the particle , i.e. , the three principle radii of gyration of the particle . both parameters 
 are defined so that they are equal to @xmath42 for a perfectly spherical particle , and approach @xmath43 for extremely aspherical ones . 
 note that @xmath29 depends intimately on the value of @xmath10 used to construct the particle , whereas @xmath36 depends only on the angular distribution of spheres about the center of mass  that is , it is completely independent of @xmath10 . 
 figure  [ plot ] summarizes the main result of our paper .     and @xmath36 . 
 filled circles indicate particles that easily crystallized , while open squares indicate particles that did not . 
 data include results for 487 total particle geometries , including 85 using @xmath44 , 200 using @xmath45 , 92 using @xmath46 , and 110 using @xmath47 . 
 the solid line is a guide to the eye.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is obtained by collecting the crystallizability of the 487 systems built out of the 487 different particle geometries we have generated across the @xmath29 , @xmath36 spectrum . each point in the @xmath29 
 vs @xmath36 diagram represents the result of a set of simulations at different pressures . 
 as would be expected , crystallization is favored when both @xmath29 and @xmath36 are small @xmath48 that is , when the particles are nearly spherical by both measures . 
 a roughly inverse relationship is clearly evident ; particles with large @xmath29 must have very small @xmath36 in order to have a hope of crystallization , and vice - versa . but more importantly 
 , we find the existence of a clear boundary delineating the crystallizability limit for every possible shape generated with our model ( small deviations at the interface are likely due to finite size effects and or the limited length of our simulations ) . 
 this is quite remarkable because it provides a very useful way of predicting whether a particular particle shape can pack into a crystalline structure by simply measuring the experimentally accessible @xmath29 and @xmath36 . 
 we find that a good empirical expression to describe the phase boundary is @xmath49 . 
 this curve is only meant to serve as a guide to the eye and to give an approximate numerical estimate of the location of the phase boundary for @xmath50 . 
 notice that for smaller values of @xmath36 our data seem to indicate a sharp end of the crystal boundary . 
 we believe this to be an artifact of our particle model . 
 in fact , that region is where the value of @xmath10 becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath51 ) to break the compactness of the particles generated with our method , especially those with smaller values of @xmath6 . 
 furthermore , as small values of @xmath36 indicate a large orientational symmetry , we expect this region to be heavily populated by specific geometric arrangements , whose packing properties , at large values of @xmath29 , will be extremely sensitive of the particular value of @xmath6 . 
 as our model is intended to describe randomly shaped particles , our diagram does not include the results for particles designed with very specific shapes such as rods , plates or regular polyhedric geometries that are known to crystallize . 
 these particular cases would generate sharp peaks around specific values of @xmath36 . 
 furthermore , is not clear that our two order parameters , that have after all been selected to describe asphericity , would be the most appropriate to study deviations from an arbitrary non spherical designed shape . 
 we therefore limited our study to @xmath52 , to explicitly avoid trivial cases as rod - like ( @xmath53 ) and plate - like particles ( @xmath54 ) . 
 two obvious questions present themselves in the face of these data . 
 the first is : what is the nature of the crystals formed when particles do easily crystallize ; does the system present translational but not orientational order , as expected for @xmath55 , or does the rotational motion of the particles becomes restricted for large values of @xmath29 ? 
 the second is : what sets the boundary between the two phases ; do the particles that fail to easily crystallize do so because they become kinetically trapped or because of the lack of a stable crystal phase ?    to address the first question 
 , we measured the rotational diffusion , @xmath56 , for 20 systems that easily crystallize , all at a reduced pressure @xmath57 and near the phase boundary . as a reference we also plotted @xmath56 for nearly spherical particles , obtained by setting @xmath58 , where we know particles are free to rotate at their lattice sites . 
 as can be seen in fig . 
 [ rot ] , we find no evidence that particles in the crystalline phase become orientationally arrested or manifest an orientationally anomalous behavior . 
 the only effect is that of decreasing their diffusion constant , but this is expected from simple geometrical considerations . 
 it is obvious that at very large densities , regardless of the specific phase a system selects , particles orientations will manifest a glassy behavior or eventually freeze . 
 @xcite it is therefore of interest to also look at the dynamical properties of those particles in systems do not easily crystallize and are located just across the phase boundary from the ones that do easily crystallize . 
 these results , obtained at the same reduced pressure @xmath59 , are also shown in fig . 
 we find no signature of anomalous dynamics , neither in the rotational ( fig . 
 [ rot ] ) , nor in the translational ( fig . 
 [ trans ] ) degrees of freedom , i.e. such systems behave as regular fluids . 
 this result is by no means conclusive , as a thorough investigation of this last point would require larger system sizes and an event - driven dynamics of the components . 
 our results seem to suggest that what sets the location of the phase boundary is not a sudden slowdown of the dynamics of the system , but more likely an increase of the gibbs free energy difference between the crystalline and the fluid phase , analogously to that found for polydisperse spherical particles  @xcite 
 . it would be interesting to investigate the equilibrium properties and the stability of candidate crystalline structures for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath36 to investigate whether our boundary line coincides with the onset of crystal instability , but for the reasons given above , we have not attempted to do so . 
 apart from the details concerning the dynamics of these systems , our results show that , for aspherical particles , shape and crystallizability can be directly and easily correlated when particles are characterized in terms of their asphericity via @xmath36 and @xmath29 . 
 it is possible that for some highly asymmetric particle geometries a non - cubic box would accommodate crystallization whereas a cubic one would not ; however , we believe this is a secondary effect and its relevance is likely within the range of errors due to finite size effects . 
 our data suggest precise limits for the manufacture of nanocomponents expected to crystallize , and may have important implications for the problem of protein crystallization . 
 the latter system is clearly far more complex than the one we explored , since not only shape , but also interparticle direct interactions ( which are not necessarily isotropic ) , are responsable for the organization of proteins into large macroscopic crystals . 
 nevertheless , it would be interesting to systematically explore to what extent a similar correlation exists in this case .

49,"the density matrix was first introduced by dirac  [ 1 ] , and after it was generalized by husimi  [ 2 ] and lwdin  [ 3 ] ( the reduced density matrix ) . 
 this was recognized as a very useful tool to investigate interacting many - body theory , and it gave various important concepts until now . 
 the definition of the one - particle density matrix is given as @xmath6 here @xmath2 and @xmath7 are 2-component electron field and its hermitian conjugate , respectively . on the other hand , the density functional theory ( dft ) was first given by hohenberg - kohn - sham  [ 4 ] , and it was developed by many researchers . 
 people applied dft to various many - fermion systems , not only many - electron systems like atoms , molecules and solids , but also nuclear systems . 
 today , dft is well accepted , and used to investigate various physical and chemical characters of systems  [ 5@xmath87 ] . 
 the symmetry aspect of dft was also discussed by using the one - particle local @xmath9 matrix density : @xmath10 by using ( 2 ) , grling examined the symmetry of the hohenberg - kohn theorem in detail  [ 8 ] . 
 weiner and trickey investigated the group theoretical classification of nonrelativistic dft solutions  [ 9 ] , based on the work of fukutome in which the classification for generalized hartree - fock ( ghf ) theory was presented  [ 10 ] . 
 yamanaka et al .  [ 11 ] applied the generalized spin orbital ( gso ) dft to various molecular systems and studied the symmetry breaking phenomena in dft solutions . 
 we should mention also , it was demonstrated that the hohenberg - kohn theorem varid for one - particle density matrix functional @xmath11 $ ]  [ 12@xmath815 ] . 
 dft for time - dependent phenomena was also investigated ( the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) ) . 
 runge and gross examined the hohenberg - kohn theorem for time - dependent external potential ( the runge - gross theorem )  [ 16 ] . 
 tddft was applied to estimation of electronic excitation or susceptibilities  [ 17 ] .    by the way , 
 the first generalization of relativistic hohenberg - kohn theorem was introduced by rajagopal - callaway  [ 18 ] , and several attempts were made to investigate relativistic density functional theory ( rdft )  [ 19@xmath824 ] . 
 based on these studies , an important review of rdft was presented by eschrig et al .  [ 25 ] . 
 today , the hohenberg - kohn - sham scheme is well established for rdft  [ 26@xmath828 ] . 
 relativistic time - dependent density functional theory ( rtddft ) was also investigated  [ 29,30 ] .    in this note 
 we investigate quantum electrodynamical density - matrix functional theory ( qed - dmft ) , and its group theoretical aspects . 
 recently , we constructed the theory of quantum electrodynamical self - consistent fields ( qed - scf )  [ 31 ] . 
 we derived the time - dependent hartree - fock ( qed - tdhf ) theory , hartree - fock condition and random phase approximation ( qed - rpa ) . 
 we also presented the group theoretical classification of quantum electrodynamical hartree - fock ( qed - hf ) solutions  [ 32 ] . based on our previous results , in this work 
 we apply the group - theoretical method to qed - dmft . 
 our theory can become a basis or a starting point to investigate the phenomena of symmetry breaking in many - body system  [ 9@xmath811,33 ] under strong relativistic effects , by using dft framework . in the work of yamanaka et al .  [ 
 11 ] , the results indicate that the gso treatment of dft is very important and usuful for description of some polyradical clusters . therefore , it is interesting for us to extend their treatment to the relativistic framework , and study the phenomena of symmetry breaking in heavy elements , analogous with the nonrelativistic ghf theory  [ 10 ] . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 ii , we introduce qed - dmft . here , `` matrix '' means a matrix in spinor space . 
 in fact , we do not use a non - local one - body matrix like @xmath12 in nonrelativistic case , rather we intend to discuss a local one - body matrix like @xmath13 in nonrelativistic case for obtaining simple classification under group operations . 
 the relation between various available dft and qed - dmft is also discussed . quantum electrodynamical time - dependent density - matrix functional theory ( qed - tddmft ) 
 is also investigated . in sec . 
 iii , the group theoretical classification of qed - dmft solutions is discussed . 
 the results can be applied to elucidate the phenomena of broken symmetry , especially in atomic systems under relativistic effects . finally in sec . 
 iv , possible extensions and applications of qed - dmft are discussed . 
 conclusion with summary of this work is also presented . 
 in this subsection , we introduce qed - dmft . 
 first , we give a brief summary of qed . 
 we start from the following lagrangian : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is a ( virtual ) photon field which describes the interaction between fermions , and @xmath16 is a classical external field . @xmath17 . 
 @xmath18 is the bare mass of fermion , @xmath19 is the dirac field , @xmath20 is its dirac conjugate . 
 @xmath21 indicates time - space coordinate . 
 the @xmath22-matrices are defined by ( under the standard representation ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unit matrix , and @xmath25 ( i=1,2,3 ) is the pauli matrix : @xmath26 the hamiltonian for a qed system becomes @xmath27 where , @xmath16 is a classical field , while others are quantized . 
 @xmath28 is a hamiltonian for electromagnetic field . 
 if we descibe the interaction between fermions by using a photon propagator , we get @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a full photon propagator . 
 quantized fermion - field operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be expanded by one - particle state functions as @xmath33 where @xmath34 means the electron ( positron ) state , @xmath35 denotes quantum numbers for one - particle state , @xmath36 is electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath37 is positron creation ( annihilation ) operator , and @xmath38 is the four - component bispinor given like @xmath39 where , @xmath40 indicates the transposition of a matrix . 
 after these preliminaries given above , we investigate the qed - dmft . 
 for our aim , first we introduce the one - particle local density matrix : @xmath41 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are usual dirac field , and they are 4-component bispinors . 
 thus our density matrix is 4@xmath424 matrix , as denoted above . 
 we can expand the 4@xmath424 density matrix into the 16-dimensional complete set of @xmath22-matrices : @xmath43 in this expansion , we take a convention as @xmath44 denotes the scalar , @xmath45 denotes the vector , @xmath40 denotes the 2-rank antisymmetric tensor , @xmath46 denotes the axial vector and @xmath47 denotes the pseudoscalar . 
 @xmath24 is the @xmath0 unit - matrix , @xmath48 is usual dirac gamma matrix , @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 $ ] , and @xmath51 . 
 hence we obtain the lorentz structure in our density matrix @xmath52 . 
 each component of the expansion in ( 12 ) is given as follows : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . 
 therefore , @xmath4 includes a larger amount of informations than 4-current @xmath58 . 
 it is clear from the discussion given above , if @xmath4 is given , then @xmath59 and also other components can be calculated .    the rayleigh - ritz variation principle of qed - dmft should be given rather straightforward extension of available theory , like the situation of the generalization of the hohenberg - kohn theorem to 4-current rdft  [ 7,14,18,25,26 ] . 
 the exact energy functional of n - representable @xmath4 for ground state of a qed system ( strictly spearking , the particle number @xmath60 is not conserved in qed , but the total charge is conserved , as denoted in ( 15 ) . ) is given in the following form : @xmath61 & = & \langle \psi^{q}|\hat{h}'|\psi^{q}\rangle \nonumber \\           & = & f[q(x ) ] + \int d^{3}x j^{\mu}({\bf x})a^{ext}_{\mu}({\bf x}).\end{aligned}\ ] ] here , we use the hamiltonian @xmath62 given in ( 7 ) . 
 now @xmath63 is a static external field . 
 here we only consider a stationary problem . 
 variational search of the minimum point of the functional should be performed under constraint : @xmath64 first equation is arised from the gauge invariance of the theory derived by nther theorem , while second one expresses the charge conservation . 
 the fundamental theorems of dft proved by levy are constructed by two points  [ 14 ] : ( i ) the variation principle can be applied to the ground state energy functional @xmath65 $ ] or @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the one - particle density while @xmath68 is the one - particle ( so called first - order ) density matrix . 
 ( ii ) the ground state of a system can be represented by @xmath67 or @xmath69 for ground state ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) . 
 it is clear from his logic , the theorems do not distinguish between nonrelativistic case and relativistic case , and can be applied to relativistic case . 
 therefore , we argue that our functional @xmath72 $ ] will obey the variation principle and @xmath4 for the ground state ( @xmath73 ) represents the ground state of a qed system . 
 thus @xmath74 & = & \min_{\psi\to q}\langle\psi|\hat{t}+\hat{v}_{f - f}|\psi\rangle , \\ e[q ] & = & \min_{q}\bigl\{f[q]+\int d^{3}x j^{\mu}({\bf x})a_{\mu}({\bf x})\bigg|\int d^{3}x j_{0}({\bf x})=const . 
 \bigr\},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the kinetic energy while @xmath76 is the interaction between fermions , presented in the hamiltonian ( 7 ) 
 .    next step of our plan is the investigation into the kohn - sham scheme in our theory . 
 the energy functional is devided into the following form : @xmath61 & = & t_{s}[q(x)]+\int d^{3}x j^{\mu}({\bf x})a^{ext}_{\mu}({\bf x})+\frac{1}{2}\int d^{3}x \int d^{3}x'\frac{j^{\mu}({\bf x})j_{\mu}({\bf x}')}{|{\bf x}-{\bf x}'|}+e_{xc}[q(x ) ] . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] here , @xmath77 $ ] is the one - particle kinetic energy functional @xmath78=\int d^{3}x\sum_{-m<\epsilon_{n}\le\epsilon_{f}}\bar{\psi}_{n}(-i\vec{\gamma}\cdot\nabla+m_{0})\psi_{n},\end{aligned}\ ] ] and the 4-current @xmath79 is given as @xmath80 where , @xmath81 is the kohn - sham one - body function in our theory . 
 $ ] is the exchange - correlation energy functional in our theory . 
 the definition of @xmath82 $ ] is given as @xmath83 & = & f[q(x)]-t_{s}[q(x)]-\frac{1}{2}\int d^{3}x \int d^{3}x'\frac{j^{\mu}({\bf x})j_{\mu}({\bf x}')}{|{\bf x}-{\bf x}'|}. \end{aligned}\ ] ] the third term of the right hand side of ( 18 ) is a hartree - like term . 
 this term arises if we replace @xmath30 of ( 7 ) to the 0-th order photon propagator of the feynman gauge : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is usual metric tensor and defined as @xmath86 . 
 therefore , the third term of ( 18 ) includes gauge parameter . 
 @xmath87 has to include contributions to compensate the gauge dependence of the hartree - like term , for retaining the gauge invariance of the theory . from the variation with respect to the one - particle function 
 , we obtain the dirac - kohn - sham equation in our theory : @xmath88}{\delta q^{s}(x ) } = \delta m + \alpha({\bf x } ) , \\ v^{v}_{\mu}({\bf x } ) = a^{ext}_{\mu}({\bf x})+\int d^{3}x'\frac{j_{\mu}({\bf x}')}{|{\bf x}-{\bf x}'|}+\frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{v}_{\mu}(x ) } , \\ v^{t}_{\mu\nu}({\bf x } ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{t}_{\mu\nu}(x ) } , \\ v^{a}_{\mu}({\bf x } ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{a}_{\mu}(x ) } , \\ v^{p}({\bf x } ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{p}(x)}.      \end{aligned}\ ] ] because our energy functional depends on the matrix @xmath4 , generally we obtain 16-component fictitious potentials . from the symmetry consideration , 
 it is clear that , scalar potential @xmath89 gives the mass correction @xmath90 , which will arises from radiative corrections . 
 @xmath91 appears also in usual 4-current rdft  [ 7,26 ] . 
 in fact , qed - dmft is a non - perturbative method in qed . 
 it is a famous fact that , qed becomes finite if its calculation fulfills the requirement of the gauge invariance  [ 34 ] ( though we should employ gauge - invariant regularization and renormalization ) . 
 therefore , if we can perform a calculation under retaining gauge invariance exactly , we will obtain a finite value for qed - dmft . 
 now , we discuss the relation between various dft , as depicted in fig 
 if we take into account only the components of 4-current @xmath92 in the expansion ( 12 ) of @xmath4 for qed - dmft energy functional , we obtain quantum electrodynamical current density functional theory ( qed - cdft )  [ 7,25,26 ] . 
 next , under performing the gordon decomposition to spatial components of current @xmath93 ( here @xmath94 is the orbital current density while @xmath95 is the spin density ) , and then completely omit @xmath96 , we obtain relativistic spin density functional theory ( rsdft )  [ 25,28 ] . 
 next , neglect the contribution of @xmath97 for rsdft , then we obtain relativistic density functional theory ( rdft ) . performing some nonrelativistic reduction , 
 especially only take into account the contribution of the large component to rdft , and neglect all relativistic corrections ( spin - orbit , darwin , mass - velocity etc . ) , then we obtain nonrelativistic density functional theory ( nrdft )  [ 5@xmath87 ] . generalizing the nrdft to spin polarized system , we get nonrelativistic spin density functional theory ( nrsdft )  [ 5@xmath87 ] . 
 add the interaction between orbital current and external vector potential @xmath98 to nrsdft , we obtain nonrelativistic current density functional theory ( nrcdft )  [ 35 ] . 
 extension of qed - dmft to the time - dependent region can also be considered . 
 starting point here is the action integral for density functional , like the qed - tdhf  [ 31 ] : @xmath99 = \int^{t_{f}}_{t_{i}}dt\langle\psi^{q}(t)|i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{h}'|\psi^{q}(t)\rangle.\end{aligned}\ ] ] here matrix @xmath100 , depends on time @xmath101 . 
 @xmath102 is given as ( 7 ) . 
 we take the dirac - frenkel variation principle to produce a stationary point at time - dependent density @xmath4  [ 17,31 ] : @xmath103 = \delta \int^{t_{f}}_{t_{i}}dt\langle\psi^{q}(t)|i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{h}'|\psi^{q}(t)\rangle = 0.\end{aligned}\ ] ] therefore we obtain the euler equation : @xmath104}{\delta q_{a}(x_{0},{\bf x})}=0 , \qquad a=1\sim16.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the hohenberg - kohn theorem in time - dependent potential was discussed by runge - gross  [ 16,17 ] for nonrelativistic case , and it was extended by rajagopal  [ 30 ] for relativistic case , in detail . 
 in fact , we simply assume that our functional of @xmath52 can be used to discuss variation principle parallel with their results . 
 the time - dependent dirac - kohn - sham equation in our theory becomes @xmath105}{\delta q^{s}(x ) } = \delta m + \alpha(x ) , \\ 
 v^{v}_{\mu}(x ) = a^{ext}_{\mu}(x)+\int d^{3}x'\frac{j_{\mu}(x')}{|{\bf x}-{\bf x}'|}+\frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta 
 q^{v}_{\mu}(x ) } , \\ v^{t}_{\mu\nu}(x ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{t}_{\mu\nu}(x ) } , \\ v^{a}_{\mu}(x ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta 
 q^{a}_{\mu}(x ) } , \\ v^{p}(x ) = \frac{\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\delta q^{p}(x)}.      \end{aligned}\ ] ] here the effective single - particle kohn - sham potentials are also presented . 
 now , all of them are time - dependent potentials . 
 in this section , we give a discussion of group theoretical classification of the qed - dmft solutions .    in the relativistic theory 
 , we usually treat the poincar group ( 4-translation and the lorentz group ) , charge conjugation , parity ( spatial inversion ) and time - reversal . under the charge conjugation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 
 are transformed as @xmath106 where @xmath40 denotes the transposition of a matrix , @xmath107 is the charge conjugation matrix . then @xmath4 is transformed as @xmath108 under the time reversal , @xmath109 here @xmath110 . then 
 , together with the rule of taking the complex conjugate about c - numbers , we obtain @xmath111 where @xmath112 . 
 @xmath113 is 0-th component of vector while @xmath114 is 0-th component of axial vector . @xmath115 and @xmath116 are space components of vector and axial vector , respectively . under the spatial inversion , 
 @xmath117 @xmath4 is transformed as @xmath118    the qed - dmft solutions can be group theoretically classified into several types . to consider this problem , we determine the symmetry group of a system . in the atomic or molecular systems , 
 the translation invariance is broken . in the case of an atom , 
 only @xmath5 rotation remains in the lorentz group ( in the case of a molecule , @xmath5 is replaced by the point group . ) . under the @xmath5 rotational symmetry , 
 we expand the @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 by the scalar spherical harmonics , while we expand the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath121 by the vector spherical harmonics  [ 36 ] . 
 it is clear from ( 41 ) and ( 43 ) , the behavior of each type of the density matrix given in ( 12 ) under the spatial inversion and time reversal depends not only on the structure of the @xmath22-matrix , but also on the angular momentum of the spherical harmonics . 
 let us consider the case of an atom . 
 we treat the group @xmath122 . 
 we introduce the subgroup of @xmath123 as @xmath124 for example , @xmath125-invariant solution is given as @xmath126 there is no case for @xmath127-invariant solution . 
 @xmath128-invariant solution is given as @xmath129 @xmath5-invariant solution is given as @xmath130 due to the @xmath5 rotational invariance , each density matrix can only have an s - wave component in all cases ( 45)@xmath8(47 ) . 
 all solutions given above are the cases for closed shell states . 
 we may have magnetic qed - dmft solutions for systems under discussions , if time reversal symmetry is broken ( for example , the case of ( 47 ) ) .    under the presence of the vectorial density matrices like the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath121 , the @xmath5 rotational symmetry will be broken . 
 for @xmath131- , @xmath47- , @xmath40- and @xmath132- ( no symmetry ) invariant solutions , simple classification is impossible , because there are various possibilities of the angular momentum dependences of @xmath52 . 
 this situation demands us futher investigation in more detail in the future . 
 it must be noted that we have to solve the dirac - kohn - sham equation to find which type of the density matrices ( and solutions ) will be realized .      to consider the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits , we take the standard representation . 
 the four component bispinor @xmath2 is partitioned as  [ 36 ] @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the large component and @xmath135 is the small component . 
 then we obtain @xmath136 here , @xmath137 denotes vector - like components of @xmath121 , while @xmath138 denotes axial - vector - like components of @xmath121 . 
 therefore , at the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath135 will vanish ) , the @xmath119 and @xmath113 coincide with each other and they give @xmath139 , while the @xmath138 gives @xmath140 and the @xmath116 gives @xmath141 . 
 the @xmath115 , @xmath137 , @xmath114 and @xmath120 vanish at the nonrelativistic limit . 
 @xmath142 corresponds to the usual density of nonrelativistic theory , while @xmath143 corresponds to the spin density of nonrelativistic theory . 
 futhermore , at the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 coincide with each other ) , @xmath113 , @xmath115 , @xmath114 and @xmath116 remain while others vanish . 
 therefore , for a system under strong relativistic effects , @xmath144 and @xmath145 may give important contributions to qed - dmft solutions . 
 in this paper , we have investigated the qed - dmft and the group theoretical classification of its solutions . 
 we have introduced the one - particle local density matrix @xmath4 , and have decomposed by using @xmath22-matrices . 
 we have discussed the transformation properties of the matrix under group operations , and its nonrelativistic limit .      in the context of the electronic structure of atoms , 
 there are three effects : the electron correlation , the relativistic effect and the qed effect . 
 the electronic structure of atoms is determined by the relation of these three factors . 
 the electron correlation depends on the electron numbers and can be treated by several many - body techniques . the relativistic effect ( kinematic effect , spin - orbit , darwin , mass - velocity , etc . ) 
 becomes large with increasing the atomic number . on the other hand , 
 the case to describe the inner core electrons of heavy elements or , electrons of highly ionized heavy elements such as lithium - like uranium , the qed effect ( mainly originate in negative energy state ) can not be neglected and we must take the dirac sea into account . in the case of heavy atoms , as the ionicity becomes high and the electron number decrease , the many - body effect becomes small and the qed effect becomes large . in principle , qed - dmft can exactly estimate the three effects discussed above . 
 therefore we propose that qed - dmft should be applied to the cases where both the many - body effects and the qed effects can not be neglected . practically , we need a well - behaved exchange - correlation functional which contains both the correlation energy and qed effect satisfactorily . heavy elements in middle level of ionicity should be one of the subject for our theory . the calculation of electromagnetic properties , for example , g - factors , hyperfine interactions , nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants , are interesting . 
 the collision of two uranium atoms is also one of the interesting subject of qed - tddmft . 
 qed - tddmft should be useful to describe excitations , susceptibilities and collective modes of systems . 
 recently , experiments of x - ray irradiation to cluster plasma are performed , and verious new phenomena were studied  [ 37 ] . 
 the cluster of heavy ions under middle revel of ionicity is now an interesting subject in this area . 
 the importance of the relativistic and qed effects is discussed in such objects . 
 it is a famous fact that , the available exchange - correlation functionals only describe the dynamic correlations reliably , and they fails for systems with strong static correlations . 
 thus , usual kohn - sham scheme often breaks down in the case of near degenerate ground states . in the usual method of quantum chemistry 
 , the static correlation should be described by using multi - determinantal wavefunctions . 
 the casscf is one of the methods to take into account the static correlation effect correctly . 
 recently , the cas - dft method was proposed  [ 38 ] . in this method , 
 the dynamic correlation is considered by usual dft scheme , while static correlation is handled by cas - type wavefunction . 
 the energy functional is given as @xmath146 & = & \min_{\rho\to n}\bigl\ { f[\rho]+\int d^{3}x\rho({\bf x})v({\bf x})\bigr\ } , \\ 
 f[\rho ] & = & f^{cas}_{ks}[\rho]+e^{cas}_{c}[\rho ] , \\ 
 f^{cas}_{ks}[\rho ] & = & \min_{\psi^{cas}\to \rho}\langle\psi^{cas}|\hat{t}+\hat{v}_{ee}|\psi^{cas}\rangle ,   \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath147 are the kinetic energy and electron - electron interaction , respectively . 
 @xmath148 is a cas trial wavefunction . in the scheme given above 
 , exchange energy and static correlation energy are covered by @xmath149 , while @xmath150 includes the dynamic correlation energy only . 
 cas - dft in nonrelativistic case gives accurate results  [ 38 ] . 
 thus we propose that this method can be extended to the relativistic theory , and should become usuful tool to consider near degeneracy effect in relativistic dft framework . 
 for this aim , we introduce the density matrix which is defined as @xmath151 then we diagonalize the density matrix , we obtain the natural orbital given by four - component bispinor @xmath152 and @xmath153 as its occupation number . by using the occupation number @xmath153 , we can select the active space for treatments of the near degeneracy effects  [ 39 ] . the natural orbital analysis of a resulted solution 
 is useful to elucidate the type and magnitude of broken symmetry . 
 it is also interesting for us to use the information entropy to measure the electron correlation in various systems  [ 40 ] . 
 for example , 
 shannon entropy @xmath154 or jaynes entropy 
 @xmath155 might be useful tools . 
 the electron correlation energy can be estimated based on the collins s conjecture : @xmath156 therefore , by using these entropies , we propose to estimate the strength of the electron correlation in various atoms under various ionicities with qed - dmft .

50,"veritas is an array of four 12 m diameter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona at an elevation of 1268 m @xcite . in less than 50 hours of observations 
 , veritas can detect a source at the 1% crab flux level in the energy range from 100 gev to greater than 30 tev . 
 the array can reconstruct events with an energy resolution of @xmath115% and an angular resolution ( 68% containment ) of @xmath10.1@xmath2 . 
 for more details on the veritas instrument and techniques , see @xcite . 
 the veritas capabilities are well suited to the study and search for blazars in the northern hemisphere and will become further enhanced once a planned move of one of the telescopes is completed later this year which will yield a @xmath115% improvement in sensitivity .        a large fraction of the @xmath1750 hours of dark time ( plus an additional @xmath1250 hours of moon time ) during the veritas observing season is dedicated to observing active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . 
 the focus of these observations is two fold : one , to study known vhe agn such as mrk421 or 1es 1218 + 304 to learn about blazar emission mechanisms , black hole accretion and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and , two , to discover new types of vhe blazars which will expand the current vhe blazar catalog and perhaps reveal unknown vhe phenomenon . for more details about the veritas blazar key science program , 
 see w.  benbow s contribution in this conference@xcite .    . 
 the de - absorbed spectrum is calculated by applying the extragalactic absorption model according to franceschini , 2008@xcite.,width=240 ]    blazars are characterized by their double - humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and are further classified according to the location of the lower energy hump , usually interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons . 
 most of the @xmath125 vhe blazars detected by ground - based iact are high - frequency peaked bl lac ( hbl ) objects . 
 veritas has discovered two hbl objects , 1es 0806 + 524 and , more recently rgb j0710 + 591 . 
 in addition to these two hbl , veritas has discovered two intermediate - frequency peaked bl lac ( ibl ) objects , 3c 66a and w com . 
 this contribution describes the discovery of vhe @xmath3-rays from these four blazars . 
 there are several other contributions in this conference which will detail the veritas observations of known blazars , including multiwavelength ( mw ) observations and ebl studies ( @xcite ) . 
 the discovery @xcite of the hbl 1es 0806 + 524 was made with a combination of observations from the commissioning phase of veritas ( 30 hours ) and full array time ( 35 hours ) . 
 these observations resulted in 245 excess events corresponding to a detection at the 6.3@xmath4 level . 
 figure [ fig:0806theta2 ] shows the distribution of the squared angular distance between the shower direction and the location of 1es 0806 + 524 indicating that this source is point - like . the photon spectrum shown in figure [ fig:0806spectrum ] 
 is characterized by a power law with photon index @xmath5 between 300 and 700 gev . 
 the integral flux above 300 gev is @xmath6 corresponding to 1.8% of the crab nebula s flux . assuming absorption on the infrared component of the ebl according to franceschini , 2008 @xcite , the de - absorbed spectrum is calculated to be @xmath7 . the veritas data together with simultaneous _ 
 swift _ observations in the uv to optical to x - ray energies was used to construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object . 
 the sed is well fit by a pure synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model @xcite . for more details on the multiwavelength observations of this object 
 see j.  grube s talk in this conference @xcite . 
 veritas discovered the first ibl in vhe @xmath3-rays , w com , in a flaring state in march 2008 @xcite ( see figure [ fig : wcomskymap ] ) . 
 w com is a known @xmath3-ray source detected previously by egret in the 100 mev - 10 gev band @xcite . 
 the flare , which lasted only four days ( see figure [ fig : wcomlightcurve ] ) resulted in a detection at the 8@xmath4 level . 
 the significance of the full data set is 4.9@xmath4 . 
 70% of the total excess was from the four - day flaring period and during the two brightest nights , w comae was observed at the 9% crab flux level . using quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength data , 
 the sed can be reasonably modeled with a simple one - zone ssc but this yields an extraordinarily low magnetic field value ( b = 0.007 g ) . 
 a more natural set of fit parameters is obtained with an external - compton model indicating that the higher optical luminosity is likely providing a seed population of photons for inverse - compton scattering . 
 a second vhe flare was observed from w comae in june 2008 wherein the flux was @xmath13 times brighter than the previous flare @xcite . for more details on this second flare , 
 see g.  maier s contribution @xcite in this conference . 
 a multiwavelength campaign was triggered during this time and will be the subject of a future paper . 
 interestingly , the vhe hbl 1es 1218 + 304 can also be seen in the field - of - view ( fov ) of the w comae observations which highlights the capabilities of off - axis observations with veritas ( see figure [ fig : wcomskymap ] ) . 
 the ibl 3c 66a was discovered by veritas in 33 hours of observations resulting in a 21.2@xmath4 detection ( 1791 excess events ) @xcite . 
 variability is seen on day time scales ( see figure [ fig:3c66alightcurve ] ) during a strong flare observed in october , 2008 . the observed spectrum is well - fit by a soft power law with an index of @xmath8 . 
 the redshift of 3c 66a is uncertain . 
 it was measured to be 0.444 based on a single line @xcite and there is a lower limit of 0.096 @xcite . if the measured value of 0.444 is correct , the softness of the measured spectrum could be completely due to ebl attenuation of vhe photons ( see figure [ fig:3c66aspectrum ] ) 
 . using the model of franceschini @xcite and assuming a redshift of @xmath9 , the de - absorbed spectral index is calculated to be a very hard @xmath10 . 
 3c 66a lies only @xmath11 from the radio galaxy 3c 66b and care must be taken in identifying the source of @xmath3-rays from this region . 
 recently , the magic collaboration reported the detection of vhe gamma - rays from the region in observations carried out in 2007 and claimed marginal evidence ( at the 85% confidence level ) for association with 3c 66b @xcite . 
 however , the veritas data exclude the position of 3c 66b at the 4.3@xmath4 level ( see figure [ fig:3c66askymap ] ) . 
 in addition to this , the measured veritas spectrum does not agree with that measured by magic . 
 one explanation of the discrepancy in source localization is that 3c66b must have been considerably brighter in 2007 than 2008 , and similarly 3c 66a must have been considerably brighter in 2008 than 2007 . 
 recently the lat instrument on the fermi satellite also observed bright emission in the mev - gev range at a level higher than that reported by egret . 
 in addition , observations of the blazar were made by the _ 
 swift _ and _ chandra _ satellites . 
 details of these multiwavelength observations will be the subject of a future paper and are highlighted in l.  reyes contribution @xcite . 
 rgb j0710 + 591 was only recently discovered to emit vhe emission and is the fourth veritas blazar discovery @xcite . 
 located at a redshift of 0.125 , veritas observed rgb j0710 for @xmath12 hours resulting in a @xmath13 detection from 140 @xmath3-rays corresponding to @xmath14 of the crab nebula s flux . 
 a future publication will describe the veritas observations as well as multiwavelength observations from the _ swift _ , _ chandra _ and fermi satellites . 
 a preliminary skymap is shown in figure [ fig : rgbj0710skymap ] . 
 the preliminary observed spectrum can be described as a power law with photon index @xmath15 . while not as hard as 1es 0229 + 200 which placed the strongest constraints to date on the density of the ebl in the mind - infrared band , the moderately high distance and relatively hard spectrum of rgb j0710 + 591 confirms the constraints presented in @xcite .

 the dashed circle is the integration region.,width=240 ]    [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ] 
 to date , veritas has detected more than a dozen blazars and has discovered vhe emission from four blazars : 1es 0806 + 524 , rgb j0710 + 591 w com and 3c 66a ( see table [ tab : blazars ] ) . 
 the first two of these are hbl objects while the latter two are ibl objects . 
 the discovery of 1es 0806 + 524 highlights the capabilities of veritas to detect low - flux objects while the detection of the two ibl objects opens a new window into the study of blazar populations in the vhe regime . 
 additionally , the detection of 1es 1218 + 304 in the fov of w com provides an example of the ability to detect objects at the edge of veritas fov . 
 future studies of the moderately distant rgb j0710 + 591 might provide interesting constrains on the ebl .

51,"the development of more powerful computing platforms as well as improvements in algorithms suggest that unquenched lattice qcd gauge configurations on reasonably large lattices should become available in the not too distant future . 
 the generation of equilibrated and decorrelated dynamical gauge configurations for lighter quark masses will nevertheless remain extremely costly in computational terms , and elementary considerations of load - balancing suggest that we should be willing to expend a correspondingly large computational effort in extracting the maximum physical content from each available gauge configuration . 
 hadronic correlators built from conventional quark propagators ( which give the quark propagation amplitude from a single source to all points on the lattice , for example ) evidently exploit only a fraction of the physical information latent in each gauge configuration . in this paper 
 we explore the statistical properties and computational feasibility of an alternative stochastic approach to generating quark propagators , one which supplies simultaneously quark propagation amplitudes from any point on a space - time lattice to any other ( i.e. all - point propagators ) . 
 the use of pseudofermion fields has been studied previously @xcite ; particularly for single light quark systems ( e.g. heavy - light mesons ) . with these approaches , 
 as the quark mass becomes light the convergence of pseudofermion monte carlo calculation suffers critical slowing down . in this paper 
 , we observe that for physical correlators ( in momentum space ) the statistical noise problem resides mainly in its low momentum behaviour . 
 we will find that the convergence can be greatly improved by separating off the lowest eigenmodes of the dirac operator and treating them exactly while doing the monte carlo calculations with a mode - shifted action . 
 in section 2 we review the essential properties of pseudofermion fields which allow the computation of an all - point propagator . 
 although the detailed results presented in this paper primarily concern wilson or clover - improved quark actions , we also indicate here how the method can be applied to the computation of an all - point overlap operator . of course 
 , the basic properties of pseudofermion fields will already be familiar to practitioners of the hybrid montecarlo @xcite or the luescher multiboson method @xcite . in section 3 
 we describe in some detail the use of pseudofermion quark propagators in constructing a variety of hadronic correlators ( corresponding to both two- and three - point hadronic greens functions ) , such as disconnected parts contributing to form factors or to hairpin amplitudes for isoscalar mesons , etc . in section 4 
 we describe the statistical properties of hadronic correlators computed using pseudofermion all point propagators . 
 the availability of all - point propagators allows high - statistics evaluations of the full four - momentum structure of such correlators . 
 detailed autocorrelation studies reveal that the method gives very accurate results ( with rapidly decorrelating amplitudes with a time constant of a few heat - bath sweeps of the pseudofermion fields ) for all but the lowest lattice momenta . 
 the critical slowing down in these modes is related to the presence of low eigenmodes of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator . 
 projection and shifting of a few low - lying modes turns out to be computationally straightforward , and finally in section 5 we show that such mode - shifted pseudofermion simulations allow accurate extraction of _ all _ momentum components of hadronic correlators . 
 a pseudofermion action suitable for computing all - point quark propagators is constructed from the quadratic form @xmath2 defining the basic quark action of the theory : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are spin - color indices and @xmath5 lattice sites . for the time - being , we shall consider wilson or clover - improved actions only ( later , we return to the case of ginsparg - wilson @xcite compliant overlap actions ) 
 . then the operator @xmath6 is hermitian and 
 we can form a positive - definite bosonic (  pseudofermion "" ) action as follows @xmath7 in terms of a complex bosonic pseudofermion field @xmath8 . averages of products of the pseudofermion field with respect to the gaussian weight defined in eq([eq : pfact ] ) yield inverses of @xmath9 in the usual way : @xmath10 note that the gaussian dependence of the pseudofermion action implies @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lattice volume ( = number of lattice sites ) . 
 this exact result is extremely useful in checking for errors in the simulation algorithm and in determining equilibration of an ensemble . 
 of course , the quark propagator of interest in lattice qcd simulations is ( up to a trivial @xmath13 factor ) @xmath14 , not @xmath15 . 
 this can easily be achieved by a single additional 
 dslash "" operation applied to the conjugate pseudofermion field : @xmath16 note that separate pseudofermion fields are needed for each quark propagator as averages of products of ( say ) four _ bosonic _ pseudofermion fields will produce contractions with the wrong sign relative to the corresponding fermionic 4 quark amplitudes . 
 the simulation of averages of the kind found in ( [ eq : pfsim],[eq : avgact],[eq : qprop ] ) can be readily accomplished by heat - bath updates , due to the simple gaussian dependence of the action on the fields . for either wilson or clover - improved actions , 
 the dependence of the pseudofermion weight on the pseudofermion field at a specific lattice site @xmath17 takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a complex spin - color vector assembled from the pseudofermion field at nearest and next - to - nearest sites , as well as appropriate gauge - link variables connecting to those sites . 
 the 12x12 matrix @xmath20 is a multiple of the identity ( specifically @xmath21 ) for wilson actions , and a more complicated hermitian matrix assembled from clover gauge fields in the sw - improved case . in either case , the heat - bath update of @xmath22 is readily managed by completing the square in ( [ eq : locweight ] ) . for the clover actions , 
 the matrices @xmath23 can be prediagonalized just once at the start of the simulation , and the resulting stored eigenvalues and eigenvectors used to quickly generate @xmath8 updates at each site according to the weight ( [ eq : locweight ] ) . 
 the pseudofermion method can be readily generalized to study the all - point overlap operator arising from an overlap action satisfying the ginsparg - wilson condition @xcite . 
 let @xmath24 be the hermitian wilson - dirac operator with suitably chosen overlap mass . 
 the all - point overlap operator for arbitrary bare quark mass is trivially computable once all matrix elements of the nonlocal operator @xmath25 are obtained . using an optimal rational approximation @xcite , 
 this nonlocal operator can be written @xmath26 where @xmath27 are real and the @xmath28 are real positive . 
 the number of pole terms @xmath29 needed for a given level of uniform accuracy over the spectrum of @xmath24 is related in a fairly straightforward way to the condition number of @xmath24 , but typical studies of the overlap operator have used @xmath30 . 
 we shall return to this issue in section 4 , where we show that mode - shifting can be used to dramatically improve this condition number and reduce the number of poles needed . 
 the needed all - point operator can clearly be obtained by an average of @xmath29 pseudofermion fields , @xmath31 : we begin from the positive definite action @xmath32 and construct the desired combination of pole terms from a corresponding combination of pseudofermion fields , averaged relative to the weight ( [ eq : pfovlp ] ) : @xmath33 the computation of all - point overlap propagators will require a simulation within a simulation ( analogously to the situation for single source overlap propagators , where inversions within an outer conjugate gradient inversion are required , @xcite ) . 
 in general , the computation of multipoint hadronic correlators involving @xmath34 quark propagators can be reduced to convolutions of @xmath34 pseudofermion fields , rapidly computed by fast fourier transform ( fft ) . 
 in fact , using fft we can easily construct a wide range of correlators involving both local and smeared operators . in this section 
 we shall illustrate this by considering a number of examples of physical interest . 
 we note here that it may be advisable to combine all - point with conventional fixed source ( or sink ) propagators ( obtained , say , from a conjugate gradient inversion ) , as accurate results become increasingly difficult as the number of allpoint propagators used increases , due to the large condition number of @xmath24 , as will become clear in subsequent sections . 
 furthermore , the projection methods described in section 5 become increasingly essential in reducing the statistical errors of the pseudofermion average as the number of independent all - point propagators increase . 
 the all - point propagators obtained by the pseudofermion technique can be used to construct the complete momentum - space dependence of 2-point correlators of scalar or pseudoscalar densities , or vector or axial - vector currents , while exploiting the full physical content of each gauge configuration . 
 for example , we may be interested in the full 4-momentum transform @xmath35 of the 2-point pseudoscalar correlator @xmath36 , given by @xmath37 where ( 10 ) represents a conventional operator vev , the single brackets in ( 11 ) refer to a functional average over gauge - fields , and the double brackets in ( 12 ) imply averages over gauge configurations as well as a pseudofermion average for each gauge configuration to determine the all - point propagators @xmath38 in ( 11 ) . 
 the full momentum - space correlator thus becomes an easily evaluated fast fourier transform of products of pseudofermion fields : @xmath39    at this point , it may be of use to the reader to indicate the computational requirementsof these pseudofermion simulations ( see @xcite for more details ) . for a 6@xmath40 lattice , a single heat - bath update of the two pseudofermion fields 
 @xmath41 requires 0.366 sec . on a 1.5 ghz pentium-4 processor . 
 the convolutions and fft operations required to obtain the desired four - momentum field @xmath42 in ( [ eq : fft2point ] ) require an additional 0.024 sec . and are performed after every 2 heat - bath updates of @xmath41 . 
 typically , a sufficiently accurate pseudofermion average for @xmath42 was obtained from 20000 measurements , corresponding to 2.1 pentium-4 hrs . for 10@xmath43x20 lattices , 
 a heat - bath update costs 3.30 sec , a measurement of @xmath44 requires 0.43 sec . 
 ( again , performed every 2 heat - bath steps ) , and final averages are taken from 7000 measurements , corresponding to 6.8 pentium-4 hrs . for comparison , the evaluation of a conventional conjugate - gradient single - source propagator on a 10@xmath43x20 lattice requires 1.2 pentium-4 hrs .      in lattice 
 qcd , hadron spectroscopy is usually studied using smeared hadron sources / sinks to optimize the ground - state signal in each hadronic channel 
 . a typical multistate propagation amplitude from euclidean time @xmath45 to @xmath46 might therefore involve evaluation of the matrix @xmath47 where @xmath48 are a set of spatial smearing wavefunctions , @xmath49 denotes the quark field at spatial ( lattice ) point @xmath50 and time @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the appropriate spin matrices for the desired hadronic channels . 
 the sums over @xmath53 project the physical states onto zero - momentum . of course 
 , delta function choices for @xmath54 allow us to use local sources or sinks . 
 in terms of pseudofermion quark propagators @xmath55 where the second line of ( [ eq : multipf ] ) ( @xmath56=number of flavors ) is present only for isoscalar amplitudes where there is a nonvanishing loop - back (  hairpin "" ) amplitude . the four - fold spatial sum in ( [ eq : multipf ] ) can fortunately be reduced to operations linear in the spatial volume @xmath57 of the lattice via the magic of fourier transforms . 
 define smeared pseudofermion fields @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fourier transform smearing function and @xmath60 represents the spatially fourier transformed ( and time - sliced ) pseudofermion field . 
 taking the isovector amplitude part of ( [ eq : multipf ] ) for simplicity , one finds that this reduces to @xmath61 the isoscalar contribution , if present , is trivially obtained by interchanging the pseudofermion fields in an obvious way . 
 the computation of more complicated correlators , such as the 3-point functions needed to extract form factors , is greatly facilitated if we have all - point quark propagators at our disposal . 
 a typical example is shown in fig.1 , where a smeared meson created at time @xmath62 propagates to time @xmath63 , where spacelike momentum @xmath64 is injected at spacetime point @xmath65 by an electromagnetic current , followed by propagation of the final - state meson to time @xmath66 , when it is removed by an appropriate smeared - sink operator .    the quark diagram displayed in fig . 
 1 represents the connected contribution to the following hadronic correlator : @xmath67 where in this case the same smearing function @xmath68 ( optimized for a pion , say ) is applied at both initial and final times . 
 the complete momentum - dependence of this 3-point function can be obtained by using an all - point pseudofermion propagator for the quark propagator from @xmath65 to @xmath69 . 
 the quark propagators into the point sink at @xmath70 and from the smeared source point at @xmath71 can be computed by conventional conjugate - gradient techniques . again , by using fourier transforms appropriately , the calculation of @xmath72 can be reduced to operations at most linear in the spatial lattice volume . finally , as for the case of smeared meson propagators discussed above 
 , the disconnected contribution involving the contraction of @xmath73 back to @xmath74 can be calculated with no extra effort , as the all - point propagator for just this case has been computed . in this case 
 the pseudofermion field will appear in an average of the form @xmath75 . 
 in this section we shall describe the results of detailed studies of the statistical properties of pseudofermion propagators computed from the basic formulas ( 3 ) . 
 we first consider a case where only one all - point propagator is used in assembling the full hadronic amplitude- namely , the 3-point correlator @xmath76 giving the pion formfactor discussed in section 3.3 . 
 we shall see shortly that as a consequence of the typically high condition number of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath24 , autocorrelations for low - momentum amplitudes become progressively longer as more all - point propagators are introduced into the calculation ( in section 5 , we shall show how to fix this problem by mode - shifting ) . here , we begin with an application where autocorrelations are relatively unproblematic .    for the pion form - factor calculation , we generated quenched configurations at @xmath775.9 on 12@xmath43x24 lattices , and studied the resulting quark propagators at @xmath780.1590 ( with the wilson action ) . 
 the results described here were obtained by studying the simulation of the quantity @xmath76 for a randomly chosen gauge configuration from this ensemble : examination of other configurations reveals that the behavior we describe is generic . from eq(4 ) the ( infinite ensemble ) average pseudofermion action should therefore be @xmath79497664 . from fig.2 
 it is apparent that the equilibrium value for this quantity is reached rather quickly , after about 20 heat - bath sweeps through the lattice . 
 an average of the value of 200 consecutive pseudofermion configurations after this gives for example @xmath79497599 with a standard deviation of @xmath80650 . 
 typically , we have performed measurements using pseudofermion fields after 100 initial sweeps . 
 the decorrelation of hadronic amplitudes in the course of a montecarlo simulation of the pseudofermion propagator ( [ eq : pfsim ] ) is extremely sensitive to the particular momentum component being calculated . in particular , low momentum components have a large overlap with the smallest eigenmodes of @xmath24 , which can have very small eigenvalues ( @xmath8010@xmath81 is not uncommon ) . these low modes decorrelate only slowly in any local update of the action ( 2 ) . 
 this property becomes immediately apparent when we examine the momentum dependence of either the convergence of cumulative averages ( fig.3 ) of @xmath82 ( taking @xmath83=3 ) or the autocorrelation function of the same quantity ( fig.4 ) , as a function of number of pseudofermion heat - bath sweeps performed . 
 the autocorrelation time ( defined as the integral under the autocorrelation curve of fig . 
 4 ) turns out to be about 13 for the zero - momentum mode and 7 for the @xmath841 ( lattice units ) mode : higher momenta ( not shown here ) yield autocorrelation times of order unity . 
 in fact , the autocorrelation times for this correlator are fairly mild in comparison to the cases involving two all - point propagators discussed below : 8000 pseudofermion sweeps (= @xmath80 12 hrs on a 1.5ghz pentium 4 ) allow @xmath76 to be extracted with error bars well below the intrinsic fluctuation of the correlator from one gauge configuration to the next ( see fig.5 ) . 
 the critical slowing down seen in low eigenmodes becomes a more serious problem in situations where two separate all - point propagators are required to construct the desired correlator , as in the local two - point correlators discussed in section 3.1 . in this case 
 the very large condition number of @xmath9 implies an _ extremely _ slow convergence for the zero - momentum component of the correlator . 
 for example , from ( 11 ) we see that the local pseudoscalar density correlator can be written , in momentum space @xmath85 which becomes , for zero momentum @xmath86 as one not uncommonly encounters small eigenvalues of @xmath24 , it is apparent that a few low eigenmodes can contribute disproportionately to this quantity 
 . moreover , these are exactly the modes that decorrelate most slowly in the pseudofermion simulation . to illustrate this , we have studied @xcite hadronic 2-point correlators on an ensemble of unquenched configurations generated with the truncated determinant algorithm ( tda,@xcite ) on physically large coarse 6@xmath40 lattices ( lattice spacing @xmath800.4 fm ) . 
 cumulative averages for @xmath42 for a range of values of @xmath87 , for a typical gauge configuration in this ensemble , are shown in fig . 
 the zero momentum mode is clearly not convergent even after 8000 pseudofermion sweeps , while even the smallest nonzero ( lattice ) momentum component shows much more rapid convergence . for the particular gauge configuration illustrated here , 
 the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath24 turns out to be 0.0024 , which contributes 54% of the total zero - momentum value @xmath88 ! the problem for this lowest mode can be seen ( fig . 
 6 ) in another guise in the autocorrelation curves for @xmath89 ( the autocorrelation time is @xmath80 1 pseudofermion sweep for @xmath90 ( lattice units ) so these curves are not shown ) . 
 fortunately , the critical slowing down experienced in these pseudofermion simulations of all - point propagators appears only to infect the very lowest momentum components . 
 we shall see in the next section that the problem can be eliminated for these components by mode - shifting a relatively small number of low eigenmodes of @xmath24 . 
 this preconditioning substantially reduces autocorrelation times and allows us to extract reasonably accurate values even for the zero - momentum component of hadronic correlators . 
 the extraction and separate treatment of low eigenmodes is also essential in calculating accurate all - point overlap operators . 
 the slow convergence of the lowest momentum modes discussed in the preceding section can be substantially accelerated by shifting the low eigenmodes of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath24 responsible for the critical slowing down . in the case of the two - point correlator ( [ eq : dpsps ] ) , 
 the relevant parameter is the condition number of @xmath9 , which ( for the ensemble of unquenched 6@xmath40 lattices discussed in section 4 ) can typically be reduced by two orders of magnitude by shifting the lowest 10 eigenmodes of @xmath9 . 
 more generally , define @xmath91 where @xmath92 are a complete orthonormal set of eigenmodes of @xmath24 , @xmath93 , and the lowest @xmath29 modes ( in absolute value ) are shifted : @xmath94 for simplicity we shall take @xmath95 henceforth , although any value with magnitude of order unity will do . the extraction of low eigenmodes of @xmath24 is computationally straightforward using implicitly restarted arnoldi techniques @xcite : each mode requires a few minutes on a pentium-4 processor for the 6@xmath40 lattices discussed here . 
 corresponding to the shifted operator @xmath96 defined in ( [ eq : shifth ] ) is a shifted pseudofermion action : @xmath97 once the relevant low eigenmodes @xmath98 are known , the heat - bath update of the pseudofermion field @xmath8 can be performed by trivial modifications of the procedure outlined in section 2 . the added computational load is not large : if @xmath29=10 modes are shifted , the time required for a pseudofermion update increases by about 20% . for the rest of this section , we shall use the double - bracket notation @xmath99 introduced in section 2 to indicate averages relative to the weight generated by the shifted action @xmath100 . 
 accordingly , the _ unshifted _ quark propagator is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and the tilde notation on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : propform ] ) still refers to the unshifted operator @xmath24 , as in ( [ eq : qprop ] ) . 
 the pseudoscalar correlator in ( 10 - 12 ) can therefore be written @xmath103 the term involving a double sum @xmath104 over shifted modes in ( [ eq : finaldpsps ] ) does not involve pseudofermion fields and is therefore calculated just once . 
 we see that the usual result ( 12 ) has to be supplemented by an average of overlaps of the two pseudofermion fields with the shifted eigenmodes . again 
 , this is computationally perfectly manageable . 
 the dramatic effect of shifting even a few low eigenmodes on the convergence of correlators built from pseudofermion averages is illustrated in figs . 
 as expected , the worst behavior is found in the zero momentum mode , where the unshifted averages ( fig . 
 7 ) are still 60% below the correct answer after 50,000 pseudofermion sweeps , while only 10,000 sweeps already give a reasonably good result after the 10 lowest modes are shifted . 
 the autocorrelation curves for the zero - momentum component tell the same story ( fig . 
 8) : the autocorrelation time is about 140 sweeps for the unshifted simulation , dropping to 11 ( 5 ) sweeps after shifting 10 ( resp . 
 20 ) modes . 
 the overall situation is much better for the lowest non - zero momentum mode , @xmath105 , as shown in figs . 
 9,10 . here 
 the autocorrelation times are roughly 8,3,2 sweeps for simulations with 0,10 and 20 shifted modes respectively , and the cumulative averages reflect a correspondingly higher stability . 
 the numerical evidence from these simulations clearly suggests that mode - shifting with @xmath29=10 modes , for the ensemble of 6@xmath40 tda lattices considered here , is perfectly adequate for obtaining accurate results at all momenta .    the calculation of an all - point overlap operator using ( [ eq : optrat ] ) 
 can be greatly facilitated by mode - shifting . 
 the number @xmath29 of poles needed in the optimal rational approximation to achieve a desired uniform accuracy for @xmath106 over the full spectrum of @xmath24 is directly related to the condition number ( ratio of highest to lowest eigenvalues ) of @xmath24 . on the other hand , provided the mode shifting preserves the algebraic sign of the shifted eigenvalues ( sign(@xmath107)=sign(@xmath108 ) ) , one clearly has @xmath109 . 
 accordingly , the condition number of @xmath24 can be drastically reduced by computing the overlap pseudofermion operator using ( [ eq : pfovlp ] ) with @xmath24 replaced with @xmath96 as the pseudofermion action : the required code is identical to that used in the mode - shifted calculations of conventional wilson propagators described above .

52,"one the most important and intriguing open questions in the physics of compact objects is the issue of the final stage of black hole evolution and the problem of singularities residing in the internal region of the black holes . although the definitive answer to these questions would require the application of the full machinery of the ( unknown as yet ) quantum gravity or even more sophisticated approach , one can still obtain valuable results within the semiclassical framework 
 of course , the equations of the semiclassical gravity can not be used to describe the evolution of the system completely : such equations are expected to break down in the planck regime . on the other hand , however , having established the domain of applicability of the theory precisely one can obtain interesting and important results . moreover , a careful analysis of the solutions to the semiclassical equations can show us tendencies in the evolution of the system , indicating its possible continuation .    it is well known that the physical content of quantum field theory in spacetimes describing black holes is carried by the renormalized stress - energy tensor ( set ) evaluated in a suitable state  @xcite . treating the renormalized stress - energy tensor as the source term of the semiclassical einstein field equations , one can , in principle , determine the back reaction of the quantized fields upon the spacetime geometry of black holes unless the ( expected ) quantum gravity effects become dominant . 
 therefore , form the point of view of the semiclassical approach , it is crucial to have at one s disposal a general formula describing functional dependence of the renormalized stress - energy tensor on a wide class of metrics .    in the semi - classical approach 
 we are confronted with two major problems : construction of the renormalized stress - energy tensor on the one hand , and studying its influence via semi - classical equations on the system on the other . 
 unfortunately , even such a simplified approach leads to the equations that are still far too complicated to be solved exactly and it is natural that much effort has been concentrated on developing approximate methods , referring to numerical calculations or both . 
 it seems that for the massive fields , the approximation based on the schwinger - dewitt expansion  @xcite is of required generality . 
 indeed , it has been shown that for sufficiently massive fields , the renormalized effective action , @xmath0 , can be expanded in powers of @xmath1 it is because the nonlocal contribution to the total effective action can be neglected , and , consequently , there remains only the vacuum polarization part which is local and determined by the geometry of the spacetime . 
 the stress - energy tensor can , therefore , be obtained by functional differentiation of the effective action with respect to the metric tensor : @xmath2 such a tensor describing the vacuum polarization effects of the quantized massive fields in the vacuum type - d geometries has been constructed and subsequently applied in a series of papers by frolov and zelnikov  @xcite . 
 they used the schwinger - dewitt method  @xcite and constructed the first order approximation of the effective action , omitting the terms which do not contribute to the final results in the ricci - flat spaces . 
 these results have subsequently been extended in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the most general formulas describing the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar , spinor and vector fields have been calculated . 
 as the effective action consists of 10 ( integrated ) purely geometric terms constructed from the curvature tensor and multiplied by the spin - dependent coefficients , it suffices to calculate their functional derivatives with respect to metric tensor only once . 
 the stress - energy tensor of the scalar , spinor and vector fields can easily be obtained by taking the linear combination of the thus obtained functional derivatives with the spin - dependent coefficients . 
 interested reader is referred to  @xcite and  @xcite . 
 ( especially see eqs . 
 7 - 18 and table i of ref  @xcite ) . 
 the range of applicability of such a stress - energy tensor is dictated by the limitations of the validity of the renormalized effective action : it can be used in any spacetime provided the mass of the quantized field is sufficiently great , i.e. , when the compton length , @xmath3 is much smaller than the characteristic radius of curvature , @xmath4 where the latter means any characteristic length scale associated with the geometry in question . 
 assuming , for example , that @xmath5 is related to the kretschmann scalar as @xmath6 one has a simple criterion for the validity of the schwinger - dewitt expansion . 
 typically , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the black hole mass , and , therefore , one expects that the approximation would be accurate provided @xmath9 and @xmath5 satisfy @xmath10    using a different method , anderson , hiscock , and samuel @xcite evaluated @xmath11 of the massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling for a general static , spherically symmetric spacetime and applied the obtained formulas to the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) spacetime . 
 ( see also ref . 
 their approximation is equivalent to the schwinger - dewitt expansion ; to obtain the lowest ( i. e. @xmath12 ) terms , one has to use sixth - order wkb expansion of the mode functions . 
 numerical calculations reported in ref . 
 @xcite indicate that the schwinger - dewitt method always provide a good approximation of the renormalized stress energy tensor of the massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling as long as the mass of the field remains sufficiently large . 
 the techniques presented in refs . 
 @xcite have been successfully applied in a number of cases . specifically , the vacuum polarization in the electrically charged black holes have been studied in refs . 
 @xcite , important issue of the black hole interiors in @xcite , the stress - energy tensor in the spacetimes of various wormhole types in  @xcite and the back reaction calculations in  @xcite .    on the other hand , the general formulas of refs . 
 @xcite have been applied in the spactimes of the reissner - nordstrm  @xcite and dilaton black holes  @xcite . 
 various aspects of the back reaction problem have been studied in refs . 
 especially interesting in this regard are the regular black hole geometries , being the solutions of the coupled system of equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics and gravitation . 
 the stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar fields ( with an arbitrary curvature coupling ) in such spaces have been studied in  @xcite . 
 the issue of the regular black holes in general relativity has a long and interesting history . 
 for example , one of the methods that can be used in construction of such configurations consits in replacing the singular black hole interior by a regular core . 
 this idea appeared in mid sixties  @xcite and its various realizations have been and still are investigated . 
 for example , in the models considered in refs . 
 @xcite part of the region inside the event horizon is joined through a thin boundary layer to de sitter geometry . 
 similar idea has been applied in the calculations reported in ref . 
 @xcite , where the singular interior of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole has been replaced by the bertotti - robinson geometry . 
 of course , such a geometric surgery does not exhaust all interesting possibilities . 
 the regular geometries constructed with the aid of suitably chosen profile functions , or , better , the exact solutions constructed for specific , physically reasonable sources are of equal importance  @xcite . 
 recent interest in the nonlinear electrodynamics is partially motivated ( beside a natural curiosity ) by the fact that the theories of this type frequently arise in modern theoretical physics . 
 for example , they appear as effective theories of string / m - theory . 
 moreover , on general grounds one expects that it should be possible to construct the regular black hole solutions to the coupled system of equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity . 
 one of the most interesting and intriguing regular solutions has been constructed by ayn - beato and garca @xcite . 
 it has subsequently been reinterpreted by bronnikov in refs . 
 the former solution describes a regular static and spherically symmetric configuration parametrized by the mass and the electric charge whereas the latter describes a formally similar geometry characterized by @xmath13 and the magnetic charge @xmath14 . 
 we shall refer to the solutions of this kind as abgb geometries . 
 it should be noted that the electric solution does not contradict the no - go theorem , which states that if the lagrangian of the matter fields , @xmath15 is an arbitrary function of @xmath16 with the maxwell asymptotics in a weak field limit ( @xmath17 is the electromagnetic tensor ) , then it can not have a regular center . 
 this is because the formulation of the nonlinear electrodynamics employed by ayn - beato and garca ( @xmath18 framework in the nomenclature of refs . 
 @xcite ) is not the one to which one refers in the assumptions of the theorem . 
 specifically , the solution of ayn - beato and garca has been constructed in a formulation of the nonlinear electrodynamics obtained from the original one ( @xmath19 framework ) by means of a legendre transformation ( see ref . 
 @xcite for details ) .    for certain values of the parameters the abgb line element describes a black hole and 
 an attractive feature of this solutions that simplifies calculations is the possibility to express the location of the horizons in terms of the lambert special functions @xcite . 
 moreover , as the function @xmath20 coincides with the lagrangian density of the maxwell theory in the weak field limit , one expects that at large distances the static and spherically symmetric solution should approach the reissner - nordstrm solution . 
 a similar behavior should occur outside the event horizon for @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes either the electric or magnetic charge and @xmath13 is the mass . 
 the objective of this paper is to construct the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized neutral massive spinor and vector fields in the spacetime of the regular abgb black hole . 
 the stress - energy tensor of the scalar fields with arbitrary curvature coupling has been constructed and discussed in refs . 
 the results presented here are the basic ingredients of the first - order back reaction calculations . 
 they can also be used in the analysis of the various energy conditions and quantum inequalities . 
 the source term of the semi - classical einstein field equations is given by the stress - energy tensor . 
 ideally , such a tensor should be constructed from the renormalized effective action , @xmath23 in a standard way , i.e. , by functional differentiation of @xmath23 with respect to the metric . unfortunately , neither the exact nor the approximate form of @xmath24 is known in general . however , in a large mass limit of the quantized fields one can construct its local approximation satisfactorily describing the vacuum polarization effects . 
 the massive scalar , spinor and vector fields in curved spacetime satisfy the differential equations @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath28 is the curvature coupling constant , and @xmath29 are the dirac matrices obeying standard relations @xmath30 the lowest - order approximation of the renormalized effective action , @xmath31 of the quantized massive fields satisfying equations ( [ s0]-[s1 ] ) is given by a remarkably simple expression @xmath32 \\ 
 -tr[a_{3}^{(1/2 ) } ] \\   tr[a_{3}^{(1)}]\,-\,[a_{3|\xi = 0}^{(0 ) } ] \end{array } \right .    \label{weff}\ ] ] here @xmath33 $ ] is the coincidence limit of the fourth hadamard - dewitt - minakshisundaram - seeley  @xcite coefficient of the scalars ( @xmath34 spinors ( @xmath35 ) and vectors ( @xmath36 . 
 making use of elementary properties of the dirac matrices and the riemann tensor , after simple calculations , one obtains the first term of the asymptotic expansion of the effective action in the form @xcite @xmath37 where the numerical coefficients @xmath38 depending on the spin of the field are given in a table i.    up to now , we have not specified the quantum state of the field . 
 however , the construction of the effective action has been carried out with the assumption that the state in question may be identified with the hartle - hawking state . a closer examination of the problem indicates that outside the narrow strip in the closest vicinity of the event horizon , the results obtained in the hartle - hawking as well as the unruh and the boulware states are almost indistinguishable as they differ by the contributions of the real particles . on the other hand , inside that region the stress - energy tensor strongly depends on the chosen state and may diverge at the event horizon . 
 on general grounds , one expects that for regular geometries the schwinger - dewitt approximation yields a regular stress - energy tensor at the event horizon . 
 it should be stressed that although the effective action @xmath39 can , in principle , be calculated for any line element , its physical applications are limited to the quantized fields in the large mass limit . 
 moreover , the technical difficulties one may encounter in the process of calculation may prevent direct application of the effective action and the stress - energy tensor . 
 finally , observe that the effective action approach employed in this paper requires the metric of the spacetime to be positively defined . 
 hence , to obtain the physical stress - energy tensor one has to analitically continue the results constructed for the euclidean metric .    .the 
 coefficients @xmath40 for the massive scalar , spinor , and vector field [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ] 
 an interesting solution to the coupled system of nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity representing a class of the black holes parametrized by a mass and a charge has been constructed recently by ayn - beato and garca  @xcite and by bronnikov @xcite . 
 the former describes electrically charged configuration in the @xmath18-framework whereas the latter describes geometry of the magnetically charged solution in the @xmath19-framework . 
 both line elements are formally identical and can be written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 ,   \label{gg}\ ] ] @xmath8 is the black hole mass and @xmath22 is either the magnetic or the electric charge . for small values of the charge 
 it differs outside the event horizon from the reissner - nordstrm solution by terms of order @xmath43 similarly , at large distances the the function @xmath44 also closely resembles that of the rn solution . indeed , expanding metric potentials in a power series one 
 concludes that the abgb solution behaves asymptotically as @xmath45    on the other hand , and this is even more interesting and has profound consequences , the interior of the abgb solution is regular . 
 this can be demonstrated by studying behavior of various curvature invariants . 
 it can be shown that curvature invariants factorize in such a way that there is a common multiplicative factor , which for @xmath46 behaves asymptotically as @xmath47 for @xmath48 the abgb solution reduces to the schwarzschild line element and it is the nonlinear charge , no matter how small , that leads to the dramatic changes of the geometry . 
 the spacetime described by the line element ( [ line_abg ] ) with ( [ gg ] ) has been extensively studied in  @xcite . 
 specifically , it has been shown that although the metric coefficient @xmath44 is a complicated function of @xmath49 , the location of the horizons may be elegantly expressed in terms of the lambert functions @xcite . 
 since these results are , apparently , not widely known we shall summarize a few basic facts . for a short description of the lambert functions the reader is referred to  @xcite . 
 making use of the substitution @xmath50 and @xmath51 and subsequently introducing a new unknown function @xmath52 by means of the relation @xmath53 one arrives at @xmath54 since the lambert function is defined as @xmath55 one concludes that the location of the horizons as a function of @xmath56 is given by the real branches of the lambert functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the only real branches of the lambert function with the branch point at @xmath61 where e is the base of natural logarithms 
 . finally , observe , that simple manipulations of eqs . 
 ( [ eh ] ) and ( [ ih ] ) indicate that for @xmath62 the horizons @xmath63 and @xmath64 merge at @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a principal branch of the lambert function @xmath68    inspection of ( [ qextr ] ) reveals another interesting feature of the abgb geometries : the black hole solution exists for @xmath69 greater than the analogous ratio of the parameters of the rn solution . 
 the three types of the abgb solutions therefore are : the regular black hole with the inner and event horizons for @xmath70 the extremal black hole for @xmath71 and the regular configuration for @xmath72 as have been observed earlier at large distances as well as for small charges the geometry of the abgb solution resembles that of the reissner - nordstrm . 
 there is , however , one notable distinction : for @xmath73 the reissner - nordstrm solution describes unphysical naked singularity whereas the regular geometry for @xmath74 could be interpreted as a particle like solution . 
 the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar ( with an arbitrary curvature coupling ) , spinor and vector fields in a large mass limit has a general form @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be obtained from eq . 
 ( [ eff_act_2 ] ) and the spin dependent coefficients are listed in table i. the purely geometric objects @xmath77 have been calculated in refs . 
 it has been shown that the thus obtained renormalized stress - energy tensor consists of approximately 100 terms ( constructed from the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives and contractions ) combined with the numerical coefficients depending on the spin of the quantized field . 
 however , such a local geometric structure of the stress - energy tensor has its price : @xmath78 does not describe the process of particle creation which is a nonlocal phenomenon . 
 fortunately , for sufficiently massive fields , the contribution of the real particles can be neglected and the schwinger - dewitt action satisfactorily approximates the total effective action . 
 the general expression describing the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized fields in a large mass limit is rather complicated and to avoid unnecessary proliferation of lengthy formulas it will be not presented here . for its full form as well as the technical details the interested reader 
 is referred to @xcite ( especially see eqs.7 - 18 ) and  @xcite . because of numerous identities that hold for the riemann tensor , the final form of the stress - energy tensor is not unique and obviously depends on adapted simplification strategies 
 . it should be noted , however , that any other calculation based on the effective action ( [ eff_act_2 ] ) with the numerical coefficients @xmath79 for scalar , spinor and vector field must yield results identical to those of refs . 
 recently , an equivalent form of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive fields has been constructed by folacci and decanini  @xcite .    as has been stated earlier , the general formulas of refs . 
 @xcite have been successfully applied in a number cases , such as reissner - nordstrm spacetime  @xcite , dilatonic black holes  @xcite , and various back reaction calculations  @xcite . moreover , 
 the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar field with the arbitrary curvature coupling in the abgb geometry has been calculated and exhaustively discussed in refs . 
 @xcite . in this section 
 we shall extend these calculations to the massive spinor and vector fields . 
 since the general form of the stress - energy tensor is rather complicated , one expects that its components evaluated for the specific line element are , except simple geometries , formidable . 
 our calculations in the abgb background clearly shows that this is indeed the case , and once again , to avoid unnecessary proliferation of long formulas we shall not display them here . on the other hand , one can obtain a great deal of information studying the behaviour of the components of the stress - energy tensor in some physically important regimes . 
 below we shall consider expansions of the stress - energy tensor for small @xmath80 large @xmath81 and study the configuration near and at the extremality limit . 
 special attention will be put on the regularity issues and the interior of the extreme abgb black hole . 
 each component of @xmath82 in the abgb spacetime has a general form @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are numerical coefficients depending on the spin of the field . for simplicity , 
 we have omitted tensor indices in right hand side of the above equation . 
 this result can be contrasted with the analogous expression obtained for the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xmath88 where @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , as before , the numerical coefficients depending on @xmath92 in both cases the stress - energy tensor is covariantly conserved and falls as @xmath93as @xmath94 the latter behavior indicates that there is no need to impose spherical boxes in the back reaction calculations . 
 moreover , both tensors are regular at the event horizon . 
 since the lagrangian density of the classical ( nonlinear ) field considered in this paper tends to its maxwell analogue as @xmath95 one expects that in this limit , regardless of the spin of the quantized field , the leading behavior of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive fields is similar to the analogous terms constructed in the reissner - nordstrm geometry . on the other hand , for the configurations near the extremality limit the differences between the tensors outside the event horizon should be more prominent . 
 it can be demonstrated that the difference between the radial and time components of the stress - energy tensor factorizes : @xmath96 f\left ( x\right ) ,   \label{factorize}\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a regular function . 
 now , let us consider a freely falling frame . 
 a simple calculation shows that  the frame components of the tensor @xmath98 are @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the energy per unit mass along the geodesic . 
 one concludes , therefore , that since all components of @xmath103 are regular and  @xmath104 is by ( [ factorize ] ) finite , the stress - energy tensor of the quantize massive fields is regular in freely falling frame . 
 let us postpone the detailed analysis of the stress - energy tensor in the abgb spacetime for a while and consider a far more simple case of the @xmath106 geometry . 
 such geometries are closely related to the extremal black holes . 
 indeed , @xmath106 can be obtained by expanding the geometry of the vicinity of the event horizon into a whole manifold . 
 various aspects of the geometries of this type have been discussed , for example , in  @xcite . 
 the extremal abgb black hole is described by a line element ( [ line_abg ] ) with @xmath107 .\ ] ] now , in order to investigate the geometry in the vicinity of the event horizon , @xmath108 and to obtain uniform approximation we introduce new coordinates @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 expanding the function @xmath44 in powers of @xmath112 retaining quadratic terms and subsequently taking the limit @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114 since @xmath115 the line element does not belong to the bertotti - robinson class , contrary to the near - horizon geometry of the reissner - nordstrm solution . 
 alternatively , this can easily be demonstrated making use of the relation @xmath116 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate , as the stress - energy tensor of the nonlinear electromagnetic field , @xmath117 has nonvanishing trace at the event horizon . 
 other frequently used representations of the line element ( [ brdeformed2 ] ) can be obtained through the change of coordinate system . 
 using , for example , @xmath118 and @xmath119 one obtains @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . 
 topologically the geometry described by the line element ( [ brdeformed2 ] ) is a direct product of the two - dimensional anti - de sitter geometry and the two - sphere of constant curvature ; its curvature scalar is simply a sum of the curvatures of the subspaces @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126    now , let us return to the stress - energy tensor of the massive fields . 
 simple calculations yield @xmath127 _ { \mu } ^{\nu } ,                    \label{eeextr}\ ] ] where @xmath128 @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 for spinor and vector fields , respectively . in view of our earlier discussion 
 we expect that the results ( [ eeextr]-[extr4 ] ) coincide with the components of the stress - energy tensor calculated at the event horizon of the extremal abgb black hole . 
 the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive spinor and vector fields in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime has been constructed in ref . 
 it turns out that although the general formulas describing @xmath82 are rather complicated , its components calculated in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime are simple functions of the radial coordinate due to the spherical symmetry and the form of the metric potentials 
 . these results will be used for the comparison with the analogous results obtained in the abgb spacetime and we reproduce them here for the reader s convenience . 
 the components of the spinor field read @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 similarly , for the massive vector field one has @xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137 although there are no numeric calculations of the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive spinor and vector fields against which one could test the results ( [ t12]- [ a1 ] ) , we expect that the approximation is reasonable so long the mass of the field is sufficiently large . 
 thanks to the detailed analytical and numerical calculations carried out in refs . 
 @xcite we know that this is indeed the case for the massive scalar field . 
 it is a very important result , indicating that that the exact stress - energy tensor of the scalar field may satisfactorily be approximated with the accuracy within a few percent provided @xmath138 . 
 further , as the sixth - order wkb - approach employed in  @xcite is equivalent to the schwinger - dewitt expansion in inverse powers of @xmath139 this affirmative result yields a positive verification of the latter approach .    finally , let us consider the stress - energy tensor of the massive fields in the spacetime of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole . 
 its horizon value is given by @xmath140 ,                \label{ber_rob}\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 it can be easily demonstrated that it coincides with the stress - energy tensor of the massive field in the bertotti - robinson geometry . 
 now , let us return to abgb geometry and consider @xmath143 near the event horizon of the extremal black hole . 
 it can be shown that the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive spinor field for @xmath144 close to @xmath145 may be approximated by @xmath146 + o\left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) ^{2 } , \label{x12}\ ] ] where @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xmath150 numerically , one has @xmath151 _ { \mu } ^{\nu }   \notag \\ & & -\frac{1}{m^{2}m_{h}^{6}}10^{-4}\mathrm{diag}\left [ 5.958,\,5.958,\,0.780 , \,0.780\right ] _ { \mu } ^{\nu } \left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) + o\left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) ^{2}.   \label{num12}\end{aligned}\ ] ] to this end , observe that @xmath152 limit of @xmath153([x12 ] ) coincides with the stress - energy tensor of the massive spinor field in @xmath154 spacetime . to demonstrate this 
 , it suffices to substitute into eqs . 
 ( [ extr1 ] ) and ( [ extr1a ] ) the explicit forms of @xmath155 and @xmath156 as given by eqs ( [ xextr ] ) and ( [ h_expr ] ) , respectively . 
 having established the expansion of the components of the stress - energy tensor for the extremal configuration let us analyze their leading behavior for @xmath157 it can be shown that expanding the stress - energy tensor in powers of @xmath158 one obtains @xmath159 where @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath163 is given by eqs . ( [ t12]-[a12 ] ) . 
 inspection of ( [ t12]-[a12 ] ) and ( [ qa12]-[qc12 ] ) indicates that for @xmath164 the stress - energy tensor of the quantized spinor field constructed in the spacetime of the abgb black hole is almost indistinguishable form the analogous tensor evaluated in the reissner - nordstrm geometry as they differ by @xmath165 terms . 
 now , let us consider the leading behavior of the stress - energy tensor at large distances ( @xmath166 ) . after some algebra the expansion valid for any @xmath69 may be written as @xmath167 where @xmath168 @xmath169 and @xmath170 once again , the leading behavior of @xmath171 as @xmath172 ( which is governed by the first term in the above equations and strongly depends on @xmath69 ) is identical to the analogous behavior in the reissner - nordstrm case . on the other hand , substituting @xmath173 into eqs . 
 ( [ s12rt]-[s12ra ] ) one obtains the expansion of the stress - energy tensor at large distances from the event horizon of the extreme black holes . 
 it should be noted , however , that any comparison of the extremal abgb and reissner - nordstrm black holes should be interpreted with care as the extremality limit occurs for different values of @xmath174      the calculations of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive vector fields proceed along the same lines as for the spinor case . repeating the steps necessary to calculate the set of the massive spinor field and focusing attention on the narrow strip near the degenerate event horizon of the extremal black hole 
 , one has @xmath175 
 + \mathcal{o}\left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) ^{2 } , \label{expansion_vector}\ ] ] where @xmath176 @xmath177 and @xmath178 @xmath179 since the location of the event horizon as well as the value of @xmath180 depend on the particular value of the lambert function one can easily determine numerical value of the components of the stress - energy tensor on the event horizon . making use of ( [ expansion_vector ] ) one obtains @xmath181 _ 
 { \mu } ^{\nu }   \notag \\ & & -\frac{1}{m^{2}m_{h}^{6}}10^{-4}\mathrm{diag}\left [ 35.563,\,35.563 , \,63.376,\,63.376\right ] _ { \mu } ^{\nu } \left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) + \mathcal{o}\left ( x - x_{extr}\right ) ^{2}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] using , once again , eqs.([xextr ] ) and ( [ h_expr ] ) one can easily demonstrate that the horizon value of the stress - energy tensor ( [ expansion_vector ] ) reduces to that calculated in @xmath182 geometry .    for any value of the radial coordinate and small @xmath80 
 the stress - energy tensor may be approximated by @xmath183 where @xmath184 @xmath185 and @xmath186 now , expanding the general stress - energy tensor of the vector field for @xmath166 one obtains the leading terms ( valid for any @xmath69 ) in the form @xmath187 where @xmath188 @xmath189 and @xmath190 finally observe that the @xmath191 limit taken in eqs . 
 ( [ veve1]-[veve4 ] ) supplements the discussion of the extremal black holes . 
 the results presented in sec .  [ sec_spin ] and  [ sec_vect ] can be applied in further calculations . in the proofs of various theorems in general relativity , for example 
 , the stress - energy tensor is expected to satisfy some restrictions usually addressed to as the energy conditions . 
 their detailed studies are worthwhile as the violation of the energy conditions frequently leads to exotic , yet physically interesting situations . of course , the main role played by the renormalized stress - energy tensor is to serve as the source term of the semi - classical einstein field equations . for the problem on hand 
 one can calculate the back reaction on the metric in the first - order approximation . 
 unfortunately , the components of the metric tensor of the quantum - corrected spacetime are rather complicated functions of the radial coordinate , each consisting of several hundred terms  @xcite . 
 therefore , to analyze the quantum - corrected spacetime it is necessary to refer to approximations or even to numerical calculations .      in this subsection we shall analyze the stress - energy tensor inside the extremal abgb black hole . 
 the line element inside the degenerate horizon is regular , and , for @xmath192  it behaves as @xmath193 this may be contrasted with the analogous behavior of the reissner - nordstrm solution @xmath194    even without detailed calculations certain qualitative features of @xmath195 can be deduced from this formulas . 
 indeed , since the stress - energy tensor is constructed form the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives up to certain order and contractions , the result of all this operations , in view of the asymptotic relation ( [ asymp1 ] ) , should be regular . 
 this can also be demonstrated using eq . 
 ( [ structure ] ) , which , in the case in hand , can be written in the form @xmath196 where for each component @xmath197 are numerical coefficient depending on the spin of the massive field ( we have omitted tensor indices to make the formulas more transparent ) . 
 alternatively , one can utilize approximation of the components of the stress - energy tensor valid small @xmath49 @xmath198 inspection of eqs . 
 ( [ asymp2a ] ) or ( [ asymp2 ] ) shows that @xmath199 as @xmath200 this is simply because the schwinger - dewitt approximation is local and depends on the geometric terms constructed from the curvature . since the line element has the euclidean asymptotic as @xmath201 then , regardless of the spin of the field , the renormalized stress - energy tensor must vanish in that limit . 
 it should be noted , however , that the regularity of the source term does not necessarily leads to the regularity of the quantum corrected geometry . 
 indeed , the latter requires that various curvature invariants of the self - consistent solution of the semi - classical equations with the total source term given by the sum of classical stress - energy tensor of the nonlinear electrodynamics and of the quantized massive fields be regular . 
 however , since the resulting semi - classical equations comprise a very complicated system of sixth - order differential equations , there are no simple way to construct the appropriate solutions . 
 a comprehensive discussion of the analogous situation in the quadratic gravity has been carried out in  @xcite . 
 considerations of the previous sections concentrated on the approximate analytical results valid in a few important regimes : @xmath164 , @xmath202 and for extremal configuration . 
 now , to gain insight into the overall behavior of the stress - energy tensor as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath80 one has to refer to numerical calculations , as our complete but rather complicated results are , unfortunately , not very illuminating . 
 below we describe the main features of the constructed tensors and present them graphically . 
 related discussion of the spin 0 field has been carried out in refs.@xcite . 
 first , let us consider the horizon values of the components of @xmath203 spherical symmetry and regularity impose severe constrains on the structure of the stress - energy tensor at the event horizon . 
 it suffices , therefore , to consider only its two independent components , say , @xmath204 and @xmath205 the run of this components as functions of @xmath69 is exhibited in figs . 1 and 2 , for spinor and vector fields , respectively . 
 the run of the stress - energy tensor for a several exemplary values of @xmath69 is exhibited in figs . 
 each curve represents the radial dependence of the rescaled component of @xmath206 for a given @xmath174 we shall start our discussion of the numerical results with the spin-@xmath207 field . 
 first , observe that the energy density @xmath208 is always negative at the event horizon , and , thus , by continuity , it is negative in its vicinity . 
 further @xmath209 attains a positive local maximum as can be clearly seen in fig 3 . for @xmath210 
 the energy density develops a negative minium ( fig . 
 4 ) and goes to @xmath211as @xmath212 . 
 further , inspection of the leading behavior of eq . 
 ( [ s12rt ] ) shows that @xmath209 is positive at large distances for @xmath213    the radial pressure @xmath214 @xmath215 is positive at the event horizon and @xmath216 @xmath217 ; subsequently , it decreases monotonically to @xmath218 with @xmath49 . the behavior of @xmath219 is plotted in fig . 
 5 .    the tangential pressure , 
 @xmath220 is plotted in figs . 6 and 7 . at the event horizon 
 it is positive for @xmath221 , approaches a negative minimum at @xmath222 and goes to @xmath211 as @xmath223 a closer examination indicates that for @xmath224 it develops a local maximum , which disappears near the extremality limit .    in general 
 , there are no qualitative similarities between components of the renormalized stress - enegy tensor of the massive spinor and vector fields , as can be easily seen in figs . 
 8 - 13 . in the vicinity of the event horizon 
 the energy density of the massive vector field is positive for @xmath225 and negative otherwise . for @xmath226 
 the energy density approaches a maximum , and , subsequently , regardless of @xmath69 it has a minimum . as the leading behavior as @xmath212 
 is governed by the first term in rhs of ( [ vevet ] ) , @xmath227 other qualitative and quantitative features of the energy density can easily be inferred from figs . 
 8 and 9 . 
 numerical calculations indicate that for @xmath228 the radial pressure , @xmath229 is negative and monotonically increases to @xmath230 as @xmath49 @xmath231 for @xmath232 @xmath233 there appears a local minimum in the closest neighborhood of the event horizon , and , for @xmath234 , the radial pressure approaches a local maximum . 
 finally , for @xmath235 , it decreases monotonically to @xmath236 the run of @xmath237 for a few exemplary values of @xmath69 is plotted in figs . 
 10 and 11 . 
 the tangential pressure of the vector field is negative on the event horizon and increases to a global maximum . 
 subsequent behavior of @xmath238 depends on @xmath69 : it decreases monotonically to @xmath239 for @xmath240 whereas for @xmath241 the tangential pressure has a local minimum and increases to @xmath242 some other qualitative and quantitative features , as for example the numerical values of @xmath243 at the maxima and minima can easily be inferred from figs . 
 12 and 13 . 
 the numerical calculations carried out in the external region of the extremal configuration shows that the run of the stress - energy tensor qualitatively follows the analogous behavior for @xmath244 case , and , consequently , it will not be discussed separately . 
 now , let us consider the vacuum polarization effects inside the event horizon of the extremal configuration . 
 the run of the rescaled components of stress - energy tensor of the massive spinor field is exhibited in figs 14 - 16 . 
 all the components display oscillatory behavior for @xmath245 indicating that the back reaction effects would be especially interesting there . 
 such a behavior can easily be understood in relation with the behavior of the line element . 
 indeed , for small @xmath49 the line element closely resembles that of a flat spacetime , and , consequently , the vacuum polarization effects are small . on the other hand , for @xmath246 the function @xmath44 changes noticeably leading to the changes of the stress - energy tensor . 
 the competition of the local geometric terms @xmath247 lead to its oscillatory - like behavior . 
 numerical calculations indicate that the stress - energy tensor of the quantized vector field is qualitatively similar to that of the spinor field and approximately one has @xmath248 the basic features of the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive vector field can easily be infrred form figs . 
 14 - 16 and the above relation . 
 in this paper we have constructed the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive spinor and vector fields in the spacetime of abgb black hole . 
 the scalar case has been analyzed extensively in our two previous papers . 
 the method employed here is based on the observation that the first - order effective action could be expressed in terms of the ( traced ) coincidence limit of the coefficient @xmath249 functional differentiation of this action with respect to the metric tensor yields the most general first - order ( i.e. proportional to @xmath12 ) stress - energy tensor . 
 such a generic tensors of the quantized massive scalar , spinor and vector fields have been constructed for the first time in  @xcite . 
 application of our general formulas , although conceptually straightforward , is technically rather intricate , and produces quite complex results . 
 therefore , for clarity , we have analyzed the leading behavior of @xmath82 in some physically important regimes . 
 this discussion has been supplemented with detailed numerical calculations . 
 the results have also been used to construct and analyze the stress - energy tensor in @xmath182 spaces , which are naturally related to the near horizon geometry of the extremal abgb black hole . 
 a special emphasis in this paper has been put on the extremal configurations . 
 specifically , it has been shown that the stress - energy tensor of the massive fields is regular inside the degenerate event horizon . 
 this result raises important question of the nature of the black hole interior in the back - reaction problem . 
 preliminary calculations carried out in  @xcite for the quadratic gravity , which , for certain calculational purposes , may be considered as some sort of a toy model of the semi - classical theory , indicate that at least for the first - order calculations it is possible to obtain regular solution , at the expense of a small modification of the classical nonlinear action . of course , the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive fields constructed in the general static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime is far more complicated than quadratic terms  @xcite , however , the general pattern that lies behind the calculations should be , in general , the same . 
 the calculations carried out so far indicate that this is indeed the case , although lengthy and complicated results expressed in term of the polylogarithms are rather hard to analyze and manipulate . 
 moreover , it would be interesting to investigate the back reaction problem for any @xmath69 outside the event horizon . 
 finally , observe that the abgb solution with the cosmological constant may provide an interesting setting for studying the influence of the quantized fields upon ultraextremal horizons . 
 these problems are being studied and the results will be reported elsewhere .     and @xmath250

53,"the response of precipitation extremes ( heavy precipitation events ) to climate change has been the subject of extensive study because of the potential impacts on human society and ecosystems @xcite . an early study using a 4-level general circulation model found that heavy daily precipitation events become more frequent in response to elevated atmospheric co@xmath0 concentrations @xcite . 
 numerous model studies since then have also found an intensification of precipitation extremes with climate warming ( with important regional variations ) , and this has been confirmed in the available historical record over land , as will be discussed in detail in later sections . 
 understanding of changes in precipitation extremes is better than for changes in other extremes such as tornadoes @xcite , but large uncertainties and research challenges remain . 
 if changes in dynamics and precipitation efficiency are negligible , precipitation extremes increase with warming because of increases in the saturation vapor pressure of water @xcite ; this will be made more precise in section 3 . 
 however , dynamical contributions and changes in precipitation efficiency may also play an important role . 
 mesoscale convective organization is important for the dynamics of precipitation extremes in the tropics ( and seasonally in the midlatitudes ) but it is not resolved in global models , while at the same time there are relatively few observational records of tropical precipitation extremes for estimating long - term trends and sensitivities . at higher latitudes , 
 the effect of climate change on snowfall extremes and freezing rain will be different from its effect on rainfall extremes and requires further study . in terms of impacts , 
 the duration of extreme precipitation events and the response of orographic precipitation extremes are both important and are only now receiving substantial research attention . 
 this paper reviews and elaborates on some of the recent research on how climate change affects precipitation extremes , including observed changes in the historical record ( section 2 ) , physical theory ( section 3 ) , climate - model projections ( section 4 ) , orographic precipitation extremes ( section 5 ) , snowfall extremes ( section 6 ) , and the duration of precipitation extremes ( section 7 ) . 
 the primary focus is on the physical factors that control the intensity of precipitation extremes in different climates . 
 open questions are discussed throughout and in section 8 . 
 latitude bands relative to ( a ) global - mean surface temperature or ( b ) mean surface temperature over the 15@xmath1 latitude band . 
 precipitation is from hadex2 , sensitivities are calculated for gridboxes with at least 30 annual values , and the median sensitivity is plotted for each 15@xmath1 latitude band . 
 temperatures are over land and ocean from noaa mlost , and for ( b ) the temperature timeseries were smoothed with a 9-year running - mean filter . ]    records of precipitation that are sufficient to detect long term trends in extremes are primarily from rain gauges over land . over the available record , there are regions with both increasing and decreasing trends in precipitation extremes @xcite , as might be expected given large internal variability @xcite , but the gridboxes or stations with significant increasing trends outnumber those with significant decreasing trends @xcite . 
 anthropogenic forcing has been shown to have contributed to the intensification of precipitation extremes over northern hemisphere land @xcite . 
 assessments have also been made of the effect of anthropogenic forcing on the probability of specific extreme precipitation or flooding events using ensembles of climate - model simulations @xcite . 
 one approach that reduces the influence of unforced variability while still distinguishing large - scale variations is to analyze the sensitivity of precipitation extremes averaged over all stations or grid boxes in a latitude band @xcite . 
 figure [ fig_obs]a shows an example of this type of analysis in which annual - maximum daily precipitation rates over land from the hadex2 gridded dataset @xcite have been regressed over the period 1901 to 2010 against temperature anomalies from noaa s merged land - ocean surface temperature analysis ( mlost ) @xcite . 
 the precipitation rates are over land only , but precipitation extremes do not necessarily scale with the local land mean temperature because of advection of water vapor from over the ocean such as in atmospheric rivers @xcite , and the temperatures used here are over both land and ocean . for each gridbox with at least 30 years of data , the annual - maximum daily precipitation rates are regressed against the global - mean surface temperature anomalies using the theil - sen estimator , and the regression coefficient is divided by the mean of the annual - maximum daily precipitation rate at the gridbox to give a sensitivity that is expressed in units of % k@xmath2 . 
 the median of the sensitivities is then calculated for all gridboxes in 15@xmath1 latitude bands . 
 the resulting sensitivity is positive for most latitude bands , the 90% confidence interval is above zero for all latitude bands in the northern hemisphere , and the global sensitivity ( averaging over latitude bands with area weighting ) is 8% k@xmath2 with a 90% confidence interval of 5 to 10 % k@xmath2 . 
 these results , similar to those obtained previously @xcite , provide evidence for an intensification of annual - maximum daily precipitation as the global - mean temperature has risen over the last century , and at a rate that is roughly consistent with what might be expected from theory . however , the meridional structure of the sensitivities within the tropics is sensitive to the details of the analysis ( cf . 
 @xcite ) . 
 extratropical precipitation extremes at a given latitude occur when the atmosphere is warmer than average and are more closely tied to mean temperatures somewhat further equatorward @xcite . 
 however , they are still expected to respond primarily to changes in mean temperatures in the extratropics rather than the tropics , and recent warming has been greater in the northern extratropics than the tropics . 
 the sensitivities shown in fig .  [ fig_obs]a are based on global - mean surface temperature and do not account for the variation in warming with latitude . 
 [ fig_obs]b shows an alternative analysis in which the annual - maximum daily precipitation rates at each gridbox are regressed against the area - weighted mean temperature anomaly for the 15@xmath1 latitude band that contains the gridbox . 
 the latitude - band temperature timeseries are filtered using a nine - year running mean prior to performing the regression . 
 this filtering reduces the influence of short - term variability in regional temperatures which has previously been found to give a different sensitivity of precipitation extremes than long - term climate change @xcite . the results in fig . 
 [ fig_obs]b show a higher sensitivity of precipitation extremes in the tropics compared to the extratropics , although the uncertainty in the tropics is large reflecting the sparse data there . 
 the sensitivity for the tropics ( 30s to 30n ) is 9% k@xmath2 ( 90% confidence interval 6 - 14% k@xmath2 ) , while for the extratropics it is 4% k@xmath2 ( 90% confidence interval 2 - 5% k@xmath2 ) . 
 the choice of filter for the temperature time series affects the overall magnitudes of the sensitivities but not whether sensitivities are higher in the tropics than the extratropics . 
 interestingly , higher sensitivities in the tropics are also found when projections from global climate models are constrained by satellite observations @xcite as discussed in section 4.2 . 
 to understand the response of precipitation extremes to warming , our starting point is an approximation for the surface precipitation rate @xmath3 in an extreme precipitation event , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a precipitation efficiency , @xmath6 is the vertical velocity in pressure coordinates ( negative for upward motion ) , @xmath7 is the derivative of the saturation specific humidity @xmath8 with respect to pressure @xmath9 taken at constant saturation equivalent potential temperature @xmath10 ( i.e. , the derivative along a moist adiabat ) , and @xmath11 is a mass - weighted vertical integral over the troposphere @xcite . 
 all quantities in equation ( [ scaling ] ) are evaluated locally in the extreme event . 
 the net condensation rate is approximated by @xmath12 either through consideration of the condensation rate in a rising saturated air parcel @xcite or using a dry static energy budget in the tropics @xcite . 
 the precipitation efficiency @xmath5 is defined as the ratio of surface precipitation to the column - integrated net condensation ; it accounts for condensate and precipitation storage or transport from the column . 
 note that @xmath5 is not a conventional precipitation efficiency because it is defined in terms of net condensation ( condensation minus evaporation ) rather than condensation . 
 according to equation ( [ scaling ] ) , changes in the precipitation rate in extreme events under climate change have a dynamical contribution from changes in @xmath6 , a thermodynamic contribution from changes in @xmath13 ( this is termed thermodynamic since @xmath13 only depends on temperature and pressure ) , and a microphysical component from changes in the precipitation efficiency @xmath5 . 
 relative humidity does not explicitly appear in equation ( [ scaling ] ) , but it can affect precipitation extremes through the dynamics and by helping to set the duration of precipitation events . 
 the fractional increase in @xmath13 with warming is influenced by changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate @xcite and varies strongly depending on temperature and therefore altitude in the atmosphere . 
 however , for a moist - adiabatic stratification and convergence confined to near the surface , the thermodynamic contribution can be shown to scale in a similar way to near surface specific humidities @xcite . 
 this scaling is often referred to as clausius - clapeyron scaling and gives a sensitivity of 6 - 7% k@xmath2 for typical surface temperatures . 
 more generally , the thermodynamic contribution depends on the weighting of @xmath13 by the vertical velocity profile in the vertical integral in equation ( [ scaling ] ) , and a range of higher and lower rates of change from the thermodynamic contribution have been found in different simulations @xcite . 
 it is sometimes stated that the dynamical contribution must be positive for a warming climate because of increases in latent heating , but this is not necessarily the case because other factors such as increases in dry static stability or reductions in meridional temperature gradients can counteract the increases in latent heating . instead 
 , the dynamical contribution is discussed here separately for different dynamical regimes . 
 for example , increases in convective updraft velocities with warming are discussed in the next paragraph , and changes in large - scale vertical velocities in the extratropics are discussed in section 4.1 using the omega equation .    the simplest configuration for which the contributions to changes in precipitation extremes have been analyzed is radiative - convective equilibrium ( rce ) in a doubly periodic domain @xcite . 
 there are no large - scale dynamics in rce , and cloud - system resolving models ( crms ) are used to resolve the convective - scale dynamics . both the convective available potential energy ( cape ) and the updraft velocities in the middle and upper troposphere increase with warming in rce @xcite ; as the atmosphere warms the thermal stratification remains close to neutral to a strongly entraining plume , and this implies increases in cape ( calculated based on a non - entraining parcel ) and increases in updraft velocities for more weakly entraining plumes @xcite . 
 but the increases in updraft velocities in the upper troposphere do not strongly affect the precipitation extremes because the factor of @xmath14 in equation ( [ scaling ] ) gives more weight to the vertical velocities in the lower troposphere in determining the intensity of precipitation extremes . for surface temperatures near those of the present - day tropics , the precipitation extremes increase at close to the thermodynamic rate , and 
 this is close to clausius - clapeyron scaling with the surface specific humidity , with relatively small contributions from changes in vertical velocities and precipitation efficiency @xcite . 
 the same behavior is found when convection is organized in a squall line @xcite . 
 however , for temperatures below 295k , the precipitation efficiency can change substantially with warming and the scaling of precipitation extremes then depends on the accumulation period considered @xcite , as discussed in section 7 . 
 climate models provide global coverage for precipitation extremes @xcite and more detailed coverage on regional scales @xcite . 
 they may be applied to different emissions scenarios or individual radiative forcings @xcite , and they allow relatively straightforward investigations into the role of dynamics and other factors that contribute to precipitation intensity @xcite . 
 important limitations in the ability of current models to simulate precipitation extremes have also been recognized and are related in part to the use of parameterized convection @xcite . 
 global models precipitate too frequently with too low a mean precipitation intensity @xcite , but this does not necessarily mean that they underestimate the intensity of precipitation extremes . 
 for example , in an analysis of 30-year return values of daily precipitation over the conterminous united states , most global climate models were found to overestimate or roughly agree with observations that were conservatively interpolated to the model resolution for comparison @xcite . 
 ( appropriate interpolation of precipitation is important because of mismatches in time and space scales between models and observations . ) 
 one exception was the community climate model system 3 which underestimated the 30-year return values @xcite , and increased horizontal resolution @xcite or use of superparameterization @xcite have been shown to improve the representation of the intensity distribution of precipitation in the community atmosphere model versions 2 and 3 . 
 the model bias of too - frequent precipitation mentioned above will affect percentiles calculated over only wet days rather than all days @xcite , even if the extreme events are properly simulated , which suggests that calculating extremes using all days ( or all hours ) is preferable for comparison of precipitation extremes between models and observations . 
 projections of 21st century climate change with global climate models show a general increase in the intensity of precipitation extremes except in some regions in the subtropics @xcite . to illustrate basic features of the response , fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] shows the sensitivity of the 99.9th percentile of daily precipitation to warming as a function of latitude in simulations with 15 global climate models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 ( cmip5 ) . 
 sensitivities for climate change ( % k@xmath2 ) are calculated as the change in the 99.9th percentile between the final two decades of the 20th century in the historical simulations and the final two decades of the 21st century in the warmer rcp8.5 simulations , normalized by the value in the historical simulations and the change in global - mean surface air temperature . 
 latitude bands for presentation in fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] . ] 
 note that the sensitivities from observations in fig .  1 and from simulations in fig .  2 should not be compared in detail because of the different time periods , geographic coverage , and measure of extreme precipitation used . 
 we next discuss the simulated response of extratropical precipitation extremes , followed by tropical precipitation extremes and the use of observed variability to better constrain the intermodel spread . 
 the multimodel - median sensitivity is shown by the green line with circles in fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] , and the multimodel - median of the sensitivity averaged over the extratropics is 6% k@xmath2 . a slightly lower extratropical sensitivity of 5% k@xmath2 is obtained if it is normalized by the change in extratropical - mean surface temperature rather than global - mean surface temperature . 
 the intermodel spread in the response ( dotted lines in fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] ) is small in the extratropics , consistent with the fact that most precipitation extremes there are associated with cyclones and fronts @xcite that may be expected to be reasonably well simulated . 
 however , global models with conventional parameterizations are unable to simulate precipitation extremes from mesoscale convective systems over midlatitudes in summer @xcite , and so the results from these models are not reliable for regions and times of year in which these systems are important . 
 equation ( [ scaling ] ) with the precipitation efficiency @xmath5 held fixed reproduces the fractional changes in precipitation extremes in cmip3 simulations @xcite . 
 the thermodynamic contribution in these simulations is close to what would be expected from scaling of precipitation extremes with surface specific humidity , and this implies a lower rate of increase than scaling with column water vapor @xcite . in the extratropics , the simulated rate of increase of precipitation extremes is close to the thermodynamic contribution at all latitudes , and there is little dynamical contribution from changes in vertical velocities @xcite . a stronger dynamical contribution resembling 
 a poleward shift has been found in idealized aquaplanet simulations @xcite . 
 why is there no general strengthening or weakening of large - scale vertical velocities associated with simulated extratropical precipitation extremes despite changes in latent heating and dry static stability ? 
 as a starting point , consider the quasigeostrophic omega equation written as @xmath15 where @xmath6 is the vertical velocity in pressure coordinates , @xmath16 is the dry static stability parameter , @xmath17 is the diabatic heating rate , @xmath18 is the ratio of the gas constant to the specific heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath9 is pressure , @xmath19 is a reference value of the coriolis parameter , and the right - hand - side ( @xmath20 ) includes vorticity and temperature advection terms but not the static stability or diabatic heating rate @xcite . 
 this equation is the simplest equation for the vertical velocity that accounts for dynamical balance , and it is used here to gain some insight into the controls on large - scale vertical velocities in the extratropics , although it is not expected to be quantitatively accurate . in a strong non - convective event with saturated ascent , @xmath17 will be dominated by latent heating and @xmath21 is a measure of the moist static stability 
 . this moist static stability will be small if the stratification is close to moist adiabatic , as was the case , for example , in the extreme precipitation event in the colorado front range in september 2013 @xcite . for a region of upward motion that is sufficiently broad in the horizontal with small moist static stability , 
 the omega equation ( [ omega_equation ] ) reduces to @xmath22 , and the effect of climate change on the vertical velocity @xmath6 does not depend on changes in static stability or latent heating . 
 the vertical velocity still depends on rhs , but changes in this would be expected to be relatively small given modest changes in eddy kinetic energy @xcite and eddy length @xcite . 
 the omega equation ( [ omega_equation ] ) gives , therefore , some insight as to why the vertical velocities associated with large - scale extratropical precipitation extremes might not change greatly under climate change . 
 the term proportional to @xmath23 on the left hand side of equation ( [ omega_equation ] ) arises from planetary rotation and it makes the large - scale vertical velocity much less sensitive to deviations from a moist adiabatic stratification when compared to small - scale convective updrafts ( see sections 3 and 7 ) . 
 we next turn to the tropics where the dynamical influence of planetary rotation is weaker and where convection is always a key factor for precipitation extremes .      as compared to the extratropics , 
 the intermodel range in the sensitivity of precipitation extremes is much larger in the tropics ( fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] ) , with close to zero sensitivity in some models and greater than 30%k@xmath2 in others . 
 additional reasons to doubt the response of tropical precipitation extremes in these global climate models include the large differences between tropical precipitation extremes in 20th - century simulations in different models @xcite , the inability of the models to represent mesoscale convective organization @xcite or to simulate the interannual variability in tropical precipitation extremes when compared to observations @xcite , and the disproportionate increases in precipitation extremes compared to other parts of the precipitation distribution that is found in some models  an `` extreme mode '' in the tropical response to climate change that relates to gridpoint storms @xcite . 
 observations can be used to better constrain the large uncertainty in the response of tropical precipitation extremes to warming . 
 the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for climate change in different climate models is correlated with their sensitivity for shorter term variability within a climate ( variability that is primarily related to el nio - southern oscillation ) @xcite . 
 for example , models with a relatively high sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for climate change also have a relatively high sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for variability in historical simulations , although the sensitivities for climate change and variability are generally different in value . 
 the robust relationship between the sensitivities across models has been used together with observed variability to constrain the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes to climate change @xcite . the black line in fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] shows a similar observationally - constrained estimate of the sensitivity of the 99.9th percentile of daily precipitation for climate change , but instead of considering the sensitivity for climate change aggregated over the whole tropics as in @xcite , the analysis is applied separately to the sensitivity for climate change in 10@xmath1 latitude bands in both the tropics and extratropics . ) 
 is calculated in both models and observations based on the 99.9th percentile of daily precipitation rates aggregated over the tropical oceans and the mean surface temperature over the tropical oceans ( 30s to 30n ) as described in detail in @xcite . 
 the sensitivities for climate change are calculated in 10@xmath1 latitude bands relative to the change in global - mean surface temperature , as for the other sensitivities shown in fig . 
 [ fig_cmip5 ] . 
 differences in convective parameterizations are less important in the extratropics , and the correlation coefficient across models between the sensitivities for climate change and variability becomes smaller for climate change at higher latitudes , reaching a value of 0.5 at 50s and 40n as compared to a maximum of 0.86 at 20n . 
 ssm / i data from remote sensing systems @xcite are used for the observed precipitation rates and noaa mlost data @xcite for the observed temperatures . ] 
 this observationally - constrained estimate is similar to the multimodel median in the extratropics but higher than the multimodel median in the tropics . 
 it peaks near the equator and is higher for the tropics ( 11 % k@xmath2 , 90% confidence interval 7 - 15 % k@xmath2 ) than the extratropics ( 6 % k@xmath2 , 90% confidence interval 6 - 7% k@xmath2 ) . 
 interestingly , a higher sensitivity in the tropics compared to the extratropics was also found using historical rain - gauge data ( section 2 ) . 
 for the tropics , there still remains considerable uncertainty in both the estimate from rain - gauge data and the observationally constrained estimate discussed in this section , and better constraining the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes is an important research challenge . 
 idealized simulations have recently been used to study the response of orographic precipitation extremes to climate warming @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more general discussion ) . 
 a striking result from these studies is that there are higher fractional changes in precipitation extremes on the climatological leeward slope of the mountain as compared to the windward slope . 
 orographic precipitation extremes must be treated as a special case for several reasons . 
 the thermodynamic contribution is influenced by the vertical profile of the vertical velocity ( see equation 1 ) , and the shape of this profile will generally be different over a sloped lower boundary than over a flat lower boundary @xcite 
 . downstream transport of precipitation means that the local precipitation efficiency can vary strongly over the mountain , and the condensation that leads to leeward precipitation may occur relatively high in the atmosphere where sensitivities to temperature change are greater @xcite . 
 in addition , changes in vertical velocities are governed by mountain wave dynamics and have been found to be different for extreme precipitation events on the western and eastern slopes of an idealized midlatitude mountain @xcite . 
 a weakening of orographic rain shadows related to changes in precipitation extremes has previously been noted in simulations of climate warming over north america @xcite . 
 further study is needed to assess the role played by the physical factors discussed above in determining changes in orographic precipitation extremes in comprehensive simulations and observations . 
 changes in snowfall extremes have received relatively little research attention , party because of the difficulties in producing long - term records of snowfall . 
 observational studies of daily snowfall extremes have been regional in nature and have found large interdecadal variability with , for example , no long term trend for canada @xcite but more frequent extremes snowstorms in recent decades in the eastern two - thirds of the united states @xcite . 
 studies using different metrics have reached different conclusions as to whether there are more heavy snowfall events in anomalously warm or cold years or seasons in the united states @xcite    physically , snowfall extremes are expected to be affected by climate warming through both increases in saturation vapor pressures and changes in the frequency of occurrence of temperatures below the rain - snow transition temperature . 
 a simple asymptotic theory of snowfall extremes has been developed based on the temperature dependencies of precipitation extremes and the rain - snow transition @xcite . according to the simple theory , 
 snowfall extremes tend to occur near an optimal temperature of roughly -2@xmath1c when snowfall is measured by liquid water equivalent . 
 the optimal temperature arises because saturation vapor pressures increase with temperature whereas the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow reduces sharply at surface temperatures near freezing . 
 when snowfall is measured by depth of snow , the optimal temperature is lower ( roughly -4@xmath1c ) because the variation of snow density with temperature must also be taken into account . for an infinitesimal climate warming , the intensity of snowfall extremes decreases for climatological - mean temperatures above the optimal temperature and increases for climatological - mean temperatures below it . 
 furthermore , fractional changes in high percentiles of snowfall are smaller the higher the percentile considered ( unlike for rainfall extremes ) , such that fractional changes in the intensity of the most extreme events tend to be relatively small . 
 there may still be large fractional decreases in snowfall extremes with warming in regions with climatologically mild temperatures , and changes in the frequency of exceeding a high threshold of snowfall may still be substantial . 
 snowfall extremes in simulations with global climate models from cmip5 behave similarly to the simple theory for sufficiently extreme statistics @xcite , although the climatological temperature below which snowfall extremes intensify is lower than the simple theory predicts . 
 the response of snowfall extremes is similar in the subset of models that most realistically simulate arctic sea ice @xcite , the decline of which has been hypothesized to affect midlatitude weather extremes @xcite 
 .    regional climate - model simulations exhibit large fractional decreases in maximum winter daily snowfall over much of western europe , but little change or increases in other parts of europe that are climatologically colder @xcite . 
 as in the simple theory and in global climate - model simulations , there is a strong link in regional simulations @xcite and downscaled global simulations @xcite between the changes in snowfall extremes and the local climatological temperature in the control climate . 
 ) are calculated as the change for a 3k warming . ] 
 the impact of changes in precipitation extremes depends on the duration of precipitation considered ( i.e. , the accumulation period ) . in a recent climate - model study , 
 intensity - duration - frequency curves were calculated for accumulation periods from 6 hours to 10 days , and the curves were found to shift upwards in intensity on a logarithmic scale in a relatively simple way as the climate warms @xcite . 
 however , it is not clear that global climate models can be relied on for subdaily extremes because of the potential importance of convective processes . indeed , for regional simulations of midlatitudes in summer , changing from a model with convective parameterization to a crm has been found to lead to a marked improvement in the intensity distribution of hourly precipitation @xcite and to significantly alter the simulated response of hourly precipitation extremes to climate change @xcite . 
 long - term observational records of subdaily precipitation are relatively sparse , which makes it difficult to give a general assessment of trends in subdaily extremes @xcite . 
 many recent observational studies have instead focussed on the relationship between short - duration precipitation rates and the local surface temperature in variability within the current climate . in the first of these studies , a high resolution record from the netherlands 
 was found to give a sensitivity of @xmath24k@xmath2 for daily precipitation as compared to @xmath25k@xmath2 for hourly precipitation over a range of temperatures @xcite . 
 similar behavior was found in some but not all subsequent studies in different regions @xcite ; see @xcite for an in - depth discussion . 
 factors such as relative humidity @xcite , large - scale dynamics and temperature gradients @xcite , and transitions from stratiform to convective precipitation @xcite are thought to be important for the scaling of precipitation extremes with temperature in the current climate , and some of these factors may have a different effect on hourly and daily precipitation . while the sensitivity of precipitation extremes for long term climate change need not be the same as for variability in a given climate @xcite , understanding the sensitivity of subdaily precipitation extremes in the present - day climate is an important starting point . 
 idealized crm studies suggest that changes in both dynamics and precipitation efficiency could contribute to the scaling of subdaily convective precipitation extremes with temperature . 
 convective precipitation extremes have been found to increase with warming considerably faster than implied by clausius - clapeyron scaling in some cases when a temperature increase is imposed that is constant in the vertical @xcite . 
 this is not surprising because a vertically - uniform temperature increase makes a moist atmosphere less statically stable and leads to faster updrafts @xcite , but it does demonstrate that changes in the static stability associated with subdaily extreme precipitation events are worthy of further study . in a related result 
 , temperature changes in climate - change simulations were found to be close to constant in the vertical for high - cape composites in the midlatitudes @xcite .    as discussed in section 3 
 , updrafts do become somewhat faster with warming when lapse rates are allowed to equilibrate ( rather than being imposed ) in simulations of rce , although the dynamical contribution to changes in precipitation extremes is still relatively small @xcite . 
 nonetheless , large deviations from clausius - clapeyron scaling have been found in a study of rce because of changes in precipitation efficiency at mean surface temperatures below 295k @xcite . 
 the 99.99th percentile of precipitation from this study is shown in fig . 
 [ fig_crm]a for durations from instantaneous to daily . 
 warming shifts the percentile curves upwards in intensity in fig . 
 [ fig_crm]a , but the rate at which they shift upwards varies with duration and temperature . as shown in fig . 
 [ fig_crm]b , the precipitation extremes follow clausius - clapeyron scaling at roughly 6 - 7% k@xmath2 for temperatures above 295k . 
 however , for temperatures below 295k the sensitivity varies widely depending on temperature and accumulation period in a manner that is not fully understood . 
 instantaneous precipitation extremes increase at close to double the clausius - clapeyron rate for temperatures below 295k , and this has been shown to be due to increases in precipitation efficiency with warming , related in part to increases in hydrometeor fall speed as more of the precipitation in the column changes from solid to liquid @xcite . 
 such changes in precipitation efficiency might be expected to occur for variability within a climate as well as for longer term climate change , but in the simulations they depend strongly on the choice of cloud microphysics scheme , and it remains to be seen if they are relevant for observed precipitation extremes . 
 as demonstrated in several observational studies , there has been an overall intensification of daily precipitation extremes as a result of global warming , although the available data has limited geographic coverage , and there are large regional variations in the observed trends . 
 much of the characterization of projected changes in precipitation extremes comes from climate models that use parameterized moist convection , but these are not expected to be reliable for precipitation extremes that are primarily convective in nature ( for example , in the tropics or for certain events in summer in the extratropics ) . as a result , simulations that use cloud - system resolving 
 models or superparameterizations are becoming increasingly important to research in this area . 
 even when convective dynamics are resolved , precipitation extremes at short durations have been found to be sensitive to the parameterization of cloud and precipitation microphysics @xcite , and progress in observations and physical understanding remains equally important . 
 contributions from changes in thermodynamics , dynamics , and precipitation efficiency have all been found to be important for changes in precipitation extremes in at least some situations in modeling studies . 
 the thermodynamic contribution is the easiest to understand and always gives an intensification with warming . 
 there is some basic understanding of dynamical contributions at the large - scale from the omega equation ( section 4.1 ) and also at the convective scale in the case of rce ( sections 3 and 7 ) , but only a few studies have focussed on the role of mesoscale convective organization in precipitation extremes @xcite . 
 precipitation extremes associated with particular dynamical regimes or particular precipitation types may respond differently to climate warming and are deserving of special attention . as discussed in section 5 
 , recent idealized studies of orographic precipitation extremes have found that fractional increases are larger on the climatological leeward side than on the windward side , and further work is needed to relate this to more realistic modeling studies and observations . 
 similarly , snowfall extremes behave quite differently from rainfall extremes because they tend to occur near an optimal temperature that is unaffected by climate warming . 
 further work is needed to understand the specific responses of lake - effect and high - elevation snowfall extremes , as well as changes in the frequency of hail and ice storms @xcite . 
 characterizing the dependence of changes in precipitation extremes on duration is of importance for impacts , and this is particularly challenging for subdaily durations . 
 much research has focussed on precipitation accumulated over fixed time periods as discussed in section 7 . 
 an alternative approach is to consider properties of contiguous precipitation events that are defined based on when non - zero precipitation begins and ends @xcite . 
 consideration of the amount of precipitation in a given event ( the event depth ) may be advantageous because observed distributions of event depths exhibit a power law range @xcite and thus their response to climate change may be relatively simple to characterize . 
 daily precipitation extremes in the tropics seem to be more sensitive to climate warming than those in the extratropics , as suggested by results from both rain - gauge observations ( section 2 ) and climate - model projections constrained using satellite observations ( section 4.2 ) . 
 one possible cause is a more positive dynamical contribution in the tropics than the extratropics . 
 changes in extratropical eddy kinetic energy are relatively modest and can be either positive or negative depending on season and hemisphere @xcite , whereas increases in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones are expected as the climate warms @xcite , and tropical cyclones contribute substantially to off - equatorial precipitation extremes in the current climate @xcite . 
 furthermore , increases in the activity of the madden - julian oscillation and convectively - coupled equatorial kelvin waves have been found in simulations with conventional and superparameterized climate models @xcite . 
 the influence of these potential dynamical changes on the aggregate statistics of tropical precipitation extremes remains to be assessed .

54,"magnetic fields , with amplitudes of around 1@xmath6gauss have been observed in galaxies and clusters@xcite . indeed it has been argued that these fields may play a role in galaxy formation and evolution . 
 it is believed that these fields may have arisen from a common mechanism : an amplification of a weak primordial field through adiabatic collapse or some form of cosmic dynamo . 
 there is a suite of proposals for the origin of the primordial field , i.e. the seed field , from phase transitions , to parity violating processes and inflation . in general the seed fields generated by these mechanisms 
 will be stochastic and spatially varying . 
 there is , however , the possibility that the primordial magnetic field is homogeneous , embedded in the large scale fabric of the universe@xcite . 
 all of these possibilities should lead to distinct observational signatures . in this paper 
 we will focus on one such signature , the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . 
 the polarization of the cmb is generated by thomson scattering of the quadrupole temperature anisotropy at the last scattering surface . 
 since the dipole anisotropy does not generate any polarization , the amplitude of the polarization signal will be significantly lower than for the temperature anisotropies , which get most of the power from the scattering of the dipole anisotropy . 
 this low amplitude leads to experimental challenges . 
 however , the different polarization power spectra will provide important and complimentary information to what we can learn from studying the temperature fluctuations alone , and up and coming experiments , such as clover @xcite , ebex @xcite , quiet @xcite , spider @xcite and planck @xcite , will attempt to do measure the cmb polarization signal with unprecedented precision . 
 primordial magnetic fields leads to faraday rotation of cmb polarization . 
 this alters the overall pattern of the cmb polarization by mixing @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes . 
 the effect can play a role on small scales ( in the case of stochastic magnetic fields)@xcite and large scales ( in the case of homogeneous magnetic fields ) @xcite . in this paper 
 we explore the latter and forecast how well we can use future cmb polarization experiments to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic field . 
 the polarization of the cmb can be described in terms of the stokes parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . 
 these parameters quantify the intensity of the incoming radiation in mutually orthogonal directions . 
 the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters are not rotationally invariant and depend on the specific choice of coordinate system . 
 it is therefore convenient to transform to rotationally invariant @xmath7 ( curl free ) and @xmath8 ( divergence free ) modes before comparing observations to theory . 
 these are defined by ( q iu ) ( n ) = - _ lm ( e_lm ib_lm ) _ 
 2y_lm(n ) , where @xmath11 denotes the spin - weighted spherical harmonics . 
 the thomson scattering process will only generate @xmath7 modes from scalar perturbations of the metric and stress energy tensor . in the standard cosmological picture today 
 the @xmath8 modes are only generated by relic gravitational waves from inflation or from gravitational lensing of @xmath7 modes . 
 these two processes will induce a frequency independent @xmath8 mode signal for low @xmath12s and high @xmath12s respectively . 
 @xmath8 modes created by gravitational waves and lensing will lead to a non - zero @xmath3 autocorrelation signal . 
 non - zero correlations between the @xmath8 mode and the @xmath7 or @xmath13 ( temperature ) modes can only occur under processes that break parity invariance . 
 thus , any detection of a non - zero @xmath1 or @xmath2 signal would be a sign of physics beyond the cosmological standard paradigm . 
 a large - scale homogeneous magnetic field is an example of a parity violating field , and the faraday rotation of cmb polarization induced by such a field will indeed result in non - zero @xmath2 and @xmath1 correlations . in an otherwise standard cosmological scenario 
 such a magnetic field will tend to rotate @xmath7 modes generated by thomson scattering into @xmath8 modes . 
 thus one would expect non - zero @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 signals with power spectra similar to the corresponding @xmath7 mode spectra , but with a different amplitude . since faraday rotation is frequency dependent 
 , one would expect the magnitude of this effect to depend on the frequency in which the cmb polarization is observed . 
 the effects of such a large - scale magnetic field on the cmb power spectra were studied @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite 
 the authors looked at the @xmath1 power spectrum and found that one could expect to put upper limits on a primordial magnetic field of the order @xmath14gauss by the planck experiment , where @xmath0 denotes the strength of the magnetic field today . in @xcite the authors derived equations for all the @xmath8 power spectra using the total angular momentum method @xcite . 
 our method for calculating the different cmb power spectra is based on ref . 
 @xcite , and we refer to this paper for further details on the notation and derivations .    the effect of the faraday rotation is conveniently described by the time independent parameter @xmath15 , given by f = 0.7 ( ) ( ) ^2 , where @xmath16 denotes the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath17 is the frequency of the radiation . in @xcite 
 the authors found that , if there are no @xmath8 modes in the absence of a magnetic field , the effect on the cmb @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes by including a non - zero @xmath15 can be expressed by e_lm ib_lm & = & _ l,l  r(lm , l,lm ) ^(l)_lm . where @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients : r(lm , l,lm ) & = & i^l + & & l,l;m - m,m 
 | ll;l , m + & & l,l;0,2 | ll;l,2 . the effect of the magnetic field is hidden in the quantity @xmath19 : e_lm^(l ) & = & -i^l e^ik x y_l^m*(k ) 6 ( 2l+1 ) + & & _ 0^_0 e^-(2l+1)j_l(f ) p^(0 ) ( ) + & & _ l^(0 ) . 
 [ eq : etilde ] this quantity only differs from the standard expression by the extra factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes spherical bessel functions of order @xmath12 and @xmath22 is the optical depth . note that @xmath23 for @xmath24 such that all the introduced corrections reduce to 0 for @xmath25 . for exact definitions of the other quantities appearing in ( [ eq : etilde ] ) 
 we refer to @xcite .    with this definition of @xmath19 the @xmath26 power spectrum 
 is now given by c_l^te = c_l^t e^(0 ) . 
 resulting @xmath26 power spectra for different values of @xmath15 are shown in figure [ fig : cls ] .    for the other power spectra we will only study the limit @xmath27 , which is likely to be a good approximation . in this limit we can neglect contributions from @xmath28 in ( [ eq : etilde ] ) . 
 the @xmath1 correlation can then be approximated by c_l^tb = c_l^te^(1 ) _ m =- l^l ^1/2 [ eq : tb ] here it should be stressed that the @xmath1 correlations are non - diagonal . in the limit of @xmath27 
 the contributions come from the @xmath29 correlations . 
 the @xmath30 given in ( [ eq : tb ] ) then represents a mean of the two off - diagonal contributions . 
 similarly , the @xmath2 correlation can be expressed as c_l^eb = c_l^e^(0 ) e^(1 ) _ m =- l^l ^1/2 [ eq : te ] also here the correlation is off - diagonal and eq . 
 ( [ eq : te ] ) is the mean of the @xmath31 contributions . 
 the autocorrelation polarization power spectra are given by c_l^ee & = & c_l^e^(0 ) e^(0 ) + c_l^bb & = & 13 . 
 the resulting power spectra have been calculated with a modified version of camb @xcite . in figure 
 [ fig : cls ] the power spectra are plotted for different values of @xmath15 with the other cosmological parameters fixed to concordance @xmath32cdm values . from the figure it is obvious that both the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 power spectra are promising targets for constraining @xmath0 , especially since all these power spectra are expected to be zero in the case of @xmath33 .     as a function of multipole @xmath12 . 
 see text for definitions of the different @xmath34.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    note that in the limit @xmath35 @xmath30 and @xmath36 scale linearly with @xmath15 , such that the quantity @xmath37 is constant . 
 the amplitude of the @xmath38 power spectrum will however scale like @xmath39 @xcite . 
 the aim of this work is to forecast the sensitivity of future cmb polarization experiments to the effect of a homogeneous magnetic field as described in section [ sec : cls ] . 
 we will do this using a fisher matrix approach . in our analysis 
 we will assume all cosmological parameters except for @xmath15 to be known . 
 this can be justified since our results are driven by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 correlations , which are zero when @xmath25 . 
 we will also make use of the @xmath3 correlation , but we note that the @xmath3 power spectrum from a homogeneous magnetic field differs significantly from the @xmath3 correlations from gravitational waves and lensing of @xmath7 modes 
 . the amplitude and shape of the different @xmath8 power spectra will indeed depend on the parameters governing the @xmath7 modes , but these parameters are already known with relatively good accuracy , and the precision will of course improve further with upcoming experiments .      fisher matrices are a commonly used tool for forecasting experimental sensitivity . here one uses the curvature of the likelihood function around some fiducial model to predict the error of theoretical parameters given information on experimental parameters of the experiment being considered . in our case , since @xmath15 is the only parameter that is allowed to vary , the fisher matrix will be @xmath40 , and the error in @xmath15 is given by _ 
 f^-2 = _ l [ eq : sigmaf ] , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the expected error in @xmath45 in a given experiment . 
 these errors are given by @xcite _ l^xy & = & + & & ^1/2 . 
 [ eq : sigmas ] here @xmath46 denotes the fraction of the sky covered by the experiment . 
 this factor accounts for the smaller number of independent samples achieved when covering only parts of the sky . for a full - sky experiment like planck , 
 this factor is the part of the sky actually used in the analysis after the galaxy cut has been made.the fraction of the sky that is scanned by the experiment is denoted @xmath47 . 
 it appears multiplying @xmath48 because a smaller scanned sky fraction means longer integration time per pixel . 
 partial - sky experiments will of course aim to avoid the troublesome galaxy plane in their scanning strategy , making @xmath49 for such experiments .    a convenient notation to describe the noise in a pixel independent way is @xmath50 @xcite . 
 here @xmath51 is the angular pixel size , @xmath52 is the time used observing each pixel and @xmath53 is the total number of pixels . 
 the detector sensitivity is denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55k is the average sky temperature . 
 we have @xmath56 for @xmath57 @xcite . 
 for @xmath58 we have w_xx^-1 = 2.14 10 ^ -15 t_^-1 ( ) ^2 [ eq : winv ] , where @xmath59 is the observing time in years . from now on 
 we denote @xmath60 and @xmath61 . 
 for bolometric experiments the polarization detectors will observe only the @xmath9 or @xmath10 stokes parameter at a time , leading to @xmath62 .    in eq . 
 ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) @xmath63 is the assumed gaussian experimental beam , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the beam width , @xmath66 . 
 the @xmath67s appearing in ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) are given in dimensionless @xmath68 units . when estimating parameter errors from the @xmath3 power spectrum , we use @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 in eqn . 
 ( [ eq : sigmaf ] ) , since the @xmath3 power spectrum scales as @xmath39 .      in the procedure described above , 
 we have neglected all effects from foregrounds . 
 how much the foregrounds will affect the obtained limits on the magnetic field strength will depend on the specific experiments used , our understanding of the statistical properties of the different foregrounds , and whether a significant proportion of the foregrounds has been successfully subtracted from the cmb maps before the parameter analysis is performed . to do a proper analysis of all the involved foreground effects 
 is outside the scope of this work . 
 however , we will use a simple foreground model to estimate the possible effects of foregrounds on our results .    at the frequencies relevant here ( @xmath71ghz ) , the synchrotron emission from our galaxy is the dominant source of polarized foregrounds @xcite . for frequencies of order 100ghz 
 the polarized emission from vibrating dust will also contribute . in the following analysis 
 we will only include these two foreground components . 
 we will then simply add the foreground signal to the cmb signal in eq . 
 ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) such that c_l^xy = c_l , cmb^xy + c_l , sync^xy + c_l , dust^xy , where @xmath72 is the cmb signal and @xmath73 and @xmath74 come from the synchrotron and dust foregrounds , respectively . for both the foreground components we will assume a simple power law dependence @xcite : c^xy_l,\ { } = ( pa)^2 l^- [ eq : foregrounds ] where @xmath75 is the amplitude of the unpolarized radiation and @xmath76 is the fractional amplitude of the polarized components and @xmath77 is a constant describing the scale - dependence . 
 the numerical values of @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath76 for our dust and synchrotron foreground models are taken from @xcite and quoted in table [ tab : foregrounds ] . 
 .numerical values for the foreground parameters in equation ( [ eq : foregrounds ] ) for synchrotron and dust emission . here 
 [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     let us first concentrate on the results obtained without the foreground model . 
 we can identify which power spectrum gives the best results depends on the experiment under consideration . that @xmath1 is less important for quiet than for e.g. planck is easily understood by the fact that quiet has much better @xmath79 relative to @xmath80 than the bolometer based experiments . 
 but we have also seen that the results from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 power spectra depend more strongly on @xmath79 and @xmath80 than does the @xmath1 power spectrum . 
 this explains e.g. why we for planck find the best limits from using @xmath1 , while the best limits come from @xmath2 for clover . 
 the most impressive results come from the quiet experiment s phase 2 telescopes . here 
 the eb power spectrum can constrain @xmath0 by @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the 2 m and 7 m telescopes , respectively . 
 this is approximately a factor 50 better than what we find for planck @xmath1 and spider , a factor 20 better than ebex and about a factor 5 better than clover and quijote .    adding the foreground model , this picture changes significantly . 
 the results from quiet p2 now weakens by more than an order of magnitude , while the changes for the other experiments are typically by @xmath83 . 
 the reason why quiet is much more sensitive to this foreground is caused by several factors . 
 firstly , the quiet experiment covers a small fraction of the sky , and we have seen that while this can be beneficial in a foreground - free scenario , the opposite is the case when the foreground is present . also , quiet operates at a relative low frequency compared to for example clover and ebex , which makes the synchrotron foreground much stronger , as its amplitude has a @xmath84 dependence . 
 we have also seen that the effect of having good experimental sensitivity is less important in the presence of foregrounds . 
 the result is that when including the foreground model , we find the best results from clover @xmath2 , giving @xmath85gauss , which is a factor 3 better than what we find for quiet , a factor 6 better than ebex and an order of magnitude better than planck .    which of the results with or without the foreground are more close to the real performance of the experiments depends on how well the foreground can be subtracted from the maps . 
 this will be of special importance for quiet and less important for the other experiments considered here . 
 also , we have assumed perfect knowledge of the statistical properties of the foreground model . 
 when analyzing a real experiment , these uncertainties must be taken into account and this may alter the results , especially for a `` foreground sensitive '' experiment like quiet . 
 we also note that the results in table [ tab : results ] are quoted for each individual power spectrum . 
 simply combining the results from the different power spectra ( and experiments ) will of course improve the limits slightly . 
 in this work we have calculated cmb power spectra for a universe with a primordial , homogeneous magnetic field . 
 we introduced a simple foreground model , and applied a fisher matrix approach to explore how the experimental sensitivity to such a magnetic field depended on different experimental parameters . 
 we then attempted to forecast our ability to constrain @xmath86 for various future cmb polarization experiments . 
 in our foreground model we have assumed perfect knowledge of the statistical behavior of the foregrounds , but that none of it has been removed from the cmb maps prior to the parameter analysis . 
 we argue that this can be regarded as a conservative approach . including this foreground model we find that among the experiments considered here , clover has the best prospects of constraining @xmath0 , and we find @xmath87gauss in this case . when assuming that all foregrounds are perfectly subtracted from the maps , we find quiet to be the most promising experiment , giving @xmath88gauss . 
 this is two orders of magnitude better than the present upper limits on @xmath0 from using the homogeneous anisotropy of cmb @xcite . for the quiet experiment , 
 the results rely heavily on the ability to successfully subtract the foregrounds , while the other experiments under consideration are less dependent on this .    to conclude 
 , our study shows that we will be able to significantly improve our knowledge of possible primordial homogenous magnetic fields in the coming years . 
 a positive detection will impact both the construction of inflationary models and our understanding of the origins of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters .

55,"hr8844 currently assigned an a0v spectral type , is one of the 47 northern slowly rotating early - a stars studied by @xcite . 
 this star has been little studied : only 32 references can be found in ads although it is fairly bright ( v=5.89 ) . 
 the low projected rotational velocity of hr8844 can either be due to i ) a very low inclination angle ( @xmath0 ) or ii ) a very low equatorial velocity @xmath1 . in this second case 
 , the star could develop large over and underabundances and be a new chemically peculiar ( cp ) star . 
 we have recently synthesized several lines of 41 elements present in the sophie spectrum of hr8844 using model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis including hyperfine structure of various isotopes when necessary . 
 these synthetic spectra were iteratively adjusted to the archival high resolution high signal - to - noise spectrum of hr8844 in order to derive the abundances of these elements . this abundance analysis yields underabundances of the light elements ( he , c , n and o ) and overabundances of the iron - peak elements and of the very heavy elements ( vhe whose atomic number z is greater than 30 ) . 
 this definitely shows that hr884 should be reclassified as a new cp star . 
 we present here preliminary determinations of the elemental abundances in hr8844 . 
 hd 30085 has been observed at the observatoire de haute provence using the high resolution ( r = 75000 ) mode of sophie in august 2009 . 
 one 10 minutes exposures was secured with a @xmath2 ratio of about 269 . 
 we did not observe hr8844 ourselves but fetched the spectrum from the sophie archive . 
 the effective temperature and surface gravity of hr8844 were first evaluated using napiwotzky et al s ( 1993 ) uvbybeta calibration of stromgren s photometry . 
 the found effective temperature @xmath3 is 9750 @xmath4 200 k and the surface gravity @xmath5 is 3.80 @xmath4 0.25 dex . 
 a plane parallel model atmosphere assuming radiative equilibrium , hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamical equilibrium has been first computed using the atlas9 code @xcite , specifically the linux version using the new odfs maintained by f. castelli on her website . 
 the linelist was built starting from kurucz s ( 1992 ) gfhyperall.dat file which includes hyperfine splitting levels . 
 this first linelist was then upgraded using the nist atomic spectra database and the vald database operated at uppsala university @xcite . 
 a grid of synthetic spectra was then computed with synspec48 @xcite to model the lines . 
 the synthetic spectrum was then convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile and a parabolic rotation profile using the routine rotin3 provided along with synspec48 . 
 we adopted a projected apparent rotational velocity @xmath6 km.s@xmath7 and a radial velocity @xmath8 km.s@xmath7 from @xcite . 
 the derived abundances for the 41 elements studied are displayed in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] . for a given element 
 , we display actually the difference of the abundance in hr8844 relative to the solar value . 
 a null value therefore means a solar abundance , a negative value an underabundance and a positive value an overabundance for that element in hr8844 . 
 we have depicted 2 horizontal lines at @xmath4 0.15 dex of the null values to display a representative error bar . 
 any abundance situated above or below these lines represent real over or underabundances . 
 we find that hr8844 displays underabundances in the light elements he , c , o , mg , ca , sc , ti and ni . 
 it has solar abundances for n , al , si , s and fe and only mild overabundances for v , cr , mn . 
 it has large overabundances in several very heavy elements : sr , y , zr , ba , la , ce , pr , nd , sm , eu , tb , dy , er , ho , pt and hg . 
 the heaviest elements pt and hg seem to be the most overabundant however their abundance determinations should be taken with caution as they rely on one line only for each element . 
 the abundance pattern of hr8844 somehow resembles that of the hot am stars , sirius a and hd72660 which have effective temperatures and surface gravities very close to that of hr8844 . 
 however much work remains to be done to establish the differences and similarities of surface composition in these three stars . 
 the derived abundance pattern of hr8844 strongly departs from the solar composition which definitely shows that hr8844 is not a superficially normal early a star but is actually another new cp star . 
 we have already reported on the discovery of 5 new cp stars of the hgmn type in @xcite and @xcite . 
 hr8844 has overabundances of both the rare earths and possibly of the vhe hg and pt and therefore resembles both a very hot am star and a very cool hgmn star . 
 it could be a hybrid object intermediate between these two classes of objects . 
 we are currently planning more observations of hr8844 with sophie in order to complement the abundances derived here and search for line variability . 
 this will help us adddress the relationship of hr8844 to the 2 other hot am stars , sirius a and hd72660 and constrain the nature of this interesting new cp star .

56,"in a seminal paper seidel & suen  @xcite found that there exist non - singular , time - dependent equilibrium configurations of self - gravitating real scalar fields . 
 these oscillating soliton stars are called _ oscillatons _ , and are solutions of the einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) system of equations for minimally coupled real scalar fields . 
 the time - dependence of these solutions appears as a fundamental ingredient that allows singularities to be avoided , in contrast to static solutions of the ekg equations with real scalar fields , where singularities frequently appear . 
 the case of real scalar fields is quite different to the case of complex scalar fields , for which the ekg equations provide the so - called boson stars , which are non - singular solitonic solution with a static geometry ( the components of the complex field oscillate in precisely such a way that the stress - energy tensor is time independent ) . 
 however , the stability of oscillatons has not been studied in as much detail as in the case of boson stars  @xcite . 
 such studies are necessary because of the possible role of oscillatons in astrophysics and cosmology , where real scalar fields have been proposed as candidates for the dark matter in the universe  @xcite .    in this paper we want to complement previous studies  @xcite on oscillatons with a numerical analysis of the evolution of the ekg equations , much in the same way as it has been done for boson stars  @xcite . 
 the main aim is to investigate whether oscillatons are stable . for simplicity 
 , we only consider here the spherically symmetric case of a real scalar field @xmath0 endowed with a quadratic scalar potential of the form . 
 other cases will be treated in future publications . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ two ] , we present the necessary mathematical background to find equilibrium configurations and to further evolve the ekg equations . 
 as we shall see , the equilibrium configurations may be classified in two different groups : the s and u - branches . 
 the numerical methods and tests are presented in section  [ three ] . in sections  [ four ] and [ five ] , 
 we analyze the results obtained from the evolution of the ekg equations for different oscillatons . 
 we separately study the behavior of s and u - oscillatons by adding to them small and strong perturbations that change their total mass . we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] . 
 to begin with , we consider the spherically symmetric line element @xmath1    with @xmath2 the lapse function and @xmath3 the radial metric function . 
 we choose the polar - areal slicing condition ( i.e. we force the line element to have the above form at all times , so that the area of a sphere with @xmath4 is always equal to @xmath5 ) ; this choice of gauge will force the lapse function @xmath2 to satisfy an ordinary differential equation in @xmath6 . through 
 out the work , we will be using units such that @xmath7 , and we express the gravitational constant in terms of he planck mass : @xmath8 . 
 the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field @xmath0 endowed with a quadratic self - interaction potential is @xmath9 \ , . 
 \label{tensor}\ ] ]    the non - vanishing components of @xmath10 are @xmath11 \ ; , \label{tensor1 } \\ 
 t_{01 } & = & { \mathcal p}_{\phi } = \dot{\phi } \phi^\prime \ ; , \label{tensor2 } \\ { t^1}_1 & = & p_r = \frac{1}{2 } \left [ \alpha^{-2 } { \dot{\phi}}^2 + a^{-2 } \phi^{\prime 2 } - m^2 \phi^2 \right ] \ ; , \label{tensor3 } \\ { t^2}_2 & = & p_\bot = \frac{1}{2 } \left [ \alpha^{-2 } { \dot{\phi}}^2 - a^{-2 } \phi^{\prime 2 } - m^2 \phi^2 \right ] \ ; , \label{tensor4}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    and also @xmath12 . 
 these different components are identified as the energy density @xmath13 , the momentum density @xmath14 , the radial pressure @xmath15 , and the angular pressure @xmath16 . 
 the parameter @xmath17 is interpreted as the mass of the scalar particles . over - dots 
 denote @xmath18 and primes denote @xmath19 . 
 the evolution of the metric functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be obtained from the einstein equations @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . in order to write appropriate evolution equations , we now introduce the first order variables @xmath24 and . also , we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath25 , where we note that the bosonic mass is the natural scale for time and distance .    using these new variables 
 , the hamiltonian constraint becomes @xmath26 \ , , \label{ham}\ ] ] and the polar - areal slicing condition takes the form @xmath27    the evolution of the scalar field @xmath0 is governed by the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation , which appears as a consequence of the conservation equations of the scalar field energy - momentum tensor  ( [ tensor ] ) in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dalambertian operator . 
 the kg equation is equivalent to the following set of first order differential equations @xmath30    equations ( [ ham]-[kg3 ] ) form the complete set of differential equations to be solved numerically . 
 the evolution equation for @xmath31 above is further transformed into the equivalent form : @xmath32 notice that the first term on the right hand side of this equation includes now a first derivative with respect to @xmath33 ( and not a third derivative ) . 
 the reason for doing this transformation has to do with the numerical regularization near the origin of the @xmath34 factor in equation  ( [ kg2 ] ) above ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) .      in order to find the equilibrium configurations of oscillatons , eqs . 
 ( [ ham]-[kg3 ] ) are solved using fourier expansions for both the metric and the scalar field functions  @xcite . 
 we briefly describe here the procedure used in  @xcite to find such equilibrium configurations .    in order to deal with the non - linearities present in the ekg equations , it is convenient to introduce the new variables @xmath35 , for which eqs . 
 ( [ ham]-[kg3 ] ) take the form @xmath36 \ , , \label{a3 } \\ c \ddot{\phi } & = & - \frac{1}{2}\dot{c } \dot{\phi } + \phi^{\prime \prime } + \phi^\prime \left(\frac{2}{x}- \frac{c^{\prime}}{2 c } \right ) - a \phi \ , , \label{akg } \\ 
 \dot{a } & = & x a \dot{\phi } \phi^\prime \ , . 
 \label{a1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the lapse function is later obtained as @xmath37 . 
 notice that eq . 
 ( [ a1 ] ) is a consequence of the momentum constraint ( the @xmath38 part of the einstein equations . ) 
 we shall consider the fourier expansions @xmath39 where @xmath40 is called the fundamental frequency and @xmath41 is the mode at which the fourier series are truncated . 
 solutions are obtained by introducing the fourier expansions  ( [ fexp ] ) in eqs . 
 ( [ a2]-[a1 ] ) , and setting each fourier coefficient to zero ; that is , the ekg equations are reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations . 
 the boundary conditions are determined by requiring non - singular and asymptotically flat solutions , for which equations  ( [ a2]-[a1 ] ) become an eigenvalue problem . 
 thus , it is only necessary to determine the initial values @xmath42 ( the fundamental frequency is an _ output _ 
 value ) corresponding to a given central central value @xmath43 , to obtain different equilibrium configurations . 
 a typical oscillaton solution is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : phi_s ] . 
 even though we are solving non - linear equations , the fourier series converges rapidly . 
 a particular feature of the solutions is that they are represented only by odd fourier coefficients of the scalar field @xmath0 and the even coefficients of the metric functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in fig . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] , we show the calculated total mass ( @xmath46 ) , the fundamental frequency ( @xmath47 ) and the radius at which the radial metric coefficient reaches its maximum value at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) for different configurations . in the case of oscillatons , 
 the position of the maximum of @xmath50 is not a fixed value but instead oscillates in time . 
 however , as we shall see below ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : mvsr_ec ] ) , the amplitude of such oscillations is quite small and the initial value can be taken as representative of each oscillaton . 
 the maximum mass @xmath51 is reached for a central value @xmath52 , to which also corresponds a fundamental frequency @xmath53 . 
 the fundamental frequency is always such that @xmath54 for all oscillatons , with @xmath55 for the trivial solution . in general , 
 more massive oscillatons oscillate with a smaller fundamental frequency . 
 in order to integrate the klein - gordon equations  ( [ kg1],[kg2],[kg3 ] ) we used a method of lines with second order centered differences in space . for the time integration 
 we use a method inspired in the iterative crank nicholson ( icn ) scheme with three iterations ( see for example  @xcite ) . 
 the standard icn is used to integrate a system of evolution equations of the form : @xmath56 given values of the variables @xmath57 at time step @xmath58 , one updates the values of the variables to time step @xmath59 in the following way :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are intermediate values . 
 taking @xmath64 is enough to obtain a second order accurate , stable scheme  @xcite ( in fact , taking @xmath65 is enough for second order accuracy , but it is unstable ) .    for our purposes we have modified the above algorithm for the case @xmath64 in the following way : @xmath66 the reason for this modification is that the above scheme is considerably less dissipative than standard three - step icn . in fact , for linear equations one can show that the above scheme is third order in time . 
 we have found our modified scheme icn to be very stable and robust in practice . 
 once we have advanced the variables @xmath0 , @xmath67 and @xmath31 one time step using the above algorithm , we substitute their new values into equations  ( [ ham ] ) and  ( [ slice ] ) . 
 these are simple ordinary differential equations on the radial coordinate that we solve using a standard second order runge - kutta scheme . 
 our set of equations is singular at @xmath68 . to avoid the singularity , 
 we stagger the origin and take a spatial grid of the form . the fictitious point at @xmath69 
 is used to impose appropriate parity conditions : @xmath31 is even and @xmath67 is odd . 
 notice that we can integrate @xmath0 all the way to the boundary point @xmath70 , since its evolution equation does not require the evaluation of spatial derivatives . 
 at the outer boundary we also need to impose boundary conditions . 
 notice again that we do not need to apply a boundary condition for @xmath0 , as its evolution equation can be integrated all the way to the boundary point . 
 for @xmath31 we assume that , for large enough @xmath71 , it behaves as an outgoing wave pulse of the form : @xmath72 with @xmath73 an arbitrary function . in differential form 
 this becomes @xmath74 which , performing finite difference can be solved for the unknown boundary value at the new time level . on the other hand , 
 it is not difficult to convince oneself that the function @xmath67 does not behave as an outgoing wave at the boundary . 
 however , we are assuming that @xmath31 does and , as a consequence , so does @xmath0 . 
 in particular , the outgoing wave boundary condition applied to @xmath0 can be seen to imply that at the boundary : @xmath75 this equation can then be used to obtain boundary values for @xmath67 once those of @xmath0 and @xmath31 are known . 
 finally , we need to mention the boundary conditions used for the ordinary differential equations that have to be solved to find the metric functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for @xmath21 , we use the fact that local flatness implies that @xmath76 and @xmath77 . 
 these two conditions imply that @xmath78 . 
 we use these two boundary values at the first two grid points and integrate the second order hamiltonian constraint outwards .    for the lapse function 
 @xmath20 we use the fact that , on a vacuum , our slicing condition implies that we are in schwarzschild coordinates , so we must have @xmath79 . 
 we then assume that our boundaries are sufficiently far away as to be always in a vacuum , and impose @xmath79 as an outer boundary condition . 
 the slicing condition is then integrated inwards . 
 one could presumably improve on this by setting @xmath80 , @xmath81 as boundary conditions on the origin , integrating the slicing condition outwards , and then re - scaling it so that the lapse goes as @xmath82 far away ( @xmath83 is a constant ; notice that the slicing condition is scale invariant ) .      in order to illustrate how all these ingredients work together properly , we study now the accuracy of our numerical methods in some particular cases . in figure 
 [ fig : convergence ] we show the convergence of a system initially consisting of a gaussian pulse of scalar field . 
 the equation we use to calibrate our techniques is the @xmath84 component of the einstein s equations ( the momentum constraint ) : @xmath85 which should be satisfied for an exact solution and the hamiltonian constraint was monitored to calibrate the accuracy of the numerical methods . in this manuscript 
 we have decided to do the opposite ] . 
 what we show in the plot is the @xmath86 norm of the value of @xmath87 across the grid as a function of time for three different resolutions . 
 the initial gaussian corresponds to an oscillaton with @xmath88 , so that it is in the stable branch and has a long time life ; the boundary is located at @xmath89 so that the evolutions were carried out up to 100 crossing times . 
 the fact that the value of @xmath87 goes down by a factor of 4 every time the resolution is doubled shows that the code remains second order convergent . 
 we shall call s - branch oscillatons those equilibrium configurations to the _ left _ hand side of the critical configuration in the plot @xmath90 in fig . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] ( or equivalently , those configurations to the _ right _ hand side in the plot of @xmath91 ) . as a first step in the study of the stability of oscillatons 
 , we will numerically evolve these equilibrium configurations . 
 we should keep in mind that , compared to realistic oscillatons , the solutions presented in fig . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] are already perturbed . 
 these perturbations arise because of the inherent discretization error of the numerical solutions and ( mainly ) of the truncated fourier expansions . 
 therefore , the eigen - solutions of section  [ two : i ] will be treated as already _ slightly perturbed _ 
 profiles@xcite . 
 the main results presented in this section can be summarized as follows . 
 i ) s - oscillatons are stable against _ small _ perturbations . 
 ii ) besides the fundamental oscillations of the system , there is an overall vibration of the oscillaton when slightly perturbed . 
 the frequencies ( @xmath92 ) of these vibrations should be identified with the so - called quasi - normal modes of the system , and the resulting plot @xmath93 is a particular feature of the @xmath94-oscillatons . as we shall see below , such quasi - normal modes are very important in the study of evolved profiles . 
 we take the scalar field profiles obtained by solving eqs . 
 ( [ a1]-[akg ] ) to be the initial data for the evolution equations . in this form , the initial conditions for the scalar field are ( see eqs . 
 ( [ fexp ] ) ) @xmath95 and then the metric functions @xmath96 are calculated through the einstein equations . in this manner 
 , we will also check the consistency between the eigenvalue problem and the numerical evolution since no additional information ( like the metric functions , the fundamental frequency @xmath40 , etc . ) 
 is taken initially .    as a typical example of a s - branch oscillaton 
 , we show in fig . 
 [ fig : a_ec ] the evolution of the initial profile shown in fig . 
 [ fig : phi_s ] , characterized by the central value @xmath97 . from the figure we see that such an oscillaton is stable , maintaining the same oscillatory pattern from @xmath98 ( see fig . 
 [ fig : adot_ec ] ) up to times @xmath99 ( in the plot we are showing only a fraction of the run ) . that the evolution is stable can also be seen from fig . 
 [ fig : adot_ec ] , in which we show the accuracy of the numerical evolution by plotting the momentum constraint . in fig 
 [ fig : mass ] we show the evolution of the total integrated mass . 
 we can see a small appreciable adjustment of the original mass at around @xmath100 , indicating a small ejection of scalar field from the system . 
 the overall linear decay of the mass can be shown to be consistent ( using convergence tests ) with a small amount of numerical dissipation still present in our numerical method , and is therefore not an intrinsic decay of the oscillaton .    . 
 [ fig : adot_ec ]    the simulations show that the evolved profile oscillates periodically at two different time scales . in particular 
 , there is a short - period oscillation , which we may identify with the fundamental oscillation , and an overall vibration with a longer period  @xcite . following the literature of boson stars  @xcite 
 , we shall refer to the later as the `` quasi - normal modes '' .    to determine the oscillatory scales of the solution , we calculated the power spectrum of the evolution of @xmath101 in fig . 
 [ fig : a_ec ] , and plotted it in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] . 
 notice that the dominant frequencies are the quasi - normal one and ( twice ) the fundamental angular frequency , which are , respectively , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . 
 higher modes corresponding to even - multiples of the fundamental frequency are also present , but their power is smaller . observe that the fundamental frequency is a little bit readjusted too , but its value is consistent with the eigen - solution in fig . 
 [ fig : phi_s ] . 
 we systematically evolve all other s - branch equilibrium configurations shown in figs . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] , calculating their corresponding power spectrum and then their quasi - normal and fundamental frequencies . in all cases 
 , the evolved profiles behaved accordingly with the description given above for the ( representative ) case @xmath97 . 
 for instance , the values of the fundamental frequencies were just a little bit readjusted in all cases , but its values were always consistent with those shown in figs .  [ 
 fig : mass_s ] . in general , the power spectrum of more dilute oscillatons is dominated by the fundamental frequency , while the quasi - normal frequency dominates for oscillatons near the critical point . also , the linear numerical dissipation of mass was as in fig . 
 [ fig : adot_ec ] , suggesting also that it should be attributed to the numerical method and not to the intrinsic properties of oscillatons .    the resulting plot @xmath104 in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] has been very useful to analyze the evolution of boson stars@xcite , and we will see it is useful for oscillatons as well . the plot shows a maximum and a sharp decline near the critical mass . 
 this is a typical behavior indicating the transition from stable to unstable configurations . 
 to further demonstrate that the s - oscillatons are stable and that the frequencies shown in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] are their intrinsic quasi - normal modes , we show in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_ec ] the evolution of the total mass @xmath46 and @xmath105 compared to the equilibrium configurations as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] . 
 it is clear that the slightly perturbed s - oscillatons oscillate with very small amplitudes around the original equilibrium configurations . in other words , they are not migrating to other oscillatons nor decaying . 
 this can be compared to the migrating oscillatons shown in figs . 
 [ fig : mvsr_sp],[fig : mvsr],[fig : mvsr_up ] below . 
 the results presented above give evidence for the points ( i - ii ) outlined at the beginning of this section . 
 we would like to stress here that the important result is that there do exist stable oscillatons ( at least in the s - branch ) . 
 as a side - effect , we have also proven the consistency between the eigenvalue problem and the numerical evolution code . 
 our interest now is to determine whether s - branch oscillatons are stable against _ 
 strong _ perturbations . 
 that is , we want to know the conditions under which such oscillatons will either collapse into a black hole , disperse away or form another oscillaton . 
 the latter is a rather interesting possibility since , as we shall show below , it implies the migration of oscillatons . 
 we have included gaussian - like perturbations in the original equilibrium configurations , like that shown in fig . 
 [ fig : gauss ] , which can be seen just as perturbations to the original mass of the oscillatons . 
 ( we shall call _ original _ the profiles shown in figs .  [ 
 fig : mass_s ] and their corresponding parameters ) . 
 the main results are summarized as follows . 
 iii ) if an oscillaton is perturbed in such a way that its mass is less than the critical mass @xmath106,% lower than the one determined from the eigenvalue problem in section  [ two : i ] . see also section  [ five : ii ] . ] 
 it migrates to another solution in the s - branch . 
 iv ) on the other hand , if the initial mass is larger than @xmath107 , the oscillaton can either migrate to an s - oscillaton or collapse to a black hole . 
 the collapse to a black hole can be prevented by the oscillaton ejecting the mass excess , the so - called gravitational cooling mechanism  @xcite . 
 this mechanism is highly effective for dilute oscillatons . in both cases ( iii , iv ) above 
 , the evolution of the perturbed profiles can be tracked according to their vibration frequencies , i.e. , the quasi - normal modes . 
 we have plotted some typical evolutions of perturbed s - branch oscillatons in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_sp ] which show the different behaviors described above . 
 we start by discussing point ( iii ) . in the first case 
 , we decreased the initial mass of a @xmath108-oscillaton to an initial value @xmath109 ( @xmath110% less than its original mass @xmath111 ) . 
 we can observe that initially the oscillaton expands and then bounces back while it looses mass , to finally settle down on the s - branch . 
 the migration is manifest in the trajectory shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_sp ] , that oscillates around the stable equilibrium configurations discussed in the previous section . during the evolution , 
 the oscillaton maintains a fixed vibration frequency . 
 its path of migration is labelled a in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] , and shows that the oscillaton will stop at a diluted one . 
 a second case corresponds to a @xmath112-oscillaton which was strongly perturbed as to have an initial mass of @xmath113 ( @xmath114% over its original mass @xmath115 ) . despite the strong perturbation , 
 the oscillaton collapses and looses enough mass to settle down onto another s - oscillaton . by measuring the vibration frequency 
 , we find that the migrating oscillaton follows the path labelled b in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] , which suggests that the oscillaton is migrating to a @xmath116-like profile . 
 this can also be seen in fig . 
 [ fig:1m15 ] , in which the profile of the metric coefficient @xmath117 rapidly approaches and oscillates around the final configuration .    to illustrate point ( iv ) , a @xmath112-oscillaton 
 was perturbed to have an initial mass of @xmath118 , a value larger than the critical one . 
 however , we can observe that the oscillaton rapidly loses mass and migrates back to the s - branch . 
 its migration path is labeled c in fig .  [ 
 fig : freq ] . 
 this is a typical example of the efficiency of the gravitational cooling mechanism in enough dilute oscillatons . 
 the opposite case is shown by a perturbed @xmath119-oscillaton , whose initial mass is @xmath120 . 
 the gravitational cooling mechanism is not efficient enough in this case to prevent the formation of a black hole . 
 we see this by noticing that its trajectory stops at the value of @xmath105 corresponding to the schwarzschild radius of the hole . 
 however , we have observed that the same oscillaton does migrate to the s - branch if the initial mass is somewhat less perturbed , while still being larger than the critical one . 
 this is also a generic phenomenon we have observed by perturbing other s - oscillatons . 
 this tells us that the gravitational cooling mechanism is highly efficient if the scalar field is diluted enough , like in the cases shown in the original paper of seidel & suen  @xcite . 
 the results presented so far point out that , apart from being stable configurations , s - branch oscillatons are indeed the final states in the evolution of other perturbed s - oscillatons . these two properties ( stability and final state - quality ) are the imprint of s - oscillatons . to end this section 
 , we would like to stress here the important role of the quasi - normal modes to follow the migration process of oscillatons . 
 the examples presented so far show that the vibration frequency of the system remains the same during its evolution , even while the system looses mass . 
 we shall call u - branch oscillatons those equilibrium configurations on the right ( left ) hand side of the critical configuration in the plot @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) in fig . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] . 
 we also evolved these equilibrium configurations , under the same idea that the eigen - solutions of section  [ two : i ] are already slightly perturbed configurations . 
 the main result of this section is that u - oscillatons are intrinsically unstable since , as we shall see below , they decay and migrate to the s - branch under _ small _ perturbations .    shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr ] are some instances of slightly perturbed u - oscillatons , and the plot @xmath122 speaks by itself when compared to fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_ec ] . 
 the u - branch oscillatons are intrinsically unstable ; they migrate to and settle down onto the s - branch , even under small perturbations . 
 the larger the central value ( @xmath123 ) , the more unstable they are . 
 their migration to the s - branch also confirms the stability of the s - oscillatons and their important role as the final states in the evolution of migrating oscillatons . 
 as we have done before , the migration of oscillatons can be tracked by determining their quasi - normal frequencies . 
 for example , the slightly perturbed @xmath124-oscillatons shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr ] are labeled d , e , respectively , in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] . 
 we have also perturbed the u - branch equilibrium configurations and studied whether they migrate or collapse into black holes . 
 the main results of this section are as follows . 
 i ) if the initial mass somewhat larger than the original mass of the eigen - configuration , the oscillaton collapses into a black hole . 
 this result is independent of the kind of perturbation made and then it can be characterized by the excess in mass only . 
 ii ) if the mass of the original configuration is decreased by the perturbation , the oscillaton migrates to the s - branch . 
 the @xmath125-oscillaton is a typical example of u - oscillaton and its evolution under strong perturbations is plotted in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_up ] . 
 if the initial mass of this oscillaton is perturbed so that is @xmath126% more massive that the original mass , the final stage of the collapse is a black hole , even though the initial mass is less than the critical value . 
 this can also be seen in fig . 
 [ fig : bh ] , where we see plots of the metric coefficients @xmath127 and @xmath117 . the coefficient @xmath127 shows the well - know `` collapse of the lapse '' ( the lapse drops to zero ) characteristic of black holes , while the coefficient @xmath117 shows the `` grid stretching '' effect ( te radial metric grows exponentially ) , also typical of black hole evolutions . on the other hand , 
 if the initial mass of the same oscillaton is @xmath126% less than the original mass , the oscillaton rapidly migrates to the s - branch and settles down into a stable oscillaton . 
 its evolution path in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] ( label f ) , overlaps with that of the migrating s - oscillaton shown in fig . 
 [ fig : gauss],[fig:1m15 ] ( label b in fig . 
 [ fig : freq ] ) . 
 thus , the final state of the evolution seems to be a @xmath116-oscillaton , as can also be seen in fig . 
 [ fig:8m15 ] . 
 this last fact reveals again the usefulness of the plot @xmath93 to determine the final configuration of a migrating oscillaton . 
 we would like to summarize here the results presented so far . 
 we have found that the imprint of u - branch oscillatons is that they are intrinsically unstable . 
 that is , even small perturbations provoke their migration to other configurations , instead of the small oscillations around the original ones . 
 this latter fact again confirms the stability and final state - status of s - oscillatons . 
 another particular characteristic of u - oscillatons is that the formation of a black hole is very likely if the original profile is perturbed by adding mass to it . 
 this phenomenon occurs even if the perturbed initial mass is less than the critical one , so that the gravitational cooling mechanism is not efficient at all in the u - branch . 
 now we take a closer look at the equilibrium configurations near the critical profile , the one being the most massive in figs . 
 [ fig : mass_s ] , which we shall call the s - u transition point .    to begin with , 
 let us recall the basic characteristics of the s , u - branches . 
 the basic imprint of s - branch oscillatons is that they are stable and then oscillate around the initial profiles when slightly perturbed , see fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_ec ] . on the other hand , 
 u - branch oscillatons are intrinsically unstable and they migrate to the s - branch even when slightly perturbed , like those cases shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr ] .    the evolution of the profiles near the s - u transition point when slightly perturbed are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mvsr_su ] . 
 we observe that the results summarized above are again confirmed , and then the critical configuration characterizes the transition between the s and u branches under _ small _ perturbations . 
 we have also found the same results in the case of strong perturbations . 
 if the mass of these oscillatons is decreased , they migrate to s - oscillatons . 
 if the mass is increased even by a small amount , they collapse rapidly forming black holes . 
 that u - oscillatons form black holes is not surprising . 
 the fact that s - oscillatons can also collapse to black holes near the critical point is a consequence of the inefficiency of the gravitational cooling mechanism in the case of dense s - oscillatons , as it was found in section  [ four : i ] . 
 actually , if the mass of an s - oscillaton near the transition point is perturbed to be larger than @xmath128 , it will collapse into black holes ; otherwise , it will migrate to more diluted configurations . 
 that is , the value @xmath129 can be seen as the true critical value in the s - u transition region . 
 thus , we can conclude that the critical oscillaton ( @xmath130 ) marks the transition from the s - branch to the u - branch . 
 in this paper , we have studied the properties of oscillatons by numerically evolving the einstein - klein - gordon equations . according to the results 
 , oscillatons can be classified into two well definite groups , the s and u - branches . 
 s - branch oscillatons are stable equilibrium configurations , which oscillate according to their fundamental and intrinsic frequency ( @xmath40 ) . when slightly perturbed , these oscillatons vibrate with definite frequencies which we have identified as the frequencies ( @xmath92 ) of their particular quasi - normal modes . 
 this is supported by the fact that these vibrations are small - amplitude oscillations around the equilibrium configurations . 
 if these oscillatons are strongly perturbed such that their original mass is decreased , they migrate to and settle down onto other s - branch oscillatons . 
 this fact points out that s - oscillatons should be seen as final states to which other scalar configurations migrate to .    on the other hand 
 , we have found that s - oscillatons do not , in general , collapse into black holes if their mass is increased by the perturbation . even though we have found that oscillatons with high - central densities form black holes if their mass is larger than the critical value @xmath129 , diluted oscillatons can avoid such fate by means of the gravitational cooling mechanism . 
 the later can be so efficient that strongly perturbed oscillatons can migrate to stable configurations , even if their initial mass was much larger than the critical value . 
 the evolutions of the u - branch oscillatons consistently show that they are intrinsically unstable configurations . even under small perturbations 
 , they migrate to the s - branch . 
 this migration also appears when they are strongly perturbed in such a way that their original mass is decreased . 
 however , another manifestation of their unstable nature is that they rapidly collapse into black holes if their mass is increased , even by small amounts and even if the initial mass is well below the critical value .    in all cases of migrating oscillatons 
 , we found that their evolution can be followed by measuring their vibration frequency , and this can be used to predict to which configuration the perturbed oscillatons will migrate to .    through this paper 
 , we have studied oscillatons with a quadratic scalar potential for simplicity . 
 however , we have already initiated similar studies to include a self - interaction in the potential and they are work in progress to appear elsewhere .

57,"the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become a powerful cosmological tool with applications in various astrophysical scenarios . 
 recently , the wmap team has determined the main cosmological parameters from the cmb temperature field with unprecedented accuracy @xcite . 
 this temperature field is composed of primordial anisotropies , generated at the last scattering surface , and secondary fluctuations , which arise as the cmb photons travel to the observer . among these secondary anisotropies , we shall concentrate on the so called thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( hereafter tsz , @xcite ) , associated with the distortion of the black body spectrum of the cmb photons due to compton scattering on fast moving thermal electrons . 
 this spectral distortion is independent of redshift and proportional to the integrated electron pressure along the line of sight . 
 it has been detected in the direction of several galaxy clusters @xcite . 
 this makes the tsz effect an useful tool for the detection of ionized hot gas . 
 recently , @xcite have argued that about 90% of all baryons are in the form of intergalactic plasma , not dense and hot enough to be detectable as x - ray sources except in clusters and groups of galaxies . at low redshfits , 30% of all baryons could be in the form of ly-@xmath4 absorbers @xcite , but a large fraction of them has not yet been accounted for observationally . 
 most models of structure formation predict baryons to be located in filaments and sheets , associated to galaxy overdensities @xcite . 
 @xcite show evidence of filamentary x - ray emission at the core of the shapley supercluster , whereas @xcite report a detection of diffuse x - ray emission by warm gas ( @xmath5k ) associated with an overdense galaxy region . 
 the aim of this _ letter _ is to use the tsz effect to detect directly the diffuse warm baryon component in the local universe . 
 the analyses of the first year wmap data have indicated that a small contribution due to the tsz induced by clusters is present in the data ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite claimed a tsz detection at small angular scales but did not clarify the nature of the astrophysical sources associated with it . 
 @xcite analysed the angular extension of the tsz signal in the w band of wmap by examining the cmb map in the direction of the largest galaxy groups and clusters found in the catalogues of @xcite ( hereafter aco ) , @xcite ( hereafter apm ) and the 2 micron all sky survey extended source catalogue , @xcite . 
 their analyses showed evidence for diffuse tsz emission up to an angular scale of @xmath6 , which implied a baryon fraction larger than the wmap estimate . 
 if baryons are distributed like the dark matter on scales comparable to the virial radius of galaxies @xcite , the projected density of galaxies on the sky will correlate with the tsz signal , _ independently _ of whether galaxies form clusters , groups or filaments . in this _ 
 , we shall carry out a pixel - to - pixel comparison of wmap w band data with templates constructed from the 2mass galaxy catalogue , to test the distribution of hot gas in the local universe . 
 in sec.2 we describe the pixel to pixel comparison method employed to estimate the tsz signal and the data used in the analysis . in sec.3 
 we present and discuss our results , and we conclude in sec.4 . 
 the brightness temperature measured by a cmb experiment is the sum of different components : cosmological @xmath7 , tsz , instrumental noise @xmath8 and foreground residuals @xmath9 . 
 if the tsz signal is well traced by a known spatial template , denoted here as @xmath10 and built for example from a galaxy catalogue , the total anisotropy at a fixed position on the sky can be modelled as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 measures the amplitude of the template induced signal and @xmath13 denotes the spatial average of the template . 
 if all other components have zero mean and well known correlation functions , then it is possible to use a pixel to pixel comparison to estimate @xmath12 ( see @xcite for details ) . 
 if @xmath14 denotes the correlation matrix of the cmb and noise components ( foregrounds residuals will be discussed later ) then the estimate of @xmath12 and its statistical error are @xmath15 since our galaxy template @xmath10 will be positive by construction , this equation demands that cmb and noise fields have zero mean . 
 we impose the average of all pixels outside the kp0 mask to be zero . 
 we checked that our results were insensitive to this requirement by carrying out a similar analysis usig the more conservative kp2 mask . in all cases our results changed by less than a few percent . 
 notice that our method requires the inversion of the correlation matrix , a computationally expensive procedure . 
 to speed up the process we will carry out the analysis in pixel subsets as described below . 
 we checked with monte carlo simulations that @xmath16 is an unbiased estimator of the error . 
 we centered our analyses on wmap w band , which has the highest angular resolution . in this band , 
 the instrumental noise shows almost no spatial correlation and its position dependent amplitude is determined by the number of observations @xcite . 
 the tsz template was built from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalogue @xcite . 
 this catalogue contains about 1.5 million galaxies , extending up to redshift @xmath17 ( 400 mpc ) , detected in the near - infrared ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands ) . in order to build a tsz template ( @xmath10 ) , 
 all 2mass galaxies were projected onto the sphere using the healpix pixelization @xcite with the same resolution as the cmb data . 
 the amplitude in every pixel was made proportional to the number of galaxies . 
 the template was then convolved with the window function of the noise weighted average beam of the four difference assemblies ( da s ) corresponding to the wmap w band ( clean map ) , and multiplied by the kp0 mask , like the cmb data . since our method requires the cmb and noise components to have zero mean , we substracted the map average outside the kp0 mask . 
 pixels were sorted in sets of size @xmath21 , denoted as @xmath22 , where the superscript index @xmath23 indicates galaxy density , in such a way that low @xmath23 corresponds to higher projected galaxy density . for patches of @xmath242048 , 
 the average projected galaxy density for @xmath251 was @xmath3 420 galaxies per square degree , whereas for @xmath25500 the density dropped to @xmath3 44 galaxies per square degree , which roughly coincides with the average projected density outside the kp0 mask . 
 @xmath21 ranged from 64 to 2048 . 
 the pixel to pixel comparison was then performed on each of these subsets : we compared _ all _ pixels in @xmath22 to their counterparts in the cmb map . 
 our working hypothesis is that galaxies are fair tracers of the gas density and within each set electron temperature is similar , that is , in those pixels galaxies trace the electron pressure . within each subset @xmath26 , 
 the galaxy density remained roughly constant , so our method returned @xmath4 as a weighted mean of the measured temperature in those pixels . 
 if no tsz signal is present , then @xmath4 will scatter around zero , as a consequence of cmb and noise being random fields of zero mean . 
 fig .  ( [ fig : allpxls ] ) summarizes our main results : fig . 
 ( [ fig : allpxls]a ) shows the estimated @xmath4 s for the sets having the highest projected density of galaxies . in abscissas we give the set index ( @xmath23 ) . 
 crosses , filled circles , triangles and diamonds correspond to @xmath24 256 , 512 , 1024 and 2048 , respectively . 
 symbols are slightly shifted for clarity , error bars denote 1@xmath27 confidence levels . at wmap instrumental frequencies , the tsz effect causes temperature decrements , i.e. , template and cmb data should anticorrelate giving negative @xmath4 s , as found . 
 sets 1 and 2 of size @xmath28 correspond to the first set of @xmath29 and similarly for all other sizes and sets . 
 consistently , @xmath4 of a larger set is always bracketed by the @xmath4 s measured from its subsets . 
 the largest signal comes from the densest 256 pixels but the highest statistical level of significance is achieved for @xmath30 ( @xmath31k at the @xmath32 detection level ) , since the error bars shrink due to the higher number of pixels contributing with tsz signal . in fig.([fig : allpxls]b ) the same data sets are plotted versus the average projected galaxy density , i.e. , the average number of galaxies per square degree within each subset , as seen by the w band beam . 
 the symbol coding is identical : first sets of @xmath24 256 , 512 show a projected galaxy density as high as 420380 galaxies per square degree , whereas the 6th set for @xmath24 2048 contains around 140 galaxies per square degree .    in order to evaluate the significance of the previous results , we repeat the analysis for pixels of intermediate and low projected density of galaxies . in fig . 
 ( [ fig : allpxls]c ) diamonds correspond to sets of size @xmath30 with @xmath33 $ ] , whereas filled circles correspond to indices @xmath34 $ ] . 
 the shaded area limits the 1@xmath27 error bar for diamonds , that is about a factor of 1.2 bigger than for filled circles . 
 while the latter scatter around zero with the expected dispersion , diamonds are clearly biased towards negative values : besides the first patch ( @xmath35k ) , there are _ seven _ other sets above the 2@xmath27 level , one of them at @xmath36 . 
 we also tested the consistency of our results with respect to frequency . in fig . 
 ( [ fig : allpxls]d ) we estimate @xmath4 by cross - correlating the densest pixel set ( @xmath30 , @xmath37 ) with all wmap bands : k ( 23ghz ) , ka ( 33ghz ) , q ( 41ghz ) , v(61ghz ) and w(93ghz ) . 
 diamonds give the obtained @xmath4 s from _ raw _ maps , whereas triangles refer to analyses performed on _ foreground cleaned _ maps available in the lambda site . 
 note that the wmap team only provided clean maps for the three highest frequency channels . in all maps , 
 the signal is compatible with being due to tsz . 
 a more quantitative comparison is not straighforward since the maps have different angular resolution and galactic contamination . 
 when compared in pairs , all @xmath4 s are within 1@xmath27 of each other and they are all within 2@xmath27 of the expected frequency dependence of the tsz effect , whose best fit for the cleaned q , v and w band maps is plotted as a solid line . 
 we measure the extent of the tsz regions by rotating the template around the z - axis ( perpendicular to the galactic plane ) and cross - correlating the densest 2048 pixels . in fig . 
 ( [ fig : rottest ] ) squares give @xmath4 versus the average angular displacement of the pixel set . 
 error bars are again 1@xmath27 . 
 the solid line represents the gaussian approximation of the w - band beam . 
 the size of the tsz sources is typically 2030 arcmins , slightly bigger than the beam but remarkably smaller than the values obtained by @xcite from rich aco clusters . 
 actually , when one studies the angular distribution of the 2048 densest pixels , one finds that they are associated in groups of typically 34 members , and that the groups are uniformly distributed on the sky .    by comparing , in fig . 
 ( [ fig : allpxls]d ) , results from the raw and _ cleaned _ maps built from the w band , one can conclude that foregrounds will have little impact on our results . 
 we made a more detailed study using monte carlo simulations : we performed 100 simulations of the cmb and w - band noise components and added and removed a foreground residual template . 
 as a conservative model for foreground residuals left after cleaning the w - band , we took the sum of the dust , free - free and synchrotron emission maps for the w band released by the wmap team . in each simulation 
 we ( i ) added and ( ii ) substracted _ the whole foreground template_. in fig . 
 ( [ fig : rottest ] ) we plot the average @xmath4 s for these simulations , after adding ( dotted line ) and substracting ( dashed line ) the residuals for several angular displacements . 
 the shaded bands display the 1@xmath27 dispersion areas . 
 the errors practically equal the statistical estimates of eq . 
 ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) . to summarize , foregrounds do not significantly affect our estimated amplitude of the tsz contribution .    finally , we removed from our galaxy template all those pixels that were associated with known galaxy clusters . 
 we used the aco and apm catalogues of optically selected clusters and the xbc @xcite , de grandi @xcite , noras @xcite , rosat - pspc @xcite and vogues @xcite x - ray cluster catalogues . 
 we excised from the analyses all pixels lying within a virial radius of the cluster center ( taken to be ten times the core radius ) . for clusters without measured core radius but with known redshift 
 , we assumed a virial radius of 1.7 mpc , and removed all pixels within that distance . 
 for the rest ( the majority ) , we conservatively removed all pixels within a circle of 30 arcmin from the cluster centre . out of the 2048 pixels for @xmath37 , 
 1681 were eliminated . 
 for the patches with @xmath38 , i.e. , the next @xmath360,000 densest pixels in fig.([fig : allpxls]c ) , a large fraction of them were also associated to known clusters and were eliminated with the excising . in fig.([fig : diffuse ] ) we show the cross correlation of these remaining pixels outside known clusters with the clean w band map . 
 note that here patch sortening has been regenerated using surviving pixels . for the densest sets of @xmath24 64 ( filled circles ) , 128 ( triangles ) and 256 ( diamonds ) 
 , we still find evidence of tsz , but at much lower level of significance . 
 for the densest 64 pixels , subtending @xmath39 square degrees on the sky , we obtain @xmath40k , at @xmath41 significance level . 
 the signal gets dilluted rapidly as more pixels are included in the analysis : @xmath42k and @xmath43k for @xmath24 128 , 256 , respectively . out of the 64 densest pixels , 54 pixels 
 are in the zoa , and 45 of them coincide with five different cluster candidates in the ciza @xcite catalogue , ( ebeling , private communication ) . 
 the remaining group of pixels are not associated to any known galaxy cluster . in fig . 
 ( [ fig : mappxls ] ) we plot the location of those pixels in the sky . 
 the shaded area correspond to the kp0 mask , that also remove many point sources outside the galactic plane ( dark grey dots ) . 
 the 64 pixels are ploted as big white circles for convenience . 
 under the assumption that galaxies trace hot gas , we have used the 2mass galaxy catalogue to search for tsz signal present in wmap data . in @xmath44 square degrees on the sky we have found a contribution of average amplitude -35 @xmath0 7 @xmath1k , spectrally compatible with tsz , and mostly generated by aco clusters of galaxies . 
 our study , based on a pixel - to - pixel comparison , reaches the highest sensitivity level reported so far . 
 compared with methods based on power spectrum or correlation function analysis , our method gives a larger level of significance since we restrict the analysis to the regions of the sky where the tsz contribution is expected to be the largest . 
 we have found that the typical angular extension of this signal is somewhere between 2030 arcmins . 
 furthermore , once all known clusters of galaxies are excised from the analysis , we are left with @xmath39 square degrees with an average amplitude of @xmath45k : those pixels fall mostly in the zoa and after performing our analyses we found that 45 of them are associated to five different galaxy clusters in the ciza catalogue . 
 we have found no conclusive evidence that , in the volume probed by 2mass , structures less bound than clusters contribute to the tsz signal present in the wmap data .

58,"the equivalence principle tells us that a particle under constant acceleration can be viewed as a particle under the influence of a static gravitational field . 
 explicit coordinate transformation shows that a particle moving in a hyperbolic trajectory due to constant acceleration in minkowski spacetime is equivalent to a particle moving in a geodesic in rindler spacetime . under the coordinate tranformation , 
 positive frequency modes in minkowski spacetime are expressed as the mixture of positive and negative frequency rindler modes . 
 this implies that the minkowski vacuum annihilated by positive minkowski modes is not equivalent to the rindler vacuum . 
 as shown in @xcite , an accelerated observer sees the minkowski vacuum filled with rindler particles . 
 the spectrum of rindler particles is thermal , similar to the spectrum of the hawking radiation from a blackhole@xcite . 
 the unruh effect modifies the quantum dynamics of accelerated systems in a nontrivial way causing apparent discrepancy between the interpretation of radiation emission and absorption between accelerated and static observers@xcite . 
 stimulated by recent progress in quantum information science , various attempts to understand relativistic quantum phenomena from the view of quantum information have been made@xcite . 
 quantum teleportation between a static and an accelerated observer was discussed in @xcite , where one of the cavities containing a single mode is assumed to follow the accelerated trajectory . 
 because there was no consideration of dynamical aspects and other crucial features in @xcite , their derivation is not expected to be applicable in the general situation@xcite . 
 the entanglement in the system with one accelerated and one static@xcite and both accelerated@xcite was discussed . 
 entanglement dynamics involving accelerated observers was studied in @xcite .    on the problem of black hole information loss@xcite , entanglement in the hawking pair 
 is often regarded as a crucial ingredient to rescue information from a black hole in the form of the hawking radiation@xcite . 
 the nonlocal process present in quantum teleportation is also considered to play a role@xcite . 
 more recently , it was speculated that if the collapsing matter and incoming hawking particle at the black hole singularity@xcite are maximally entangled , information can escape from a black hole as a process similar to the quantum teleportation . 
 this scenario , unfortunately , is likely flawed by the interaction between the collapsing matter and the incoming hawking flux@xcite , in the case of the qubit teleportation assuming the random unitary interaction between the original state and one of the entangled pair@xcite , however , nearly perfect information can be restored with proper encoding after quantum error correction . 
 it is of interest to see if the same scenario works in the spacetime with a horizon . 
 motivated by these works , in this paper , we study the dynamical evolution of quantum entanglement and fidelity during quantum teleportation due to accelerated motion of observers . near horizon , 
 the rindler metric is equivalent to the schwartzchild metric . 
 thus our work can be viewed as performing a quantum simulation of information flow around the black hole horizon . 
 first we develop a general framework to study the entanglement among an arbitrary number of observers generalizing the formalism in @xcite to the relativistic setting . 
 each observer s quantum state is assumed to be described by a harmonic oscillator , which couples linearly with a scalar quantum field . in this work , 
 we consider the vacuum state of the field as environment . 
 we are primarily interested in the quantum state of observers and trace out all the field modes in our calculation . then we study the entanglement dynamics among observers quantum states when each observer is allowed to move in a prescribed trajectory . 
 when one of the observers is subjected to constant acceleration , his worldline in a minkowski coordinate becomes a hyperbolic curve and asymptotically approaches his event horizon . 
 the observer sees the minkowski vacuum as a thermal state . 
 entanglement between his and other observers states will be modified accordingly . 
 perturbative approximations such as born or born - markov approximations are widely used for the study of decay processes and estimation of various quantities of open systems . 
 radiation processes from the accelerated particles and near black holes@xcite are often studied under these approximations . however , naive perturbation expansions do not guarantee the positivity of the reduced density matrix . entanglement properties are measured by the negativity of the partially transposed density matrix and sensitive to the positivity of the density matrix . for this reason , in this paper , we try to use an exact expression without making perturbative approximations . 
 nonperturbative analysis is one of the key achievements in solving the apparent paradox in the radiation - reaction process viewed in inertial and accelerated frames@xcite . 
 fluctuations of the canonical phase variables obey uncertainty relations . 
 uncertainties are modified in the presence of the environment . in the system out of equilibrium , they are time - dependent . in order to set up the quantum teleportation protocol@xcite using our oscillator variables , we introduce another observer who carries a state to be teleported . 
 we study uncertainties in the multi - modes and follow their dynamical evolution . 
 we are particularly interested in the case when one observer is under constant acceleration and study how motion of the observer affects uncertainties . 
 although uncertainty relations should always be satisfied by any physical states in principle , they are no longer guaranteed under perturbative approximations . similarly to entanglement , they are sensitive to the positivity of the density matrix . next we study entanglement among these observers . as shown in @xcite , uncertainty relations in the partially transposed density matrix give the necessary and sufficient condition for separability . 
 entanglement measures , negativity and the log - negativity , will also be calculated from the uncertainties . 
 next we study entanglement among these three observers and clarify the relation between bipartite and tripartite entanglement . 
 for a three - mode oscillator system , it is possible to find the genuine tripartite entanglement @xmath0 from the monogamy relation@xcite . in the conventional quantum optical setup for the teleportation@xcite , 
 the effect of vacuum is treated locally and there is no role for the tripartite entanglement . in our case , vacuum is a ground state of the quantum field which spreads nonlocally in spacetime 
 . therefore its influence on the observers will develop nonlocal correlation between their states . in order to see this 
 , we set the initial state in a product state between a coherent and a two - mode squeezed state and see how the system develops tripartite entanglement dynamically in time . 
 then we perform quantum teleportation using an entangled pair one of which is carried by a receiver under constant acceleration . 
 we include the effect of quantum field continuously interacting with the system and calculate time - dependent teleportation fidelity as a measure of success of teleportation . 
 first we study the case with arbitrary final states of the sender and the carrier of one of the entangled pair by summing over all possible states between them . 
 next we consider the generalized final state to which their state will be projected after the measurement to be in a two - mode squeezed state . 
 we send the measurement result to the receiver followed by the appropriate unitary transformation on his state so as to recover the original state with generic initial and final squeezed states and see how much information can be recovered . 
 we consider both in the presence and absence of the interaction between the system and field . 
 we first obtain the general expression for the fidelity for arbitrary amount of squeezing for the initial and final state 
 . then we look at the limiting case when the final state is maximally entangled . in the conventional quantum teleportation scheme 
 , the final state is generally assumed to be maximally entangled while the initial squeezing is finite due to experimental limitation . 
 since our motivation is to probe black hole information loss from the possiblly unknown final state , we consider the generalized final state by introducing a finite squeezing parameter . in all cases , 
 we obtain the exact dynamical expressions for the fidelity . 
 we also study the asymptotic long time limit of the fidelity and discuss the implications of our results on the black hole information problem .    in sec . 
 2 , we develop general formulation for @xmath1 observers each carrying quantum state moving in a four - dimensional spacetime interacting with quantum fields . 
 tracing out quantum fields , we obtain the reduced density matrix for @xmath1 observers quantum state . in sec . 3 , from a correlation matrix of the system 
 , we calculate uncertainty relations for multi - modes . also from the correlation matrix after partial transpose , we calculate the bipartite entanglement measures for two and three modes from which we obtain genuine tripartite entanglement . 
 we give a detailed study of the time evolution of these quantities under the influence of the environment in the absence and presence of acceleration of one observer . in sec . 
 4 , quantum teleportation among three parties is studied . 
 we first study the case by integrating out all the final states and look at the time evolution of the teleportation fidelity . 
 while introducing the basic scheme of teleportation , we generalize the possible final state to an arbitrary two - mode squeezed state . 
 then we consider the effect of the environment for the protocol and study the time evolution of the fidelity . 
 we obtain the result for the maximally entangled final state by taking the infinite squeezing limit of the final state . 
 finally we consider the maximally entangled initial and final states including the environment . 
 we will study the full time evolution and the long time , weak coupling limit of the fidelity . 
 we will use natural units : @xmath2 . 
 we consider the system composed of @xmath1 observers moving in prescribed trajectories . 
 our hamiltonian is a relativistic generalization of a @xmath1-brownian oscillator model studied in @xcite and given by @xmath3 where the bare potential @xmath4 is a sum of the physical potential @xmath5 and the counter term @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 with the frequency cutoff @xmath9 for the scalar field below . 
 each oscillator variable @xmath10 couples linearly with the scalar field @xmath11 at @xmath12 as @xmath13 we assume that @xmath10 is an internal coordinate of a @xmath14-th observer which depends on a proper time @xmath15 of the observer . 
 our total hamiltonian is thus lorentz invariant . 
 the field hamiltonian for each @xmath11 in a @xmath16-dimensional space is @xmath17.\end{aligned}\ ] ] each field @xmath11 allows a mode decomposition : @xmath18 with @xmath19 . 
 the heisenberg equations that @xmath10 satisfy are @xmath20 where @xmath21 \sin \left [ \omega_k ( t(\tau_j)-t(\tau'_l))\right]/2\omega_k \label{alphai}\end{aligned}\ ] ] is an imaginary part of the response function@xcite defined as + @xmath22   e^{-i\omega_k ( t(\tau_j)-t(\tau'_l))}/2\omega_k$ ] , where @xmath23 . 
 we set the initial condition at @xmath24 hypersurface when all observers are at rest with their proper times set to @xmath25 for all @xmath14 . 
 eq.([el1 ] ) contains nonlocal kernels @xmath26 and the exact time evolution of @xmath10 at @xmath27 depends on its and other observer s past history . 
 thus the dynamics of @xmath10 is not markovian . 
 = .45    let us consider the case @xmath28 in which the first observer bob is accelerated with a constant acceleration @xmath29 in an accelerated trajectory so that its coordinate is given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . 
 the second observer alice and the third observer chris s locations are fixed at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . 
 we assume that alice and bob are close to each other ( @xmath34 ) and share a common environment ( @xmath35 ) , while the accelerated observer bob is located in a distance such that @xmath36 can be treated as independently coupling to an environment . the response functions ( [ alphai ] ) 
 are then given by @xmath37   e^{-i\omega_k ( t(\tau)-t(\tau'))}/2\omega_k , \nonumber\\ % \alpha_{jj}(\tau,\tau')&= & \lambda_{j}^2 \sum_k   e^{-i\omega_k ( \tau-\tau')}/2\omega_k   ~(\mbox{for } ~j=2,3 ) , \nonumber \\ % \alpha_{23}(\tau,\tau')&=&\alpha_{32}(\tau,\tau')= \lambda_{2}\lambda_{3 } \sum_k   \cos ( l k ) e^{-i\omega_k ( \tau-\tau')}/2\omega_k ,    \label{alphai2 } % \end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath38 . 
 note that the coordinate time @xmath39 and the proper time are the same for alice and chris but not for bob . 
 the most interesting term above is @xmath40 where each mode in minkowski spacetime is expressed in rindler coordinates . 
 the conversion of modes in different spacetimes is given by the bogoliubov transformation between annihilation / creation operators@xcite . 
 writing the momentum space integral in ( [ field ] ) in terms of rindler modes reproduces a standard derivation of the unruh effect based on the bogoliubov transformation@xcite . for a massless field @xmath41 in a three dimensional space , the kernels in ( [ alphai2 ] ) can be brought to the following form : @xmath42 , \nonumber\\   \alpha_{jj}(\tau)&= & \frac{\lambda_{j}^2}{2\pi^2 } \int_{0}^{\lambda } dk k \left [   \cos(k \tau)-i\sin ( k \tau ) \right ] , ~(\mbox{for } ~j=2,3 ) , \nonumber\\ %   \alpha_{23}(\tau)&= & \alpha_{32}(\tau ) = \frac{\lambda_{2}\lambda_{3}}{\pi^2 l } \int_{0}^{\lambda } dk k \sin ( l k ) \left [ \cos(k \tau)-i\sin ( k \tau ) \right ] . 
 % \end{aligned}\ ] ] the kernel @xmath43 is responsible for the interaction between alice and chris s state that becomes negligible for large separation as @xmath44 , which is a characteristic decay of a massless field in three dimension and justifies neglecting the interaction between the accelerated observer and the rest of observers . 
 comparing the first kernel @xmath45 with that of the influence functional@xcite , we see that the first observer sees the vacuum as a thermal bath with the unruh temperature @xmath46@xcite . 
 writing the influence kernel directly in the rindler time has advantages in studying quantum dynamical aspects of observer s quantum states under the influence of the unruh effect , which we will describe below in details .    for large @xmath9 and small separation @xmath47 , 
 the heisenberg equations of motion for three coordinate variables can be written in the local form : @xmath48 where we write @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 . 
 the divergence from nonlocal terms are canceled by counter terms . for our case , @xmath52 . 
 hereafter we will set @xmath53 . 
 we write the solution for the first equation in ( [ elnr1 ] ) with initial conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 . a pair of solutions of ( [ elnr2 ] ) with initial conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 
 , @xmath61 will be written as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . 
 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the solutions are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 are the solutions corresponding to two normal modes of a coupled oscillator and @xmath69 . 
 general solutions with arbitrary initial conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the heisenberg equations ( [ elnr1 ] ) and ( [ elnr2 ] ) for @xmath50 are @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . 
 the expectation value of phase space variables can be expressed in the matrix form : @xmath75 the time evolution matrix @xmath76 for our solutions is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 . 
 it is convenient for our purpose to use a characteristic function for the wigner representation@xcite . 
 for the @xmath1-particle system : @xmath83 ,     \label{chiw }      \end{aligned}\ ] ] where we defined @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . 
 the matrix @xmath88 is scaled accordingly . 
 now we trace out the field @xmath89 in order to obtain the reduced dynamics of the system . in our case 
 @xmath28 with a factorized initial condition : @xmath90 , @xmath91 is also factorized into two parts as @xmath92 .

 a separability criterion for a bipartite two - level - system can be naturally extended to continuous gaussian variables@xcite . 
 the necessary and sufficient condition for separability of the density matrix is to have only non - negative eigenvalues after the partial transpose of one of its subsystem . for gaussian variables in the wigner distribution , 
 the partial transpose of a density matrix in one of the oscillator component is equivalent to a mirror reflection of that component . 
 the necessary and sufficient condition for the general @xmath118 bipartite gaussian modes to be separable is that the partially mirror reflected state is still a physical quantum state that satisfies the uncertainty principle@xcite . 
 for instance , for three oscillators , the bipartite entanglement between the first and the rest of oscillators can be measured by first taking a partial mirror reflection on the first variable in the phase space as @xmath119 , then seeing if the resulting state satisfies or violates the uncertainty relation . 
 note that the total mirror reflection does not change the entanglement properties thus the reflection on the second and third variables yields the same result . in terms of @xmath120 , this can be expressed as a matrix multiplication by the matrix @xmath121 as @xmath122 . 
 it follows that the partial mirror reflection transforms the covariance matrix as @xmath123    from williamson s theorem@xcite , there exists a symplectic transformation that diagonalizes any positive - definite @xmath124 symmetric matrix into the following form : @xmath125 although such a symplectic transformation does not preserve the eigenvalue spectrum in general , the diagonal components @xmath126 for @xmath127 can be calculated as follows . writing a commutation relation in a @xmath128 matrix form as @xmath129=i\gamma_{ij}$ ] with @xmath130 we construct a real symmetric matrix @xmath131 . 
 this matrix has an eigenvalue spectrum @xmath132 ( @xmath133)@xcite . the uncertainty relation can be generalized to a symplectic invariant form @xmath134 . by changing to the diagonalized form @xmath135 above 
 , the uncertainty relation is equivalent to saying that @xmath136 for all @xmath99 .      for a bipartite continuous variable system 
 , there is a criteria for a necessary and sufficient condition for separability@xcite . 
 we write the @xmath137 covariance matrix here as @xmath138 then eigenvalues @xmath132 can be written explicitly in terms of the following symplectic invariants @xmath139 constructed from the determinants of covariances @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 as @xmath143 then @xmath144 .

 the separability conditions are @xmath148 note that the inequalities for @xmath149 and @xmath150 follow automatically from those for @xmath151 and @xmath152 . 
 thus @xmath152 carries the essential information on the separability of quantum states . 
 let us consider a two - mode squeezed state with a squeezing parameter @xmath153 as an initial state@xcite . 
 its correlation matrix is @xmath154 in the wigner representation , the same state can be expressed as @xmath155 -e^{-2r}\left [ \omega(r_1+r_2)^2+(p_1-p_2)^2/\omega\right]}.                 \label{wepr}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this state can be obtained by acting a squeezing operator @xmath156 on the vacuum . for a large squeezing @xmath157 , @xmath158 , thus it becomes the epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) state@xcite .    in fig . 
 2 , the temporal behavior of the uncertainty @xmath151 as a function of the proper time of bob is plotted . 
 the initial state is a pure two mode squeezed state introduced above . 
 this state satisfies the uncertainty relation with the minimum uncertainty @xmath159 . 
 as the state becomes mixed , the uncertainty first increases in time and oscillates periodically . 
 acceleration of the observer yields larger uncertainty by making the amplitude of oscillations larger . 
 = 0.8    in fig . 
 3 , the temporal behavior of @xmath151 ( uncertainty ) and @xmath152 ( uncertainty after the partial transpose ) is plotted . 
 the initial state is a pure two mode squeezed state with @xmath160 . 
 the state exhibits environment - induced disentanglement at @xmath161 with no acceleration and at @xmath162 with acceleration . 
 the role of acceleration is similar to that of temperature that increases the disentanglement rate . 
 now we study entanglement measures ; the negativity and the log negativity . 
 the negativity @xmath163@xcite for our system can be defined as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the reduced density matrix after the partial transpose . 
 @xmath163 is equal to the sum of all negative eigenvalues of @xmath165 . 
 thus it measures how much @xmath165 fails to be positive . 
 the peres criteria@xcite tell us that this can be used as a measure of entanglement . 
 it is an entanglement monotone , which does not increase under local operations and classical communications . the logarithmic negativity @xmath166 defined as @xmath167 is also an entanglement monotone . 
 the diagonalization of @xmath168 changes the original state into the thermal state . 
 then the partially transposed density matrix @xmath165 after the same transformation also has the thermal form . 
 it can be written in terms of the symplectic invariants @xmath169 as @xmath170 for separable states , @xmath171 . then @xmath172 and @xmath173 . 
 for entangled states , @xmath174 but @xmath175 . 
 thus both @xmath163 and @xmath166 can be expressed in terms of @xmath152 as @xmath176 , \nonumber\\ e_{\cal{n}}&=&\mbox{max}\left[0 , -\ln ( 2 \lambda_{-})\right ] . 
 \label{negativity2 }     \end{aligned}\ ] ] in fig . 
 4 , the negativity @xmath177 and the logarithmic negativity @xmath166 are shown as a function of the proper time . 
 the initial state is a two mode squeezed state . 
 they both vanish at the same time since they both give the necessary and sufficient condition of bipartite entanglement . 
 the larger acceleration yields the larger disentanglement rate . 
 = 0.7    = 0.7      it is convenient to characterize an @xmath178-mode uncertainty relation as a sum of symplectic invariants@xcite as @xmath179 where @xmath180 are principal minors@xcite of the matrix @xmath181 of order @xmath182 . 
 we defined @xmath183 .    for the matrix in the williamson normal form ( [ williamson ] ) , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is an unordered set of different integers between @xmath186 and @xmath178 . 
 then we have @xmath187 thus the uncertainty relation implies @xmath188 .    for the tripartite case @xmath189 , we write @xmath190 then @xmath191 where  @xmath192 stands for the codeterminant . 
 = 0.5    in fig . 5 
 , @xmath193 is plotted as a function of time . 
 @xmath194 throughout the entire evolution indicates that the uncertainty relation is always satisfied . 
 the effect of acceleration is again similar to the effect of temperature which increases the uncertainty .    under the partial transpose on the first variable , @xmath195,@xmath196,@xmath197,@xmath198 change signs and the uncertainty after the partial transpose @xmath199 becomes @xmath200 where @xmath201    from ( 37 ) , @xmath202 for separable states , each term on the right hand side is nonnegative , thus @xmath203 follows . for our interest of @xmath204 mode 
 bipartite system , or more generally , @xmath205 bipartite system , @xmath206 is shown to give a necessary and sufficient condition for separability@xcite . 
 three - mode entanglement for continuous variables can be categorized into the following sets@xcite based on the values of the bipartite entanglement measure @xmath207 with @xmath208 ( @xmath209 is bipartite entanglement between alice and bob - chris together ) : ( 1 ) fully entangled states ( none of @xmath207 is vanishing . ) , ( 2 ) one - mode biseparable states ( only one of @xmath207 is vanishing . ) , ( 3 ) two - mode biseparable states ( only two of @xmath207 are vanishing . ) , ( 4 ) three - mode biseparable states ( all of @xmath207 are vanishing but these states can not be written as a mixture of tripartite product states ) , ( 5 ) fully separable states ( mixture of tripartite product states ) .    for bipartite entanglement for three qubits , the square of the concurrence @xmath210 is known to satisfy the following monogamy inequality@xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the concurrence between @xmath213 and @xmath214 , etc . 
 the inequality also holds for gaussian states if we take the square of the logarithmic negativity@xcite . 
 genuine tripartite entanglement for continuous variables @xmath0 can be defined by minimizing the difference between the left - hand and the right - hand side for all possible combinations of three subsystems , namely , @xmath215 note that the monogamy inequality guarantees @xmath216 . in fig . 
 6 , the temporal evolution of bipartite entanglement @xmath217,@xmath218,@xmath219 are shown . 
 the initial state is chosen to be the product state of a two - mode squeezed state of alice and bob and a coherent state of chris . thus initially 
 as time evolves , decoherence due to the interaction with the environment@xcite causes @xmath217 to damp out . 
 the interaction with the environment induces entanglement between alice and chris s state , which evolves periodically in time and some of entanglement in @xmath217 tranfers to @xmath218 . 
 there is no entanglement between bob and chris s state during the entire period since there is neither initial nor interaction - induced entanglement between them . 
 note a dual role of the environment . 
 it is both the source of multipartite entanglement between observers and of decoherence that decreases entanglement . 
 the former causes initial increase and the latter causes damping of entanglement in time . the similar behavior is already seen in two static brownian oscillators@xcite . in fig . 
 7 , the temporal evolution of @xmath0 is shown . 
 the initial state is the same as in fig . 
 6 , a product state of a two - mode squeezed state of alice and bob and a ground state of chris . 
 thus initially there is no genuine tripartite entanglement . 
 the nonlocal vacuum generates entanglement among three variables . the same vacuum also induces decoherence which eventually washes away all entanglement . 
 the unruh effect suppresses both bipartite and tripartite entanglement . 
 = 0.4 = 0.4    = 0.4 = 0.4 
 many interacting quantum systems can be simulated with a proper design of quantum circuits@xcite , where the interaction among subsystems are mimicked by quantum gates . along with the properly chosen measurement and post - selection scheme 
 , we can simulate many interesting systems under nontrivial situations . in @xcite , 
 similarity between information escaping from a black hole and a quantum teleportation protocol was pointed out . in the presence of the generic interaction between collapsing matter and a hawking particle , however , unitarity can not be completely rescued@xcite . 
 encoding quantum states with quantum error correction may still recover the full information .    in these works , 
 only speculations about the possible quantum process in and around a black hole are given based on the analogies with quantum circuits . 
 no analysis on the curved spacetime was provided . 
 it is important to note that qubits studied there are in a flat spacetime without event horizon while information loss is predicted in quantum theory in curved spacetimes with event horizon that hides information . 
 since our model can simulate the quantum dynamics of many observers moving in an arbitrary fashion , it provides a good setting to study the unruh effect on various quantum protocols . from the equivalence principle , 
 the acceleration due to gravitational force can be locally transformed away by the appropriate coordinate transformation . in the absence of other forces 
 , the observer then follows a geodesic in a curved spacetime . 
 the unruh effect on a constantly accelerated observer can be identified as the effect on the static observer in rindler spacetime . since near the rindler horizon 
 , the rindler spacetime looks similar to the schwartzchild black hole spacetime , this is equivalent to studying the hawking effect on the quantum dynamics of a static observer near a black hole event horizon . 
 = 0.4 = 0.33    in fig . 8 , 
 our quantum teleportation scheme in ( b ) is compared to the scenario in @xcite of information escaping from a black hole in ( a ) . in both figures 
 , two parties are falling inside of the horizon and hit one region while the other party is moving toward future without falling inside of the horizon . the role of singularity in ( a ) 
 is viewed as an effectively boundary condition , while it is replaced by the measurement performed at some time in ( b ) . 
 if bob is under constant acceleration indefinitely , once alice passes the event horizon , we need an additional mechanism to send the measurement result to bob for the teleportation to be successful . in the figure , 
 a pair of wormholes are used to retrieve the measurement result . in @xcite , this was simply assumed as pointed out in @xcite . in the present work 
 , we view our scheme as a simulation of the process possibly occurring around a black hole and are only interested in the process until the measurement is performed . 
 bob can stop accelerating eventually and receive the message from alice . 
 this is indeed the situation analogous to a decaying black hole@xcite . 
 although our system does not include gravitational interaction between observers , as we saw in sec . 
 3 , the background field induces the effective interaction and entanglement between them . 
 quantum teleportation with continuous variables based on @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally@xcite . 
 initially alice and bob share a two - mode squeezed state . the mode carried by alice 
 is mixed with chris s state prepared in a coherent state through the @xmath221 % beam - splitter . 
 their state is measured by the homodyne detector and the result is sent to bob through the classical channel . 
 bob s state is shifted according to the measurement result in order to reproduce the same state as chris s . 
 now let us first discuss our problem , instead of measuring the state of alice and chris , by tracing over all states for alice and chris at some time in the future@xcite . 
 since we are concerned with the unruh effect on the quantum teleportation protocol , first we consider the influence of the environment only on alice and bob s state . 
 then chris s state remains in a pure state and the density matrix is the direct product of chris s and alice and bob s state as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 can be a mixed state density matrix . 
 the fidelity @xmath224 is an overlap between bob s final state and chris s initial state given by @xmath225 | \alpha \rangle_b \\ & = & \frac{2}{d^{(0)1/2 } } \exp\left [ -\frac{\gamma_1^{(0)}\alpha^2}{d^{(0 ) } } -\frac{\bar{\gamma}_1^{(0)}\bar{\alpha}^2}{d^{(0 ) } } -\frac{2\gamma_2^{(0)}}{d^{(0)}}|\alpha|^2 \right ] , \nonumber \label{fnm}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath226 and @xmath227 and @xmath228 . 
 it is easy to see that the fidelity for this process gives an one - mode @xmath229 distribution function for bob s state . 
 the more alice and bob s quantum state is squeezed , the more it is entangled . 
 then after tracing out alice s degree of freedom , bob s state is more mixed and the less fidelity results . 
 this is opposite to what we expect in the teleportation scheme where large entanglement between alice and bob yields high fidelity in the teleported state as we will see below . 
 the fidelity takes its largest value at the center @xmath230 as @xmath231 . after a long time , bob s state thermalizes at the unruh temperature . 
 the off - diagonal components of the correlation matrix will vanish and , in the weak coupling limit , their diagonal components are given by @xmath232 . 
 this gives @xmath233 and the long time limit of @xmath224 can be written as a function of acceleration as @xmath234 . 
 \label{fnmlongt}\end{aligned}\ ] ] we see that this is independent of the initial squeezing . 
 the peak value @xmath235 $ ] takes from @xmath186 to @xmath236 as the acceleration @xmath29 varies from @xmath236 to @xmath237 . 
 we see that @xmath238 measures the overlap between bob s and the ground state . 
 for the zero acceleration case , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , thus there is no loss of information . 
 = 0.4 = 0.4    in fig . 
 9 , the time evolution of @xmath224 is plotted . the initial decay ( a ) 
 is followed by the oscillations ( b ) with the fundamental oscillator frequency @xmath241 . 
 we see that the acceleration suppresses fidelity similarly to the effect of temperature .    in the scheme of quantum teleportation for qubits or continuous variables , 
 after chris s state is mixed with alice s , their states are measured and the measurement result is send to bob in a distance . in the continuous variable quantum teleportation , the homodyne measurement on alice and chris s state projects their state to the maximally entangled epr state . 
 the imprecision involved in the measurement can be included , for instance , by making gaussian smearing of the epr state . here 
 we take into account the finite uncertainty in the projected state by considering a two - mode squeezed final state with a squeezing parameter @xmath242 . 
 we denote the measurement result as a complex number @xmath243 , where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are both real numbers . 
 thus after the measurement , the original quantum state of alice and chris is projected to @xmath246 where the translation operator @xmath247 is given by @xmath248 in the limit @xmath249 , @xmath250 becomes the maximally - entangled epr state . 
 after the measurement of alice and chris s state , the density matrix for bob becomes @xmath251 where @xmath252 is a normalization constant . with this normalization , @xmath253 is equal to the probability to obtain the measurement result @xmath254 . bob s state is shifted depending on the measurement result @xmath254 so that the final state of bob is @xmath255 . 
 the teleportation fidelity @xmath224 is an overlap between bob s final state @xmath256 and chris s initial state @xmath257 and given by @xmath258    suppose we do not make post - selection following the measurement , the fidelity becomes , instead of ( [ fidel ] ) , @xmath259 in this case , the averaged fidelity over all measurement outcome @xmath254 is @xmath260 similarly to ( [ stateafterhom ] ) we write the initial two - mode squeezed state ( [ wepr ] ) in the fock space representation as @xmath261 ) , we obtain @xmath262 $ ] in the @xmath249 limit . 
 then @xmath263 as initial squeezing @xmath264 gets larger . 
 this tells us that quantum teleportation can not be successful without post - selection .    on the other hand , with post selection 
 , the average fidelity can be shown to be @xmath265 for a coherent state @xmath264 , @xmath266 and for any positive squeezing , @xmath267 . since @xmath266 is a maximal value achieved by the classical method@xcite . 
 we see that the initial entanglement in alice and bob s state is essential for quantum teleportation . 
 now we consider the effect of the environment on the performance of teleportation . 
 in our situation , the environment acts continuously on the system so that the final density matrix of bob depends on how we send the measurement result of alice and chris to bob . in order to eliminate this ambiguity , here we consider the effect of the environment up to the point when alice and chris s state is measured . 
 we introduce the complex variables @xmath268 to simplify the expression as follows : @xmath269 with a measurement outcome @xmath254 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 can be calculated straightforwardly . 
 both can be written in the gaussian form : @xmath272   \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath273 . 
 \label{pbetahom}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the normalization factors and coefficients in exponents are both dependent on the correlation matrix and initial condition . as a result , they have the complicated time dependence as follows 
 . we will write @xmath274 and @xmath275 for @xmath276 below : @xmath277 , \nonumber\\ & -&d_2^{-1}d_1^{-2}s_2 ^ 4 [ ( |\delta_1|^2 + c_3(c_3+c_4))(\delta_5 ^ 2 \bar{\delta}_1 + \delta_6 ^ 2 \delta_1 )   + 2 \delta_5 \delta_6 ( |\delta_1|^2 ( 2c_3+c_4)+c_3 ^ 2 c_4 ) ] , \nonumber\\ q&=&\delta_4 + 1-d_1^{-1}[\bar{\delta}_1\delta_5\bar{\delta}_6 + \delta_1\bar{\delta}_5\delta_6+c_3(|\delta_5|^2+|\delta_6|^2)]+   \nonumber\\ d_2^{-1}d_1^{-2}s_2 ^ 4 & [ & ( |\delta_1|^2 + c_3(c_3+c_4))(\delta_5 \bar{\delta}_1 \bar{\delta}_6 + \bar{\delta}_5\delta_1 \delta_6 )   + ( |\delta_1|^2(2c_3+c_4 ) + c_3 ^ 2 c_4)(|\delta_5|^2+|\delta_6|^2 ) ] , \nonumber\\ f_1 & = &   d_2 d_1 -s_2 ^ 3[\delta_5(|\delta_1|^2+c_3c_4)+\delta_1\delta_6 ( c_3+c_4)],\nonumber\\ f_2 & = & -s_2 ^ 3 [ \delta_5\bar{\delta}_1(c_3+c_4)+\delta_6   ( |\delta_1|^2+c_3c_4)],\nonumber\\ \gamma_3 & = & d_1(d_1\delta_3-b_1)/d_4,\nonumber\\ \gamma_4 & = & d_1(d_1(\delta_4 + 1)-b_2)/d_4 , \nonumber\\ n_{p1 } & = & \frac{4 c_3 n_b}{d_4^{1/2}}. \label{variouscoeff}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the averaged fidelity over all measurement outcome @xmath254 is @xmath278 where @xmath279    = 0.4 = 0.4    in fig . 10 , the time evolution of the averaged fidelity is plotted . 
 for the final state to be in a squeezed state with a finite squeezing parameter @xmath242 , the initial fidelity is not one . 
 the short time decay rate is increased with stronger system - field coupling and with larger acceleration of bob as seen in fig . 
 the long time evolution exhibits damped oscillations . the larger the acceleration , the larger the damping rate results . 
 the expressions in ( [ variouscoeff ] ) become much simpler if there is no interaction with the environment . in this case , @xmath280 and @xmath281 .

 when the final projected state becomes maximally entangled , @xmath288 , then @xmath289 and @xmath290 thus we reproduced eq . 
 ( [ favps ] ) . furthermore , when the initial state of alice and bob becomes maximally entangled , @xmath291 , then @xmath292 . 
 thus there is no loss of fidelity in this limit .    in the proposed quantum teleportation scheme , the state for alice and chris after measurement is assumed to be maximally entangled . 
 it is the bell state for the qubit teleportation@xcite and the epr state for the continuous variable teleportation@xcite . 
 the latter can be obtained by taking @xmath288 in ( [ stateafterhom ] ) as @xmath293 this is the epr state shifted by the displacement operator @xmath247 . in this limit , 
 bob s state after measurement becomes @xmath294 the elements in ( [ pbetahom ] ) become somewhat simpler as @xmath295 \label{qhom } \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath296 . \nonumber\label{pbetahom2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the coefficients are @xmath297 , \nonumber\\   \gamma_6 & = & \frac{1}{d_5 d_6 }   \left [ \bar{s}uv+s\bar{u}\bar{v}+r(|u|^2+|v|^2 ) \right]+\frac{\delta_4 + 1}{d_5 } , \nonumber\\   \gamma_7 & = & \frac{1}{d_5 d_6 }   \left [ \bar{s}uw+s\bar{v}\bar{w}+ru\bar{w}+r\bar{v}w\right ]   + \frac{\delta_3}{d_5 } , \nonumber\\ \gamma_8 & = & \delta_3 d_5^{-1},\nonumber\\ \gamma_9 & = &   ( \delta_4 + 1 ) d_5^{-1 } , \nonumber\\ \gamma_{10 } & = & \frac{1}{4 d_5 d_6}\left [ \bar{s}w^2+s\bar{w}^2 + 2r|w|^2 \right ] . 
 \label{variouscoeffinf}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the averaged fidelity over all measurement outcome @xmath254 in this case is @xmath298 where @xmath299    = 0.4 = 0.4    in fig . 11 , the time evolution of the average fidelity for the maximally entangled final state is plotted . for this final state , the initial average fidelity reaches the unit value as initial squeezing becomes infinitely large as seen in fig . 
 the long time evolution is again damped oscillatory with the damping rate enhanced by acceleration as shown in fig . 
 11(b ) .    in the absence of the environment , @xmath300 
 other coefficients will be simplified accordingly as @xmath301 thus we have @xmath302 and @xmath303 the fidelity becomes @xmath304 . 
 \label{fnoenv2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] ( [ hom0 ] ) , ( 74 ) , ( [ fnoenv2 ] ) can also be directly obtained from ( 63 ) by taking the limit of @xmath288 . 
 the same expression of @xmath305 as in ( 65 ) follows , consistent with the previous result for a generic initial and final squeezed state . in particular , in the absence of the environment , we achieve the unit fidelity for the quantum teleportation with the initial and final epr state , which is the case originally studied in @xcite . 
 we now consider the effect of the environment in this special case . 
 bob s state after measurement can be written similarly as in ( [ bobdm ] ) as @xmath306 here we consider the influence of environment on all three observer s states and wrote their state in the density matrix form as @xmath307 . 
 we obtain the averaged fidelity as @xmath308^{1/2 } } ,   \label{favepr}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath309 are components of a @xmath310 matrix made up of the components of the @xmath311 matrix @xmath312 in ( 21 ) . 
 we first write @xmath312 as @xmath313 then @xmath314    = 0.5    in fig . 
 12 , the time evolution of the average fidelity for the maximally entangled initial and final state is plotted . the decay is faster for larger acceleration . after the damped oscillatory behavior , 
 all curves appear to reach nonvanishing asymptotic values . 
 we will now show this is indeed the case .    in the long time limit 
 , the state of bob in the absence of alice and chris will thermalize at the unruh temperature @xmath315 similarly to the single particle quantum brownian motion at finite temperatures@xcite . on the other hand 
 , the state of alice and chris in the absence of bob will be in the steady oscillatory state ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . 
 now let us first assume the interaction of bob with the environment is negligible . in this case , 
 @xmath316 . in the weak coupling limit@xcite 
 , @xmath317 then @xmath318 follows 
 . this will give the averaged fidelity @xmath319 thus although there is still information loss , a part of quantum information manages to escape making quantum teleportation successful@xcite . 
 this case can be compared to @xcite , where the authors pointed out that the unitary quantum gates between the original qubit with one of the bell pair prior to the measurement ruin the unitarity of the transfer matrix , and to @xcite , where the author included random unitary gates in quantum circuits estimated the fidelity to be @xmath320 . 
 now we take into account the interaction between bob and the environment . 
 this will add the thermal factor in the induced fluctuations of bob s state in the long time limit as @xmath321 then @xmath322 the averaged fidelity in this case will decrease to @xmath323 where the equality holds for zero acceleration ( @xmath324 ) . 
 we see that quantum teleportation fails in this case . in this sense 
 , quantum information will be totally lost . 
 we studied the quantum entanglement dynamics of static and accelerated observers . due to the interaction with the environment , quantum states of the observer 
 suffer decoherence causing their entanglement to decay . 
 in addition , due to accelerated motion , the observer sees the vacuum as a thermal state , which enhances the rate of disentanglement in observers quantum states moving in the vacuum . 
 we derived uncertainties for the quantum states of two and three observers and saw their dynamical evolution . since our calculations are exact , uncertainty relations are always satisfied as they should be . 
 they are no longer guaranteed under perturbative approximations . 
 the evolution of uncertainties shows damped oscillations whose amplitudes are enhanced by the unruh effect . 
 the larger the acceleration of the observer , the larger the oscillation of uncertainties because the effective temperature ( unruh temperature ) for the thermal fluctuations is proportional to the acceleration . 
 the entanglement dynamics between two observers , one static and the other under constant acceleration was analyzed . from the uncertainty of the partially transposed density matrix , the negativity and the log - negativity were calculated . 
 they showed that the unruh effect on bob dynamically enhances the uncertainty after the partial transpose leading to the suppression of bipartite entanglement between alice and bob state . 
 we further studied tripartite entanglement between two static and one accelerated observer . 
 the acceleration modifies the three - mode uncertainty similarly to the two - mode uncertainty . 
 the three - mode uncertainty shows the damped oscillations while satisfying the uncertainty relation . 
 the environment dynamically modifies initial entanglement between alice and bob and induces entanglement between alice and chris . as a result , 
 bipartite entanglement @xmath217 and @xmath218 change in time in an opposite manner . 
 no bipartite entanglement is induced between bob and chris . 
 bipartite entanglement is suppressed by acceleration of observers . from the combinations of bipartite entanglement among three parties , the genuine tripartite entanglement @xmath0 
 was calculated . 
 the positiveness of @xmath0 indicates that the monogamy inequality is always satisfied . for our initial condition , a product state of a two - mode squeezed state of alice and bob and a coherent state of chris 
 , @xmath0 vanishes initially . 
 it becomes positive due to the effective interaction between alice and chris induced from the vacuum at intermediate time scale . in a meantime , decoherence induced from the environment causes @xmath0 to decay at long times . 
 similarly to the bipartite entanglement dynamics@xcite , the environment plays a dual role . 
 it induces multipartite entanglement among subsystems but it also is the source of decoherence and dissipation that decrease entanglement causing information loss . 
 next we studied quantum teleportation protocols between two static and one accelerated observer . 
 we first looked at the case with arbitrary final states of alice and bob by summing over all possible final states of them . 
 what we obtained is an one - mode q function for bob s state . in the long time and weak coupling limit for a zero acceleration 
 , we saw that the fidelity reaches one and there is no information loss in this case . 
 then we considered the generalized final state to which the quantum state of alice and chris projected after the measurement to be an arbitrary two - mode squeezed state with the squeezing parameter @xmath242 . 
 the time - dependent teleportation fidelity is calculated for the measure of success of quantum teleportation . 
 we showed that after performing the proper unitary transformation on bob s quantum state based on the measurement result sent to bob , the fidelity is recovered to a unit value in the limit of @xmath325 in the absence of the environment . for the generic value of @xmath326 , 
 however , the fidelity is always smaller than @xmath186 . 
 thus there is information loss even in the absence of the interaction . 
 furthermore , even if the initial state of alice and bob is maximally entangled , the fidelity is still smaller than @xmath186 for generic finite values of @xmath242 .    in the presence of the interaction with the vacuum , 
 the fidelity shows damped oscillations similarly to entanglement . 
 this indicates the close relation between entanglement and fidelity . in the absence of environment 
 , there is a direct relation between fidelity and entanglement for maximally entangled final states as seen in ( [ favps ] ) . with the generic final state in the presence of the environment , 
 the relation is not so straightforward . 
 the damping of fidelity is enhanced by the acceleration . the unruh effect overall 
 suppresses fidelity causing more information loss . 
 we obtained the fidelity expression for the maximally entangled final state case @xmath249 in ( [ favmaxfinal ] ) . 
 this type of final states is usually assumed in current experiments for quantum teleportation@xcite . 
 we saw that the temporal behavior of the fidelity consists of damped oscillations similarly to the case with generic @xmath242 . 
 the maximum value of the fidelity is achieved only at the initial time , which becomes a unit value as @xmath264 goes to infinity . 
 we also examined the case when the initial and the final state are both maximally entangled ( @xmath327 ) . in this case , the teleportation is perfect ( the fidelity reaches the unit value ) in the absence of the environment or other sources of information loss . in the presence of the interaction with vacuum , however , the fidelity is shown to decay . 
 taking the long time limit , we obtained the asymptotic value of the fidelity . 
 if we ignore the interaction of bob s state with the vacuum , we obtain @xmath328 and quantum teleportation can still be viewed as successful . 
 proper encoding of the message with quantum error correction may help retrieving the complete information . 
 if we take into account the interaction with vacuum for all three parties , we obtain @xmath329 , thus quantum teleportation is no longer successful .    implications of our results to black hole information problem can be summarized as follows . 
 there are two fundamental sources of nonunitary evolutions and information loss . 
 ( 1 ) the boundary condition of the evolution of the total system ( intrinsic loss ) . ( 2 ) 
 the interaction of the relevant quantum mechanical system with the surrounding quantum field ( induced loss ) . 
 ( 1 ) can be attributed in the laboratory to the special choice of boundary conditions imposed by measurement . 
 ( 2 ) is present in any spacetime and responsible for the quantum / classical correspondence of quantum systems of large degrees of freedom@xcite . in a black hole spacetime 
 , the singularity provides an effective boundary on the quantum state of infalling matter and the incoming hawking particle . 
 the origin of nonunitary evolution in ( 1 ) may be explained by the remnants or wormholes@xcite . 
 ( 2 ) is also present as the interaction among infalling matter , hawking particles , and gravitational field of a black hole . 
 thus in addition to the correlation in a hawking pair , there is the induced three - body correlation and tripartite entanglement between the matter and a hawking pair , which vary dynamically due to gravitational interaction . in the practical 
 setting of the laboratory , there are many other phenomenological loss of information such as photon loss during the optical transmission , leakage , etc . 
 we did not consider these effects in this work .    at the present stage without complete knowledge of quantum gravity , we do not know details about the final state of the black hole . assuming a maximally entangled final state , we may retrieve quantum information from a black hole just as in quantum teleportation as suggested in @xcite provided that ( i ) the induced loss due to vacuum is negligible . since the environment is always present , this type of loss is unavoidable . 
 ( ii ) the proper postselection is performed . 
 this can be viewed as an extension of the time - neutral formulation of quantum mechanics@xcite applied to spacetime physics , in which both initial and final states are specified . 
 decoherence history interpretation of the formulation in view of cosmology is given in @xcite . 
 in the meantime , performing the postselection in the laboratory is now very common in quantum information science . 
 we hope our attempts using accelerated observers provide a practical setting to understand the black hole information problem .

59,"network models of quantum localisation were first introduced by chalker and coddington@xcite to model the transition between plateaux in integer quantum hall systems . reduced to their essentials 
 , they describe the propagation of a single quantum - mechanical particle along the directed edges and through the nodes of a graph . for the chalker - coddington model 
 , this graph is some large but bounded domain of the l - lattice , a square lattice whose edges are directed in such a way that the particle turns through @xmath2 at each node . in propagating along each edge , 
 the single - component wave function is multiplied by random phases , which are i.i.d . 
 random variables with a uniform distribution in @xmath3 . 
 the propagation through each node is described by a unitary @xmath4 @xmath1-matrix of amplitudes between the two incoming and two outgoing edges . 
 the integer quantum hall plateau transition is only one among several possible universality classes of quantum localisation transitions , which have been classified by altland and zirnbauer@xcite according to the symmetry properties of the underlying single - particle hamiltonian @xmath5 . 
 another , known as class c , corresponds to the existence of a symmetry @xmath6 this gives rise to a pairing between eigenstates with energies @xmath7 , while @xmath8 is special and may correspond to delocalised eigenstates , even in two dimensions . 
 class c is supposed to be realised in disordered spin - singlet superconductors in which time - reversal symmetry is broken , but zeeman splitting is negligible@xcite . 
 the fact that spin is still conserved can then lead to a spin quantum hall effect . 
 the appropriate network model for this on the l - lattice was formulated and studied numerically by kagalovsky et al@xcite . 
 an equivalent spin - chain hamiltonian was also investigated by senthil et al@xcite . however , in a remarkable paper , gruzberg , ludwig and read@xcite showed that the mean single - particle green function , as well as the mean conductance , may be expressed in terms of _ classical _ averages of appropriate observables of the hulls ( boundaries ) of clusters in classical bond percolation on the square lattice . 
 the critical exponents@xcite and some other universal properties@xcite of the spin quantum hall transition in two dimensions are thus exactly known . _ _    the methods of gruzberg et al@xcite used supersymmetry to average over quenched disorder . 
 one of the essential features of this , which will also appear in our analysis , is the reduction of the hilbert space on each edge to one of finite dimension . 
 they then analysed the transfer matrix for the l - lattice , and demonstrated its equivalence to that for percolation hulls . 
 one of the interesting features of percolation hulls on the square lattice is that they may be generated , independently of the underlying percolation problem , as history - dependent random walks on the l - lattice . consider a random walk which begins on some edge , and steps through one node in unit time . at each node it turns to the left or right with probabilities @xmath9 or @xmath10 respectively . 
 however , it can not traverse a given edge more than once , so that whenever it returns to a node it has already visited it is forced to exit along the other ( empty ) edge . 
 eventually , on a closed graph , it will return to its initial edge . 
 the statistical properties of such loops are identical to those of a single closed hull in the percolation problem . on the l - lattice in the thermodynamic limit , when @xmath11 , loops close almost surely after a finite number of steps . 
 this corresponds to quantum localisation in the network model . 
 the only delocalised states occur when @xmath12 , at the bond percolation threshold .    motivated by this work , beamond , cardy and chalker@xcite investigated class c network models on arbitrary graphs . 
 their methods did not use supersymmetry . 
 instead they showed that , for quantities like the average green function @xmath13 and the mean conductance ( related to @xmath14 ) , there is a massive cancellation between paths in the feynman expansion of these quantities which leaves essentially classical paths whose weights correspond to those of a history - dependent random walk . 
 this reproduces the results of gruzberg et al@xcite when specialised to the l - lattice . 
 however , the proof of beamond et al@xcite was restricted to graphs in which each node has @xmath15 incoming and outgoing directed edges . 
 it becomes too cumbersome to generalise it to graphs with nodes with @xmath16 . 
 nevertheless , it seems important to find such a generalisation in order to be able to investigate , for example , the properties of such network models on simple regular lattices embedded in three or more dimensions . 
 in this paper , we find this generalisation . 
 like gruzberg et al@xcite , we use supersymmetry to perform the quenched average . 
 however , we do this within a path integral , rather than a hilbert space , formulation of the model , which allows for the treatment of an arbitrary graph , not only those regular lattices which admit a transfer matrix . 
 the result is positive , in the sense that we can prove that the mean of @xmath13 and of @xmath14 may be expressed as a sum of history - dependent classical random walks on the graph . 
 the weights at each node , given that a given set of incoming edges is occupied by the walk , when summed over all possible outcomes , correctly sum to unity . however , in general these weights are not positive , and therefore can not be interpreted as probabilities . 
 in fact we show that , for @xmath16 , this condition can only be satisfied if a certain number of elements of @xmath1 vanish . 
 a sufficient condition for this is that the @xmath1-matrix at each node is a direct product of @xmath1-matrices for @xmath17 nodes , that is , the node may be decomposed into @xmath17 nodes ( in which case , of course , the analysis of beamond et al@xcite applies . ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19 we have shown that this condition is also necessary .    despite this negative result , the proof of the general theorem sheds further light on the analysis of gruzberg et al@xcite , as well as giving a more elegant derivation of beamond et al@xcite . 
 these methods may also be used to determine which combinations of averages of higher - point green functions in the network model may be related to observables in the classical problem , thus giving a simpler derivation of some of the results of mirlin , evers , and mildenberger@xcite . 
 the layout of this paper is as follows . in the next section , 
 we define the network models and the observables of interest 
 . then we are able to state our main theorems ( 1 and 2 ) . in sec . 
 iii we introduce the path integral machinery necessary to compute these observables , and to perform quenched averages . 
 the supersymmetric path integral involves both bosonic ( commuting ) and fermionic ( anticommuting ) variables on each edge , but after the quenched average is taken we show that these reduce to the propagation of only single fermion - fermion or boson - fermion pairs . in sec . 
 iv we then show that the propagation of a fermion - fermion pair through the lattice obeys the rules of a classical history - dependent random walk , once all the other degrees of freedom are traced out . 
 this proves theorem 1 . 
 we also consider the case of open systems , and conductance measurements . finally , in sec . 
 v , we consider the probabilistic interpretation in terms of history - dependent random walks , and prove theorem 4 which states conditions under which these weights are non - negative . 
 let @xmath20 be a graph consisting of @xmath21 directed edges , and nodes . 
 initially we consider only closed graphs . at each node 
 there is an equal number of incoming and outgoing directed edges . 
 apart from this , @xmath22 is arbitrary . 
 we wish to define a network model on this graph with describes the propagation of a quantum - mechanical particle whose hamiltonian @xmath5 obeys the symmetry ( [ symm ] ) . 
 first we note that the single - particle hilbert space must be even - dimensional in order to be able to define the action of @xmath23 . for simplicity 
 we take this to be two - dimensional ( in @xcite a method was proposed for reducing any class c network model with an even - dimensional single - particle hilbert space to this case . ) 
 since the network describes propagation over finite time steps @xmath24 , we need to define the unitary evolution operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 which evolve the wave function along each edge and node respectively . by ( [ symm ] ) 
 , they must obey @xmath27 . 
 each @xmath25 , therefore , must be an element of sp(2)@xmath28su(2 ) . 
 we take these to be i.i.d . 
 random variables , each uniformly distributed with respect to the haar measure of su(2 ) 
 . quenched averages with respect to this measure will be denoted by an overline . 
 @xmath26 is the unitary @xmath1-matrix for the node @xmath29 . 
 as will become clear , it suffices to take this to be diagonal in the su(2 ) indices , so , by the above , it must be real and therefore an element of o@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of incoming ( and outgoing ) edges at the node . 
 the @xmath26 may vary from node to node , and in principle they may also be random variables . 
 however , our theorems apply to a fixed realisation of these @xmath1-matrix elements . 
 the full unitary evolution operator @xmath32 for the whole network is then a direct sum over the edges and nodes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . 
 of interest is the green function , which is the matrix element of the resolvent operator @xmath35 between states localised on two edges : @xmath36 this is a @xmath4 matrix in su(2 ) space . for @xmath37 this may be expanded as a sum of feynman paths on @xmath20 beginning at @xmath38 and ending at @xmath39 : each path is weighted by an ordered product of su(2 ) matrices @xmath25 along the edges is traverses , and a product of @xmath1-matrix elements according to how it passes through each node , as well as a factor @xmath40 raised to the power of its length . however 
 , each edge may be traversed an arbitrary number of times . 
 if we were to formulate the sum over such paths using a transfer matrix formalism ( assuming that @xmath22 allows this ) , the hilbert space on each edge would be infinite - dimensional .    alternatively , for @xmath41 , we may write the resolvent as @xmath42 and expand @xmath13 in powers of @xmath43 , as a similar sum over paths . each path 
 is now weighted by an ordered product of factors @xmath44 , as well as an overall factor of @xmath45 . 
 the green function may be used to compute the density of states of @xmath46 via its diagonal elements @xmath47 . for a closed graph , these are of the form @xmath48 . 
 we define the density of states @xmath49 
 . then @xmath50    an open system may be defined by cutting open a subset of the edges of @xmath20 . 
 we may then perform a conductance measurement by attaching leads to a subset @xmath51 of the incoming edges , and to a subset @xmath52 of the outgoing edges . 
 the transmission matrix @xmath53 between these two leads has elements @xmath54 , and the conductance is then given by the landauer formula as @xmath55 . 
 in particular , the point conductance between two edges is @xmath56 . 
 the above defines the quantum problem which we wish to study . 
 our main theorems will relate it to a classical problem , defined as follows . for each node in @xmath20 , adopt an arbitrary but fixed labelling of the incoming edges @xmath57 and outgoing edges @xmath58 , and denote the elements of the corresponding @xmath1-matrix by @xmath59 . 
 note that @xmath60 , with the sign being dependent on the choice of labelling . 
 @xmath61 on @xmath20 as a sequence of distinct edges @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are incoming and outgoing edges of the same node , for each @xmath65 . 
 it is a ( rooted ) closed trail if @xmath66 and @xmath38 also share the same node . 
 note that a trail can not pass along a given edge more than once , but it may pass through a given node any number of times , up to its order . _ 
 _    for a particular trail @xmath61 , and a particular node @xmath29 , denote the set of incoming edges on @xmath61 by @xmath67 , and the set of outgoing edges by @xmath68 . 
 these are both _ ordered _ subsets of @xmath69 . a given trail associates an element of @xmath68 with each element of @xmath67 , and vice versa , and 
 thus may be associated with a permutation @xmath70 of the ordered elements of @xmath67 . 
 denote the signature of this by @xmath71 . 
 let @xmath72 denote the minor of @xmath1 restricted to the ordered subsets @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the outgoing and incoming channels respectively . _ _ 
 we are now ready to state    * theorem 1 . * _ the mean of @xmath75 vanishes if @xmath76 , while in the case of equality it is given by @xmath77 where the sums are over all closed trails @xmath78 rooted at @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the weight of each , given by the product over all the nodes on @xmath78 of factors @xmath81 _    note that the first two factors are the term in the expansion of @xmath82 corresponding to the permutation @xmath70 : if we were to sum ( [ weight ] ) over all permutations , we would obtain @xmath83 . 
 ( [ weight ] ) is a generalisation of the main result of @xcite , which applies to the case @xmath15 . in this case 
 , the elements of @xmath1 may be taken to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 . if @xmath86 and @xmath87 , or if @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the weight is @xmath90 . if @xmath86 and @xmath89 , or if @xmath88 and @xmath87 , it is @xmath91 . 
 but if @xmath92 and @xmath93 or @xmath94 , it is unity . 
 the next theorem gives the equivalent result for conductance measurements . 
 * theorem 2 . * 
 _ the mean point conductance @xmath95 between two edges @xmath96 and @xmath97 is given by twice the sum over all open trails on @xmath20 connecting the two edges , each such path being weighted as for the closed loops in theorem 1 . 
 _    thus , if the weights on the trails can be interpreted as a probability measure , the mean conductance between two contacts is just twice the expected number of open trails which connect them . 
 the weight for a single trail @xmath61 is given by a product of weights corresponding to each node thorough which @xmath61 passes , once the whole of @xmath61 is given . 
 alternatively , we may build up these weights as a product of factors incurred each time @xmath61 passes through a given node . 
 for example , the first time it passes through , entering via edge @xmath98 and leaving by edge 
 @xmath99 it incurs a weight , according to ( [ weight ] ) , of @xmath100 . 
 if it passes though the same node again , this time entering along @xmath101 and leaving along @xmath102 , it then incurs a conditional weight . 
 if the conditional weight can be interpreted as a probability , @xmath103 and therefore it has a finite limit as @xmath104 . 
 even if this is not the case , the unconditional weight @xmath105 vanishes in this limit . ] 
 @xmath106 and so on . in general @xmath107 the next theorem states that these conditional weights are properly normalised , in the sense that they give unity when summed over all possible outcomes :    * theorem 3 . 
 * _ the weights @xmath108 satisfy @xmath109 _ 
 thus , as long as they are non - negative , they define a set of transition probabilities for a discrete random process whereby the ensemble of trails may be dynamically generated with the correct weights , the trail growing by one unit at each time step . since the weights at a given node depend on whether ( and how ) it has been visited in the past , the process may be thought of as a history - dependent random walk . 
 when all nodes have @xmath15 , this is straightforward : the first time @xmath61 passes through a given node , it incurs a factor @xmath90 or @xmath91 . if it passes through a second time , this factor is unmodified . 
 we may ask whether this positivity can extend to nodes with @xmath110 . to answer this , 
 we need a notion of reducibility . 
 the @xmath1-matrix at a node with @xmath110 is said to be _ 
 reducible _ if it admits a factorisation of the form @xmath111 , where ( after a possible re - ordering of the incoming and outgoing channel labels ) the @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 matrices have the block diagonal forms @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are orthogonal @xmath118 and @xmath119 matrices respectively , and @xmath120 . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ reduce ] . _ 
 _    this procedure may be repeated . 
 an @xmath112 @xmath1-matrix is said to be _ completely reducible _ if it can be factorised in this way into @xmath17 @xmath1-matrices . 
 _ _    * theorem 4 . * _ at a node with @xmath110 , a sufficient condition for the weights ( [ weight ] ) to be all non - negative is that the @xmath1-matrix is completely reducible . for @xmath18 and @xmath19 
 this is also necessary . 
 _ thus , in these cases , the network model on @xmath20 could have been described on an equivalent graph with only @xmath15 nodes . 
 in the standard way , @xmath13 may be written as a path integral over commuting ( bosonic ) variables . 
 the notation is a little complicated , but the basic idea is simple . 
 label each end of a given directed edge @xmath79 by @xmath121 and @xmath122 , in the direction of propagation @xmath123 . 
 introduce complex integration variables @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are each 2-component column vectors in su(2 ) space , their components being labelled @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively , where @xmath128 . 
 then @xmath13 can be written as @xmath129[d{b}_r(e)]{b}_l(e_2){b}_l^{\dag}(e_1)\,e^{w_b } \over \int\prod_e[d{b}_l(e)][d{b}_r(e)]\,e^{w_b}}\ ] ] where @xmath130 with @xmath131 and the integration is wrt the usual coherent state measure @xmath132=(1/\pi^2)\int e^{-{b}^{\dag}{b}}\prod_ad{\rm re}\,{b}_a\,d{\rm im}\,{b}_a\ ] ] note that there is a finite number of integrations , if @xmath20 is finite , and that no time - ordering necessary : we can imagine writing everything out in terms of components , and all quantities in the path integral are commuting . on a finite graph , 
 only a finite number of integrations is necessary . 
 the exponentiation of @xmath133 correctly takes into account the multiple traversing of edges by feynman paths . 
 the next step is to average over the quenched random variables @xmath25 . as usual , since these occur in both the numerator and denominator , this is most easily done either by introducing replicas , or by adding an anticommuting ( fermionic ) copy of the bosonic variables , making it supersymmetric . 
 we opt for the latter . 
 thus to each pair of complex integration variables @xmath134 we introduce a pair of grassmann variables @xmath135 with corresponding labels , and we add to @xmath133 a term @xmath136 of identical form with bosonic variables replaced by fermionic ones . 
 the grassmann integration is defined by @xmath137=\int d\bar{f } d{f } e^{-\bar{f}{f}}\ ] ] so that @xmath138{f}=\int[d{f}]\bar{f}&=&0;\\ \int[d{f}]\,1=\int[d{f}]{f}\bar{f}&=&1\end{aligned}\ ] ]    integrating over the fermionic variables cancels the denominator in ( [ nd ] ) , so that we may write @xmath139[d{b}_r(e)][d{f}_l(e)][d{f}_r(e ) ] { b}_l(e_2){b}_l^{\dag}(e_1)e^{w_b+w_f}\ ] ] however , @xmath140 is invariant under global supersymmetry , so @xmath13 may equally well be expressed , for example , as @xmath141 . 
 the average over the su(2 ) matrix @xmath142 on a given edge has the form @xmath143 where the integral is with respect to the invariant measure on su(2 ) , normalised so that @xmath144 . 
 * lemma 1 : * _ the above integral equals @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the @xmath4 matrix with components @xmath147 . 
 _ _ _    _ proof : _ because the fermionic variables have only two components , and any such component squares to zero , the expansion in the fermionic part terminates : @xmath148 the first term , the purely bosonic integral , is identically equal to unity . 
 this follows from the observation that the integral is invariant under the substitutions @xmath149 , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are independent su(2 ) matrices , and @xmath153 is a complex number , and there is no combination of @xmath154 and @xmath155 which has this property , save a constant . 
 however , an explicit proof is given in appendix a.    the third , purely fermionic , term is also easy : @xmath156 where the fourth line follows because @xmath157 . 
 the expression is therefore independent of @xmath142 , and the integration is then the same as in the purely bosonic term , which gives a factor 1 as before . 
 the second term can also be worked out explicitly , but it easier to invoke the supersymmetry , and simply add @xmath158 to each element @xmath159 of the above matrix . 
 note that the purely bosonic part of the determinant vanishes . 
 the result of the quenched average over the su(2 ) matrix on a given edge is therefore @xmath160 the interpretation of this is clear : after averaging over the su(2 ) matrices , the only paths which contribute are those in which on each edge the allowed propagation is of either the identity , a pair of fermions @xmath161 , or a boson - fermion pair @xmath162 . 
 note that in each case the combinations in parentheses above are su(2 ) singlets . note also that , having averaged over the edge variables @xmath25 , the distinction between @xmath163 and @xmath164 is now immaterial , and we can henceforth drop these labels . 
 the above result has several important consequences . 
 first , there is now only a finite number @xmath165 of possibilities for propagation along the @xmath21 edges of a finite graph @xmath20 . 
 ( this is equivalent to the result of gruzberg et al@xcite that the hilbert space of the transfer matrix is finite - dimensional . ) 
 second , it is clear why the assumption that the scattering at the nodes in diagonal in the su(2 ) indices was not crucial : only the singlet invariant amplitude matters . 
 third , the only non - zero two - point functions with @xmath166 are @xmath167    let us for the moment take @xmath40 real . 
 then @xmath168 , as a sum over feynman paths , is a linear combination of su(2 ) matrices with real coefficients . 
 any such @xmath4 matrix is itself proportional to an su(2 ) matrix , up to a real scalar ( see appendix . ) 
 thus we may write @xmath169 where @xmath153 is real and @xmath170 su(2 ) 
 . hence @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , so that @xmath173 . 
 the right hand side is a polynomial in @xmath40 . 
 for general complex @xmath40 we have , therefore , @xmath174 when @xmath175 this is the mean point conductance , which is therefore given , up to a factor 2 , by the two - point functions in ( [ 2pt ] ) . 
 since only su@xmath0 singlets now propagate , it follows that two - point functions like @xmath176 vanish if @xmath166 . 
 this is because , once the matrices @xmath25 have been traced out , the supersymmetric path integral possesses a _ 
 su(2 ) gauge invariance under @xmath177 with @xmath178 su(2 ) . _ _ 
 however , this does not apply if @xmath179 . 
 in fact , because of ( [ 2pt ] ) , it follows that @xmath180 
 in the last section , we showed that , for a graph @xmath20 with @xmath21 edges , the quenched average of the path integral can be written as a sum of @xmath165 terms , according to which of the three terms in ( [ prop ] ) ( corresponding to the propagation of a @xmath181 pair , an @xmath182 pair , or the identity ) is chosen on each edge . 
 let us now consider just one of these terms , and one particular node . 
 the contribution to the path integral from this node has the form @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 and @xmath187    in doing this , we have brought together in the path integral all the factors associated with the given node . 
 there is a subtlety , however , because the boson - fermion variables @xmath188 and @xmath189 anticommute with each other . at a given node 
 , we may arrange these factors in the standard order determined by the fixed ( but arbitrary ) labelling of the incoming and outgoing edges . for a given term out of the @xmath165 possibilities , this will introduce an overall factor @xmath190 .    define a _ 
 decomposition _ of the node as a pairing of each outgoing edges @xmath191 with a unique incoming edge @xmath192 . 
 this defines a permutation @xmath193 of the edge labels , whereby the outgoing edge @xmath191 paired with the incoming edge @xmath192 is @xmath194 . 
 carried through for every node in turn , this decomposes @xmath20 into a union of disjoint directed closed loops ( and open paths if @xmath20 is open ) , such that every edge lies on just one loop or open path , and each loop or open path may pass along a given edge no more than once . 
 the following proposition shows that we are allowed to do this inside the path integral , as long as we weight each decomposition correctly : _ _ 
 * proposition 1 . * _ the result of performing the integration over the variables @xmath195 and @xmath196 in ( [ asa ] ) is the same as if @xmath197 were replaced by @xmath198 that is , it is given by a weighted sum over all decompositions @xmath193 . in each decomposition , each state on the incoming edge @xmath192 propagates freely to @xmath194 . _ _ _    _ proof : _ since the numbers of each component of both bosons and fermions are the same in the incoming and outgoing channels , and bosons are always paired with fermions , it follows that the numbers of @xmath182 and @xmath199 pairs are individually conserved at every node . 
 let us call the subsets of the @xmath31 outgoing channels occupied by an @xmath182 pair , a @xmath181 pair , or empty , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , respectively , and similarly for the incoming channels , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 . 
 the integrations may now be performed , expanding @xmath197 to second order in the @xmath59 and using wick s theorem . 
 each fermion ( boson ) in outgoing channel @xmath191 , when contracted with a fermion ( boson ) in the incoming channel @xmath192 , gives ( up to a sign ) a factor @xmath206 . 
 the bosons in @xmath201 may only contract onto the bosons in @xmath204 , but the complication is that some of the fermions in @xmath200 may contract onto fermions in @xmath204 , and some of those in @xmath201 may contract onto those in @xmath203 . 
 however , every set of possible contractions will involve each outgoing channel in @xmath207 and each incoming channel in @xmath208 exactly twice . 
 thus , if @xmath209 denotes a permutation of the channels in @xmath207 , then , the general form of the result will be @xmath210 where the @xmath211 are numerical coefficients . 
 we have already introduced the notation @xmath72 for the minor of @xmath1 restricted to the ordered subsets @xmath73 and @xmath74 of outgoing and incoming channels . 
 now define @xmath212 to be the corresponding permanent , that is , with all the terms having the same sign @xmath213 . 
 then the claim is that the result of the integration is @xmath214 this expression has the correct properties in that : ( a ) each channel index appears exactly twice in each term ; ( b ) @xmath59 with @xmath215 and @xmath216 ( and also with @xmath217 and @xmath218 occurs at most once ; ( c ) it is symmetric under permutations of the channels in @xmath200 , and separately in @xmath203 ; ( d ) it is antisymmetric under permutations of the channels in @xmath201 , and separately in @xmath204 ; and ( e ) it has the correct overall numerical coefficient .    in order to prove ( [ ddd ] ) , it is helpful first to consider what happens if each su(2 ) singlet @xmath219 is replaced by @xmath220 ( and similarly for the conjugate variables in the incoming channels . ) in that case , the result follows immediately . 
 the @xmath221 with @xmath215 can contract only onto the @xmath222 with @xmath218 , giving the first factor in ( [ ddd ] ) . 
 similarly , the @xmath223 with @xmath217 can contract only onto the @xmath224 with @xmath225 , giving the second factor . 
 finally the @xmath226 are free to contract onto any of the @xmath227 , leading to the last factor . 
 the reason that this result continues to hold when each @xmath220 is replaced by the singlet combination is the local gauge invariance already alluded to : we could imagine multiplying the whole amplitude by an independent su(2 ) matrix in each channel , and averaging over this . 
 the final result , being gauge invariant , would not change , but it would project @xmath220 onto the singlet combination . 
 we now need the following property of o@xmath30 matrices :    * lemma 2 . * _ if @xmath228 , and @xmath229 and @xmath230 are complementary minors of @xmath1 , then @xmath231 . 
 _ _ _    _ proof : _ this relies on the fact that if @xmath232 has rank @xmath9 , and @xmath233 is a tensor of rank @xmath9 , then @xmath234 ( where @xmath235 is the levi - civita symbol ) transforms under proper rotations as a tensor of rank @xmath236 , and changes sign under parity .    in our case 
 this implies that @xmath237 , so that ( [ ddd ] ) reads @xmath238 now look at ( [ sameas ] ) , inserted into the path integral instead of @xmath197 . 
 the kronecker deltas which conserve the labels @xmath239 restrict the sum over permutations @xmath193 to those which map @xmath203 onto some permutation @xmath240 of @xmath200 , @xmath204 onto some permutation @xmath241 of @xmath201 , and so on . 
 the signature @xmath242 decomposes into a product of the signatures of the three permutations . 
 now , since the @xmath182 pairs propagate freely ( and they commute among themselves ) , the integrations over these variables give unity . 
 the sum over @xmath240 is therefore @xmath243 , which gives the first factor in ( [ dddd ] ) . 
 although the @xmath181 pairs also propagate freely , they are fermionic , which mens that their contractions give rise to an extra factor @xmath244 . on summing over all @xmath241 
 , we get the second factor in ( [ dddd ] ) . 
 the remaining factors of @xmath245 , with @xmath246 , when summed over @xmath247 , give the last factor .    we have shown the equivalence of the two expressions @xmath197 and ( [ sameas ] ) at each node , for each of the @xmath165 terms in the expansion of the path integral . 
 we may now restore the anticommuting @xmath181 factors to their original ordering in the path integral , thus removing the possible overall sign . 
 this concludes the proof of prop .  1 . 
 first consider the case when @xmath20 is closed . in sec . 
 iii it was shown that @xmath248 is given by the correlation function @xmath249 in the supersymmetric path integral . by the results of the previous section , 
 this is given by a sum of terms in which each edge except @xmath79 is occupied by either an @xmath182 pair , a @xmath181 pair , or the identity ( and @xmath79 is occupied only by an @xmath182 pair . 
 ) moreover , the path integral is given by a sum of terms , each corresponding to a decomposition of @xmath20 into closed loops . 
 along all but one of the closed loops can freely propagate an @xmath182 pair , giving an overall factor + 1 , an @xmath181 pair , giving -1 , or the identity , giving + 1 . 
 the first two contributions cancel , leaving a factor + 1 for each of these closed loops . 
 the exception is the unique loop which contains the edge @xmath79 , which can be thought of as a closed trail @xmath78 , rooted at @xmath79 . along this only an @xmath182 pair 
 is allowed to propagate . 
 now sum over all decompositions of @xmath20 which contain the specified trail @xmath78 . at a given node @xmath29 
 , @xmath78 occupies the incoming edges @xmath67 and the outgoing edges @xmath68 . 
 the sum in ( [ sameas ] ) includes only those permutations @xmath193 for which @xmath250 is some permutation of @xmath68 . 
 this implies that @xmath193 acting on the complementary subset @xmath251 is some permutation @xmath252 of the complement @xmath253 . 
 if we now sum the factors of @xmath59 in ( [ sameas ] ) with @xmath254 and @xmath255 over the permutations @xmath252 , weighted by @xmath256 , we get @xmath257 . using lemma 2 again , 
 this equals @xmath258 . 
 the latter factor of @xmath259 combines with explicit one in ( [ sameas ] ) to give unity . 
 the remaining factors then give the weight ( [ weight ] ) of the node @xmath29 on the trail @xmath78 . 
 this proves theorem 1 . 
 theorem 2 follows similarly . for an open graph , @xmath260 is given by a sum of decompositions of @xmath20 as before , into closed loops as well as open paths which connect the incoming and outgoing external edges . along 
 these propagate either @xmath182 pairs , @xmath181 pairs , or the identity , with weights at each node given by ( [ sameas ] ) . in each decomposition 
 , there is a unique open trail @xmath61 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , carrying an @xmath182 pair . 
 the other open paths must carry the identity , otherwise the path integration over the free bosonic and fermionic variables at their ends would give zero . 
 they therefore contribute a factor 1 . 
 all the other closed loops also contribute a factor 1 after the cancellation between the @xmath182 and @xmath181 pairs which propagate around each of them . 
 we are left with a single @xmath182 pair propagating along @xmath61 . 
 the summation over all the decompositions of @xmath20 containing a given open trail @xmath61 then gives a factor @xmath258 at each node as above . 
 this proves theorem 2 . 
 we now prove theorem 3 , which states that the weights @xmath261 in theorem 1 lead , if non - negative , through ( [ cond ] ) to correctly normalised transition probabilities @xmath262 for the trail @xmath78 interpreted as a classical random walk on the edges of @xmath20 . 
 a necessary and sufficient condition for this is @xmath263 without loss of generality , we may relabel the rows and columns of @xmath1 so that @xmath264 for @xmath265 , and @xmath266 for @xmath267 . 
 notice that we can remove the restriction on the sum over @xmath268 because the summand formally vanishes whenever @xmath269 . 
 the index @xmath268 occurs on the left hand side of ( [ nsc ] ) in the factor @xmath270 as well as in each term of the expansion of the minor @xmath271 , where it occurs as @xmath272 with @xmath267 . 
 thus the sum over @xmath268 , in each term in the expansion of the determinant , has the form @xmath273 , from the orthonormality of the rows of @xmath1 . 
 the coefficient of this term is just the subminor @xmath274 which occurs on the right hand side of ( [ nsc ] ) . 
 all the remaining factors @xmath275 are the same on both sides . 
 this demonstrates the validity of ( [ nsc ] ) and thus theorem 3 . 
 although we have argued that the weights @xmath276 appearing in theorem 1 are normalised , they may only be interpreted as probabilities if they are all non - negative . 
 this places strong constraints on the @xmath1-matrix at each node .    taking first the case 
 when the sets @xmath73 and @xmath74 comprise all the outgoing and incoming edges of the node , we see that the weights are all non - negative if and only if every term in the expansion of @xmath259 has the same sign , or vanishes . 
 in fact , this is also a sufficient condition for all the weights to be non - negative when @xmath73 and @xmath74 are proper subsets . 
 this is because , by lemma 2 , @xmath72 is , up to a factor @xmath60 , the same as its conjugate minor , and therefore each term in ( [ weight ] ) is , up to an overall sign , a sum of a subset of terms in the expansion of @xmath259 . 
 they therefore all have the same sign , or vanish , if this is true of the individual terms in the expansion .    for @xmath15 , 
 this is always the case . if @xmath277 , we can write @xmath278 , so that the terms in the expansion are @xmath279 ; or if @xmath280 we can write @xmath281 , in which case they are @xmath282 . however , for an orthogonal matrix with @xmath16 , this constraint becomes nontrivial . 
 consider first the case @xmath18 . 
 it is elementary to show that if the @xmath283 terms in the expansion of the determinant of _ any _ @xmath284 matrix all have the sign ( or vanish ) then there must be at least one vanishing element . for 
 consider the _ product _ of all these terms . 
 this contains each element @xmath59 exactly twice . 
 there are six terms in all , and three of these , corresponding to the odd permutations , occur with minus signs . 
 hence the product of all the terms is @xmath285 
 . this would be impossible if all the @xmath59 were non - vanishing . 
 _ _ _ _    now any o(3 ) rotation can be composed of three suitable o(2 ) rotations about different axes , for example through the euler angles . 
 this composition may , in general , be pictured using a diagram like that in fig . 
 [ euler ] . 
 each intersection of lines labelled by @xmath191 and @xmath192 corresponds to an o(2 ) rotation in the @xmath286 plane , represented by an o(2 ) matrix @xmath287 with @xmath288 . 
 the element @xmath59 of the full o(3 ) matrix is given by a sum over directed paths from @xmath192 to @xmath191 in the diagram , each path being weighted by a product of the appropriate o(2 ) matrix elements . 
 for example , @xmath289 each topologically distinct way of drawing and labelling fig . 
 [ euler ] corresponds to a different but equivalent euler angle parametrisation . 
 we can always draw the diagram so that the matrix element which vanishes by the above argument ( in this example @xmath290 ) is given by a simple form like ( [ simple ] ) . 
 this implies that @xmath291 , and therefore that @xmath292 ( note that @xmath293 can always be chosen as a proper rotation . ) 
 this means that we can picture the lines 1 and 3 simply crossing at the vertex ( 2 ) , and that the full o(3 ) rotation reduces into a product of just two o(2 ) rotations , as in the definition ( [ red ] ) of reducibility . 
 an o@xmath30 matrix has several distinct but equivalent euler angle representations as a composition of @xmath295 o@xmath0 rotations , which may be pictured using a generalisation of fig.[euler ] . 
 an example for @xmath296 is shown in fig . 
 [ euler4 ] . 
 in such a diagram any given line intersects each of the others exactly once . 
 if the matrix is completely reducible there is at least one representation which has a tree structure , that is , contains no cycles . 
 an example is shown in fig .  [ euler4 ] . 
 in this case , many elements of @xmath1 must vanish , and those which do not are each given by a single term which is a product of o@xmath0 matrix elements along a single possible path through the diagram . 
 complete reducibility is a sufficient condition for the weights in ( [ weight ] ) all to be non - negative . 
 one way to see this is to note that we can in this case decompose the node into a tree of @xmath17 nodes . 
 the internal edges of this tree can be made to carry an arbitrary su@xmath0 matrix , which can however always be set equal to 1 by making a gauge transformation on the su@xmath0 matrices on the incoming and outgoing edges of the node ( this is not always possible if there are cycles . ) 
 we may therefore introduce such matrices on each internal edge of the tree and integrate over them without changing the problem . 
 thus the weights for the node are products of weights for @xmath17 nodes , which we have already argued are always non - negative . 
 next we consider whether this condition is necessary . 
 consider the terms in the expansion of @xmath259 which contain a factor @xmath297 . 
 the coefficient of this term is the @xmath284 minor @xmath72 with @xmath298 . 
 the above lemma about @xmath284 matrices then shows that either this submatrix has at least one vanishing element , or the product @xmath299 vanishes . in general 
 , every @xmath284 submatrix of @xmath1 must have at least one vanishing element , or every term in the expansion of its complementary minor must vanish .    for @xmath296 
 , this implies that there must be at least 3 vanishing elements , not all in the same row or column . by considering the different cases , together with a suitably chosen euler angle representation , 
 it is possible to show that in each case a sufficient number of the o@xmath0 matrix elements must vanish that the diagram breaks up into a tree . 
 this shows that , for @xmath296 , the condition of complete reducibility is also necessary for non - negative weights . 
 however , we have not found a general argument for all @xmath31 and indeed there may be exceptions . what can be shown straightforwardly 
 is that @xmath1 must have at least @xmath300 vanishing elements .    _

60,"direct observation of the cosmic ray electronic component ( which includes both electrons and positrons with no charge discrimination ) dates back to the early 1960s , and since that time , the energy range and the sensitivity of the observations have increased systematically . to date , we have at hand data from three new instruments , fermi @xcite , hess @xcite@xcite , and atic @xcite , that have the requisite sensitivity to measure , with good statistical accuracy , the spectrum of the total electronic component ( @xmath1 ) well into the tev region . 
 the reported spectrum in the region @xmath210 gev is parameterized as [ eq : spect ] f_t(e)=e^- with @xmath3 up to @xmath0 1 tev , and the value of @xmath4 increases to @xmath0 3.9 at higher energies . 
 we reproduce in fig . 
 [ fig : hess ] their observations and a compilation of the results of other measurements . 
 the spectral slope below 10 gev progressively flattens to a slope of @xmath01.7 . 
 uncertainties in the fluxes are introduced due to solar modulation effects below an energy of a few gev . 
 we also show , in the same figure , a smooth fit to all the data that we adopt for some of the calculations .        the electronic component in cosmic rays , 
 because of its interactions with radiation fields such as starlight , the microwave background , and magnetic fields in the galaxy , has been particularly useful in understanding the origins and propagation of energetic particles in the galaxy @xcite . 
 this and other early considerations of the effects on the spectral shape of the cosmic ray electrons were carried out in the context of a smooth distribution of cosmic ray sources in the galaxy , and the transport was described within the framework of the leaky box model @xcite . 
 there were also attempts to calculate the flux of nuclear secondaries like li , be , and b , as well as positrons , in cosmic rays within the context of a nested leaky box model which took into consideration the effects of storage of cosmic rays in a small bubble surrounding the compact sources of cosmic rays @xcite@xcite . 
 the key consideration for this model was the anisotropy of cosmic rays at high energies . 
 if the residence time of cosmic rays in the galaxy reduced with energy to accommodate the decreasing ratio of secondary to primary nuclei in cosmic rays , then the expected anisotropy would increase correspondingly at high energies . 
 the recent observations of positrons in cosmic rays by pamela @xcite has created much excitement because of the possible connection of these observations with annihilation of dark matter in the galaxy . 
 their observations of the ratio @xmath5 , of positrons to the total electronic component in cosmic rays is reproduced in fig . 
 [ fig : pamela ] . the positron fraction at @xmath01.64 gev was measured to be @xmath00.0673 , which decreases to @xmath00.0483 at @xmath06.83 gev and thereupon increases monotonically , reaching a value of 0.137 at a mean energy of 82.55 gev . 
 it is this monotonic increase that is being called anomalous , as it does not conform to the prediction of the currently popular model of the cosmic ray propagation @xcite@xcite . 
 accordingly , this paper begins with a review of the cosmic ray propagation models . 
 the pamela measurements are to be viewed in the context of the measurements of the total electronic component and a compilation of the available data as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : hess ] .    the cosmic ray nucleonic component is dominated by protons with some neutrons coming in bound as he and other nuclei . 
 the nucleon spectrum may be represented as f_n(e)=_ne^-where @xmath6 ( we adopt @xmath7 ) in the energy region 1 gev / nucleon to @xmath010@xmath8 gev / nucleon beyond which the slope may increase to @xmath03 . 
 the @xmath9 ratio effectively determines the @xmath10 ratio generated by cosmic rays through interactions with matter in the sources and the interstellar medium through which they propagate before they leak out of the galaxy . 
 the theoretical calculation of @xmath10 generated through nuclear interaction of cosmic ray nuclei yield @xmath02 @xcite . on the other hand , 
 the observations of the @xmath11 ratio in cosmic rays gives @xmath121.3 @xcite . 
 we show our results for both of these values for the secondary positrons and electrons .    in section 
 ii , we provide a brief overview of the models for cosmic ray propagation , and in section iii , we discuss the pamela results , first in a model independent way , and then compare it with the expectations of the various models . 
 finally , section iv is devoted to a discussion of the main results of this paper and related matters . 
 it should be noted that much work as has been done recently to explain the pamela data in terms of dark matter , pulsars , supernova remnants , and other astrophysical objects . instead of listing the many papers which address these issues 
 , we refer the reader to @xcite which contains references to many recent works . 
 it is generally accepted that cosmic rays are accelerated in a large number of discrete sources distributed in the galaxy , and the cosmic rays propagate from these sources moving along randomly oriented trajectories , akin to diffusion , until they leak away from the galaxy . during such a propagation 
 , the cosmic rays might interact with the interstellar matter , the radiation , and magnetic fields . 
 any secondaries generated through such interactions , if charged , will be confined by the interstellar magnetic fields and will therefore follow the same kind of random paths as the primaries before escaping from the galaxy . 
 the various propagation models are characterized by the specific form chosen for the `` vacuum path length distribution '' @xcite which describes the probability @xmath13 that the cosmic rays spend in any given region , such as a cocoon surrounding the sources , or in the general interstellar medium before escaping into the intergalactic space . 
 the term `` vacuum '' emphasizes the fact that in specifying @xmath13 , one considers hypothetical particles which do not suffer interactions or lose energy during propagation . 
 the effects of these processes are to be added later on .      in its simplest original form @xcite 
 , one assumes that @xmath13 has a broad distribution with significant amplitude near @xmath14 , exemplified by a simple exponential function p(t)=e^-t/ where @xmath15 is called the escape lifetime of the cosmic rays . in the original version , 
 @xmath15 was assumed to be sensibly independent of energy beyond @xmath01 - 2 gev . thereafter 
 , since the discovery that the ratio of the fluxes of secondary cosmic ray nuclei to those of the primaries was a decreasing function of energy , @xmath15 was considered to decrease with energy to accommodate the observations . 
 we summarize in figs . 
 [ fig : bc ] and [ fig : sc ] the available observations . the crucial issue here is how @xmath15 behaves at energies beyond 10 - 20 gev where the observations have low statistical significance or are non - existent at much higher energies . 
 most conventional models today @xcite@xcite assume that [ eq : taua]_a(e)~_0e^-for  e>2gev / n  ( model  a)with @xmath16 . 
 such an extrapolation to high energies is shown in a dot - dashed line in figs . 
 [ fig : bc ] and [ fig : sc ] . 
 alternatively , we may assume that @xmath17 becomes nearly constant at high energies . 
 b(e)~_a(e ) & for  e<10gev + _ 
 b(e)~_g~  constant & for  e10gev    }  ( model  b)this is shown as a solid line in figs . 
 [ fig : bc ] and [ fig : sc ] . 
 the latter form of @xmath18 at high energies predicts a lower level of anisotropy of cosmic rays compared to an ever decreasing @xmath19 . 
 we will refer to the two models described briefly here as leaky box model a and leaky box model b respectively . 
 an alternate way of accommodating the falling secondary to primary ratio is in the context of the nested leaky box model @xcite . 
 here , one assumes that subsequent to acceleration , cosmic rays spend some time in a cocoon - like region surrounding the sources , interacting with the matter there to generate some of the secondaries at lower energies . 
 the residence time @xmath20 in the source region is energy dependant , decreasing with increasing energy . on the other hand , 
 once these cosmic rays enter the general interstellar medium , their subsequent transport becomes independent of energy and the residence time becomes equal to @xmath21 . . 
 ll _ s(e)~_b(e)-_g & for  1  gev < e<10  gev + _ g(e)~  constant & for  1  gev < e<10 ^ 6  gev    }  ( model  c).the net effect of the interactions in these two regimes is to generate the correct ratio of the fluxes of secondary nuclei to those of their primaries .    in this model , 
 the anisotropies of cosmic ray fluxes remain constant and do not increase with energy . 
 moreover , the spectrum of cosmic ray primaries , say the nuclear component , is more easily understood . to see this , 
 let @xmath22 represent the injection rate of cosmic rays into the galactic volume per unit volume and unit time at energy @xmath23 per unit energy interval : s_n(e)~e^-.the spectrum @xmath24 expected in the galaxy is given by f_n(e)~_gs_n(e)~_ge^-.on the other hand , in the simple leaky box model a , @xmath25 which will fit the observations for the choice @xmath26 with the sources accelerating a flatter spectrum than the one that is observed . 
 this flatter spectrum must continue up to very high energies , up to which the residence time continues to decrease as @xmath27 . 
 if such a rapid decrease of residence time stops at any energy and becomes constant , then @xmath24 will display @xmath28 behavior at higher energies , or until @xmath22 itself changes its slope .    in the leaky - box model 
 b , the source function @xmath22 should have an index @xmath29=2.2 at @xmath30 gev / n , which changes to @xmath31 at @xmath32 gev , coincident with the change in behavior of @xmath33 , compensating its change and generating a smooth power law for @xmath24 . 
 thus , in the nested leaky box model , the observed spectral slopes simply correspond to that generated in the acceleration process in the cosmic ray sources . 
 also , with constant @xmath21 , the expected anisotropies do not increase with increasing energies , but remain sensibly constant . 
 the generation of electrons and positrons in the interactions of the cosmic ray nuclear component occurs through the production of mesons , mainly pions , which decay to muons which in turn decay into electrons or positrons , transferring , on the average , a fraction of about 0.05 of the energy per nucleon of the primary . 
 this is in contrast with the production of secondary nuclei , such as boron from the collision of carbon nuclei , where boron emerges with almost the same energy per nucleon as the primary carbon nucleus . 
 this difference in their production characteristics leads to nearly identical source spectra @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the secondary electrons and positrons @xmath36 in all the three models : a , b , and c.    on the other hand , their equilibrium spectra @xmath37 and @xmath38 are markedly different in the three models . at energies where the energy losses due to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering on radiation fields are not important . 
 the three models generate the spectra noted below : @xmath39 the spectra for the secondary electrons are similar to those given in eq . [ eq : fn ] except that because of the dominance of the protons in the cosmic ray beam , the production rate of positions is higher , with = .this ratio @xmath40 is theoretically estimated from the characteristics of high energy interactions to be @xmath00.5 @xcite ; on the other hand , the direct observation of the @xmath41 ratio indicates a value of @xmath42 @xcite . in either case , 
 @xmath40 is essentially independent of energy beyond a few gev . 
 thus we see that , at high energies ( e@xmath4310 gev ) , in the leaky - box model b and in the nested leaky box model c , the secondary positron and electron spectra are power laws with indices @xmath44 equal to that of the spectrum of the nuclear component in cosmic rays . at very high energies , 
 the energy losses due to synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering will steepen these spectra to @xmath45 . 
 and @xmath38 from the total spectrum of the electronic component and have shown @xmath46 , the spectrum of electrons generated by the cosmic ray sources . the primary electron component @xmath46 is plotted for the hess , fermi , atic and other data using @xmath47 . the positron spectrum from the nested leaky box model c 
 is plotted as well ( solid line).,width=453 ]    ) , b , and c are compared with the observations . 
 all calculations are normalized at @xmath48 gev , width=453 ]    we find it useful to write the observed positron fraction @xmath49 in terms of the various components : r(e)=.here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the positron and electron spectra generated as secondaries of the nuclear component of cosmic rays , and @xmath52 is the spectrum of electrons resulting from direct acceleration in the sources . 
 note that there is no direct contribution to positrons from the source . 
 it is convenient sometimes to work with the inverse of @xmath49 given by p(e)=== 1++.this allows one to find the spectrum of electrons generated by the sources @xmath52 as g_e^-(e)=[p(e)-(1+)]f_n^+(e).this spectrum @xmath53 , generated in the galaxy exclusively by the cosmic ray sources , is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : primary ] . 
 alternatively , we may just assume the functional form for @xmath37 given by the various propagation models and calculate the positron fraction by dividing this by @xmath54 , the total spectrum of electrons measured by fermi , hess , and other experiments , r_m(e)=which is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : pammodels ] along with the data from pamela . 
 the normalization of the theoretical curves is such as to provide the best possible fit to the three models a , b , and c described earlier . 
 ( this normalization may indeed be explicitly calculated as it is proportional to @xmath19 , @xmath33 , and @xmath21 respectively for the three models and depends on the density of matter in the propagation region , the spectral flux of the nuclear component , the cross section for meson production , decay kinematics , etc . ) in depicting the three model curves , we have included the effect of the energy losses at high energies . 
 comparison of the theoretical expectations of the positron fraction with the pamela data indicates that model a provides a rather poor fit to the observation , as already noted by several authors @xcite . 
 a careful calculation of the positron fraction under the general assumptions of model a was carried out over a decade ago by moskalenko and strong @xcite . 
 our estimates here are essentially the same as that derived by them . 
 even though both model b and model c predict nearly identical injection spectra , the equilibrium spectra at low energies differ drastically with each other . in model b , 
 the injection spectrum has to be multiplied by @xmath33 to get the equilibrium spectrum . on the other hand , in the nested leaky box model 
 , we need to multiply only by @xmath21 @xcite@xcite . both these models predict identical equilibrium spectra at high energies , for @xmath55 gev . 
 the good fit to observed the positron fraction shows that the residence time of cosmic rays is essentially independent of energy for @xmath56 , a constancy that is expected to continue up to @xmath57 . 
 in choosing between model b and model c , the latter is preferred from considerations of the spectra of primary nuclei as well . 
 this is because for a simple power law input from the sources having a form @xmath58 , model b would be expected to yield a spectral form @xmath59 below @xmath48 gev and @xmath60 at higher energies . on the other hand , 
 the observed spectra of all the nucleonic components are simple power laws of slope @xmath61 with no changes of slope in the tens of gev region . 
 thus we conclude that the nested leaky box model provides good fit with the pamela data and is preferred also from consideration of other cosmic ray observations . 
 the main result that emerges from the present analysis is that the nested leaky box model provides a good fit to the positron fraction observed by pamela . 
 the model is also consistent with other observations of cosmic rays . until good measurements of 
 the positron fraction was available , there was no easy means of choosing amongst the various models . 
 the fact that the nuclear secondaries , such as li , be , and b , emerge from nuclear interactions with essentially the same energy per nucleon as their parents , c , n , and o , was the main cause for this uncertainty . 
 however , the fact that the positrons carry , on the average , a fraction of only about 0.05 of the energy of their nuclear primaries breaks this degeneracy , allowing a choice to be made . 
 improvements of the measurements of the spectra of both the secondary nuclei and of positrons will help in fixing , more firmly , the parameters of the nested leaky box model .    the recent measurements of the electronic component of cosmic rays by the pamela , hess , atic , and fermi groups have opened up many interesting new avenues to discuss cosmic ray propagation . some of these were discussed or hinted at in this paper .

61,"a long - standing problem in the study of elliptical galaxies is the far - ultraviolet ( uv ) excess in their spectra . 
 traditionally , elliptical galaxies were supposed to be passively evolving and not contain any young stars that radiate in the far - uv . 
 therefore , the discovery of an excess of radiation in the far - uv by the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _ mission 2 ( oao-2 ) @xcite came as a complete surprise . indeed , this was one of the first major discoveries in uv astronomy and became a basic property of elliptical galaxies . 
 this far - uv excess is often referred to as the `` uv - upturn '' , since the flux increases in the spectral energy distributions of elliptical galaxies as the wavelength decreases from 2000 to 1200 . 
 the uv - upturn is also known as uv rising - branch , uv rising flux , or simply uvx ( see the review by oconnell 1999 ) . 
 the uv - upturn phenomenon exists in virtually all elliptical galaxies and is the most variable photometric feature . 
 a famous correlation between uv - upturn magnitude and metallicity was found by burstein et  al .   from _ international ultraviolet explorer satellite _ 
 ( iue ) spectra of 24 quiescent early - type galaxies ( hereafter bbbfl relation ) . 
 the uv - upturn could be important in many respects : for the formation history and evolutionary properties of stars , the chemical enrichment of galaxies , galaxy dynamics , constraints to the stellar age and metallicity of galaxies and realistic `` k - corrections '' @xcite . 
 in particular , the uv - upturn has been proposed as a possible age indicator for giant elliptical galaxies @xcite . 
 the origin of the uv - upturn , however , has remained one of the great mysteries of extragalactic astrophysics for some 30 years @xcite , and numerous speculations have been put forward to explain it : non - thermal radiation from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , young massive stars , the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ) or post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars , horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and post - hb stars ( including post - early agb stars and agb - manqu stars ) and accreting white dwarfs @xcite . using observations made with the the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) and comparing them to synthetic spectra , ferguson et  al .   and subsequent studies by brown , ferguson & davidsen , brown et  al .  , and 
 dorman , oconnell & rood were able to show that the uv upturn is mainly caused by extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars . 
 brown et  al . 
 detected ehb stars for the first time in an elliptical galaxy ( the core of m  32 ) and therefore provided direct evidence for the ehb origin of the uv - upturn . 
 ehb stars , also known as subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars , are core - helium - burning stars with extremely thin hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath2 ) , and most of them are believed to have masses around @xmath3 @xcite , as has recently been confirmed asteroseismologically in the case of pg 0014 + 067 @xcite . 
 they have a typical luminosity of a few @xmath4 , a lifetime of @xmath5 , and a characteristic surface temperature of @xmath6 @xcite . 
 the origin of those hot , blue stars , as the major source of the far uv radiation , has remained an enigma in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) studies of elliptical galaxies . 
 two models , both involving single - star evolution , have previously been proposed to explain the uv - upturn : a metal - poor model @xcite and a metal - rich model @xcite . 
 the metal - poor model ascribes the uv - upturn to an old metal - poor population of hot subdwarfs , blue core - helium - burning stars , that originate from the low - metallicity tail of a stellar population with a wide metallicity distribution @xcite . 
 this model explains the bbbfl relation since elliptical galaxies with high average metallicity tend to be older and therefore have stronger uv - upturns . 
 the model tends to require a very large age of the population ( larger than the generally accepted age of the universe ) , and it is not clear whether the metal - poor population is sufficiently blue or not . 
 moreover , the required low - metallicity appears inconsistent with the large metallicity inferred for the majority of stars in elliptical galaxies @xcite .    in the metal - rich model 
 the uv - upturn is caused by metal - rich stars that lose their envelopes near the tip of the first - giant branch ( fgb ) . 
 this model @xcite assumes a relatively high metallicity  consistent with the metallicity of typical elliptical galaxies ( @xmath7 times the solar metallicity ) . in the model , 
 the mass - loss rate on the red - giant branch , usually scaled with the reimer s rate @xcite , is assumed to be enhanced , where the coefficient @xmath8 in the reimer s rate is taken to be @xmath9 times the canonical value . in order to reproduce the hb morphology of galactic globular clusters , either a broad distribution of @xmath8 is postulated @xcite , or , alternatively , a gaussian mass - loss distribution is applied that is designed to reproduce the distribution of horizontal - branch stars of a given age and metallicity @xcite . 
 this model also needs a population age that is generally larger than 10gyr . to explain the bbbfl uv - upturn  metallicity relation , the reimer s coefficient @xmath8 is assumed to increase with metallicity , and the enrichment parameter for the helium abundance associated with the increase in metallicity , @xmath10 , needs to be @xmath11 . 
 both of these models are quite _ ad hoc _ : there is neither observational evidence for a very old , low - metallicity sub - population in elliptical galaxies , nor is there a physical explanation for the very high mass loss required for just a small subset of stars . 
 furthermore , the onset of the formation of the hot subdwarfs is very sudden as the stellar population evolves , and both models require a large age for the production of the hot stars . as a consequence , 
 the models predict that the uv upturn of elliptical galaxies declines rapidly with redshift . 
 however , this does not appear to be consistent with recent observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ 
 ( hst ) @xcite . 
 the recent survey with the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) satellite @xcite showed that the intrinsic uv - upturn seems not to decrease in strength with redshift . 
 the bbbfl relation shows that the @xmath0 colour becomes bluer with metallicity ( or lick spectral index mg@xmath12 ) , where @xmath0 is the far - uv magnitude relative to the @xmath13 magnitude . 
 the relation could support the metal - rich model . 
 however , the correlation is far from being conclusively established . 
 ohl et  al . 
 studied the far - uv colour gradients in 8 early - type galaxies and found no correlation between the fuv-_b _ colour gradients and the internal metallicity gradients based on the mg@xmath12 spectral line index , a result not expected from the bbbfl relation . 
 deharveng , boselli & donas studied the far - uv radiation of 82 early - type galaxies , a uv - flux selected sample , and compared them to the bbbfl sample , investigating individual objects with a substantial record in the refereed literature spectroscopically . 
 they found no correlation between the @xmath1 colour and the mg@xmath12 spectral index . 
 rich et  al .   also found no correlation in a sample of 172 red quiescent early - type galaxies observed by galex and the _ sloan digital sky survey _ 
 ( sdss ) . indeed , 
 if there is a weak correlation in the data , the correlation is in the opposite sense to that of bbbfl : metal - rich galaxies have redder @xmath14 ( far - uv magnitude minus red magnitude ) . on the other hand , boselli et  al . 
 , using new galex data , reported a mild positive correlation between @xmath15 , which is the far - uv magnitude relative to the near - uv , and metallicity in a sample of early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster . 
 donas et  al . 
 use galex photometry to construct colour - colour relationships for nearby early - type galaxies sorted by morphological type . 
 they also found a marginal positive correlation between @xmath15 and metallicity . 
 these correlations , however , do not necessarily support the bbbfl relation , as neither boselli et  al .   nor donas et  al . 
 show that @xmath14 correlates significantly with metallicity . 
 therefore , this apparent lack of an observed correlation between the strength of the uv - upturn and metallicity casts some doubt on the metal - rich scenario . 
 both models ignore the effects of binary evolution . on the other hand , hot subdwarfs 
 have long been studied in our own galaxy @xcite , and it is now well established that the vast majority of ( and quite possibly all ) galactic hot subdwarfs are the results of binary interactions . 
 observationally , more than half of galactic hot subdwarfs are found in binaries @xcite , and orbital parameters have been determined for a significant sample @xcite . 
 there has also been substantial theoretical progress @xcite . 
 recently , han et  al . 
 proposed a binary model ( hereafter hpmm model ) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in binaries and single hot subdwarfs . in the model , there are three formation channels for hot subdwarfs , involving common - envelope @xcite ejection for hot subdwarf binaries with short orbital periods , stable roche lobe overflow for hot subdwarfs with long orbital periods , and the merger of helium white dwarfs to form single hot subdwarfs . 
 the model can explain the main observational characteristics of hot subdwarfs , in particular , their distributions in the orbital period 
 minimum companion mass diagram and in the effective temperature  surface gravity diagram , their distributions of orbital period and mass function , their binary fraction and the fraction of hot subdwarf binaries with white dwarf ( wd ) companions , their birth rates and their space density . 
 more recent observations ( e.g.  lisker et  al .  2004 , 2005 ) support the hpmm model , and the model is now widely used in the study of hot subdwarfs ( e.g.  heber et  al . 
 2004 , morales - rueda , maxted & marsh 2004 , charpinet et  al . 
 2005 , morales - rueda et  al . 
 2006 ) . 
 hot subdwarfs radiate in uv , and we can apply the hpmm scenario without any further assumptions to the uv - upturn problem of elliptical galaxies . 
 the only assumption we have to make is that the stellar population in elliptical galaxies , specifically their binary properties , are similar to those in our own galaxy . indeed , as we will show in this paper , the uv flux from hot subdwarfs produced in binaries is important . 
 this implies that any model for elliptical galaxies that does not include these binary channels is _ necessarily _ incomplete or has to rely on the _ apriori _ implausible assumption that the binary population in elliptical galaxies is intrinsically different . 
 the main purpose of this paper is to develop an _ apriori _ eps model for the uv - upturn of elliptical galaxies , by employing the hpmm scenario for the formation of hot subdwarfs , and to compare the model results with observations . 
 the outline of the paper is as follows . 
 we describe the eps model in section 2 and the simulations in section 3 . in section 4 
 we present the results and discuss them , and end the paper with a summary and conclusions in section 5 . 
 eps is a technique for modelling the spectrophotometric properties of a stellar population using our knowledge of stellar evolution . 
 the technique was first devised by tinsley @xcite and has experienced rapid development ever since @xcite . 
 recently , binary interactions have also been incorporated into eps studies @xcite with the rapid binary - evolution code developed by hurley , tout & pols . in the present paper 
 we incorporate the hpmm model into eps by adopting the binary population synthesis ( bps ) code of han et  al .  , which was designed to investigate the formation of many interesting binary - related objects , including hot subdwarfs . 
 the bps code of han et  al .  was originally developed in 1994 and has been updated regularly ever since @xcite . with the code , 
 millions of stars ( including binaries ) can be evolved simultaneously from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the white - dwarf ( wd ) stage or a supernova explosion . 
 the code can simulate in a monte - carlo way the formation of many types of stellar objects , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , double degenerates ( dds ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , barium stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) and hot subdwarfs . note that `` hot subdwarfs '' in this paper 
 is used as a collective term for subdwarf b stars , subdwarf o stars , and subdwarf ob stars . 
 they are core - helium - burning stars with thin hydrogen envelopes and radiate mainly in the uv ( see figure  [ chart ] for the formation channels of hot subdwarfs ) . 
 the main input into the bps code is a grid of stellar models . for the purpose of this paper , 
 we use a population i ( pop i ) grid with a typical metallicity @xmath16 . 
 the grid , calculated with eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite , covers the evolution of normal stars in the range of @xmath17 with hydrogen abundance @xmath18 and helium abundance @xmath19 , helium stars in the range of @xmath20 and hot subdwarfs in the range of @xmath21 ( see han et  al . 
 2002 , 2003 for details ) . 
 single stars are evolved via interpolations in the model grid . in this paper 
 , we use @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 as the interpolation variable between stellar evolution tracks , where @xmath22 is the time from the zams to the tip of the fgb for a given stellar mass @xmath24 and is calculated from fitting formulae . 
 this is to avoid artefacts in following the time evolution of hot subdwarfs produced from a stellar population . 
 the code needs to model the evolution of binary stars as well as of single stars . 
 the evolution of binaries is more complicated due to the occurrence of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) . 
 the binaries of main interest here usually experience two phases of rlof : the first when the primary fills its roche lobe which may produce a wd binary , and the second when the secondary fills its roche lobe . 
 the mass gainer in the first rlof phase is most likely a main - sequence ( ms ) star . 
 if the mass ratio @xmath25 at the onset of rlof is lower than a critical value , @xmath26 , rlof is stable @xcite . for systems experiencing their first phase of rlof in the hertzsprung gap , we use @xmath27 as is supported by detailed binary - evolution calculations of han et  al .  . 
 for the first rlof phase on the fgb or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , we mainly use @xmath28 . 
 full binary calculations @xcite demonstrate that @xmath29 is typical for rlof in fgb stars . 
 we do not explicitly include tidally enhanced stellar winds @xcite in our calculation . 
 using a larger value for @xmath26 is equivalent to including a tidally enhanced stellar wind to some degree while keeping the simulation simple ( see hpmm for details ) . 
 alternatively , we also adopt @xmath30 in order to examine the consequences of varying this important criterion .    for stable rlof 
 , we assume that a fraction @xmath31 of the mass lost from the primary is transferred onto the gainer , while the rest is lost from the system ( @xmath32 means that rlof is conservative ) . 
 note , however , that we assume that mass transfer is always conservative when the donor is a ms star . 
 the mass lost from the system also takes away a specific angular momentum @xmath33 in units of the specific angular momentum of the system . 
 the unit is expressed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the separation and @xmath36 is the orbital period of the binary ( see podsiadlowski , joss & hsu 1992 for details ) . 
 stable rlof usually results in a wide wd binary . 
 some of the wide wd binaries may contain hot subdwarf stars and ms companions if rlof occurs near the tip of the fgb ( _ 1st stable rlof channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . in order to reproduce galactic hot subdwarfs , we use @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the first stable rlof in all systems except for those on the ms ( see hpmm for details ) . 
 if rlof is dynamically unstable , a common envelope ( ce ) may be formed @xcite , and if the orbital energy deposited in the envelope can overcome its binding energy , the ce may be ejected . for the ce ejection criterion , we introduced two model parameters , @xmath39 for the common envelope ejection efficiency and @xmath40 for the thermal contribution to the binding energy of the envelope , which we write as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the orbital energy that is released , @xmath43 is the gravitational binding energy and 
 @xmath44 is the thermal energy of the envelope . 
 both @xmath43 and @xmath45 are obtained from full stellar structure calculations ( see han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 for details ; also see dewi & tauris 2000 ) instead of analytical approximations . ce ejection leads to the formation of a close wd binary . 
 some of the close wd binaries may contain hot subdwarf stars and ms companions if the ce occurs near the tip of the fgb ( _ 1st ce channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . 
 we adopt @xmath46 in our standard model , and @xmath47 to investigate the effect of varying the ce ejection parameters . 
 the wd binary formed from the first rlof phase continues to evolve , and the secondary may fill its roche lobe as a red giant . 
 the system then experiences a second rlof phase . 
 if the mass ratio at the onset of rlof is greater than @xmath26 given in table  3 of han et  al . 
 , rlof is dynamically unstable , leading again to a ce phase . 
 if the ce is ejected , a hot subdwarf star may be formed . 
 the hot subdwarf binary has a short orbital period and a wd companion ( _ 2nd ce channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . 
 however , rlof may be stable if the mass ratio is sufficiently small . in this case 
 , we assume that the mass lost from the mass donor is all lost from the system , carrying away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the wd companion . 
 stable rlof may then result in the formation of a hot subdwarf binary with a wd companion and a long orbital period ( typically @xmath48 , _ 
 2nd stable rlof channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . 
 if the second rlof phase results in a ce phase and the ce is ejected , a double white dwarf system is formed @xcite . 
 some of the double wd systems contain two helium wds . 
 angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave radiation may then cause the shrinking of the orbital separation until the less massive white dwarf starts to fill its roche lobe . 
 this will lead to its dynamical disruption if @xmath49 or @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mass of the donor ( i.e. the less massive wd ) and @xmath52 is the mass of the gainer @xcite . 
 this is expected to always lead to a complete merger of the two white dwarfs . 
 the merger can also produce a hot subdwarf star , but in this case the hot subdwarf star is a single object ( _ he wd merger channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . 
 if the lighter wd is not disrupted , rlof is stable and an am cvn system is formed .    in this paper 
 , we do not include a tidally enhanced stellar wind explicitly as was done in han et  al . 
 ( 1995 ) and han ( 1998 ) . 
 instead we use a standard reimers wind formula ( reimers 1975 ) with @xmath53 @xcite which is included in our stellar models . 
 this is to keep the simulations as simple as possible , although the effects of a tidally enhanced wind can to some degree be implicitly included by using a larger value of @xmath26 . 
 we also employ a standard magnetic braking law @xcite where appropriate ( see podsiadlowski , han & rappaport 2002 for details and further discussion ) .      in order to investigate the uv - upturn phenomenon due to hot subdwarfs 
 , we have performed a series of monte - carlo simulations where we follow the evolution of a sample of a million binaries ( single stars are in effect treated as very wide binaries that do not interact with each other ) , including the hot subdwarfs produced in the simulations , according to our grids of stellar models . 
 the simulations require as input the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primary , the initial mass - ratio distribution and the distribution of initial orbital separations . 
 \(1 ) the sfr is taken to be a single starburst in most of our simulations ; all the stars have the same age ( @xmath54 ) and the same metallicity ( @xmath16 ) , and constitute a simple stellar population ( ssp ) . in some simulations a composite stellar population ( csp ) is also used ( section  3.3 ) . 
 \(2 ) a simple approximation to the imf of miller & scalo is used ; the primary mass is generated with the formula of eggleton , fitchett & tout , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 . the adopted range of primary masses is 0.8 to @xmath57 . 
 the studies by kroupa , tout & gilmore and zoccali et  al . 
 support this imf . 
 \(3 ) the mass - ratio distribution is quite uncertain . 
 we mainly take a constant mass - ratio distribution @xcite , @xmath58 where @xmath59 . as alternatives 
 we also consider a rising mass ratio distribution @xmath60 and the case where both binary components are chosen randomly and independently from the same imf . 
 \(4 ) we assume that all stars are members of binary systems and that the distribution of separations is constant in @xmath61 ( where @xmath35 is the orbital separation ) for wide binaries and falls off smoothly at close separations : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . 
 this distribution implies that there is an equal number of wide binary systems per logarithmic interval and that approximately 50 per cent of stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100yr .      in order to obtain the colours and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the populations produced by our simulations , we have calculated spectra for hot subdwarfs using plane - parallel static model stellar atmospheres computed with the atlas9 stellar atmosphere code @xcite with the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . 
 solar metal abundances were adopted @xcite and line blanketing is approximated by appropriate opacity distribution functions interpolated for the chosen helium abundance . 
 the resulting model atmosphere grid covers a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath67 with a spacing of @xmath68 ) , gravities ( @xmath69 with @xmath70 ) , and helium abundances ( @xmath71 \le 0 $ ] ) , as appropriate for the hot subdwarfs produced in the bps code . for the spectrum and colours of other single stars 
 , we use the latest version of the comprehensive basel library of theoretical stellar spectra ( see lejeune et  al .  1997 , 1998 for a description ) , which gives the colours and seds of stars with a wide range of @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . 
 our model follows the evolution of the integrated spectra of stellar populations . in order to compare the results with observations , 
 we calculate the following observables as well as @xmath75 colours in the johnson system @xcite .    1 . 
 @xmath0 is a colour defined by bbbfl . 
 it is a combination of the short - wavelength iue flux and the @xmath13 magnitude and is used to express the magnitude of the uv - upturn : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy flux per unit wavelength averaged between 1250 and 1850   and @xmath78 the flux averaged between 5055 and 5945  ( for the @xmath13 band ) : 2 . 
 @xmath79 is a colour defined for the iue flux by dorman , oconnell & rood . 
 @xmath80 3 . 
 @xmath1 is a colour used by deharveng , boselli & donas in their study of uv properties of the early - type galaxies observed with the balloon - borne foca experiment @xcite : @xmath81 4 . 
 @xmath15 , @xmath14 , @xmath82 are colours from galex and sdss . 
 galex , a nasa small explorer mission , has two bands in its ultraviolet ( uv ) survey : a far - uv band centered on 1530   and a near - uv band centered on 2310   @xcite , while sdss has five passbands , u at 3551 , g at 4686 , r at 6165 , i at 7481 , and z at 8931   @xcite . 
 the magnitudes are in the ab system of oke & gunn : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the energy fluxes per unit frequency averaged in the frequency bands corresponding to 1350 and 1750 , 1750 and 2750 , 5500 and 7000 , respectively . 5 .   @xmath89 is a far - uv spectral index we defined to measure the sed slope between 1075 and 1750 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the energy flux per unit wavelength . in this paper 
 , we fit far - uv seds with equation ( [ slope ] ) to obtain @xmath89 . in the fitting we ignored the part between 1175 and 1250   for the theoretical seds from our model , as this part corresponds to the l@xmath92 line . 
 we also obtained @xmath89 via a similar fitting for early - type galaxies observed with the hut @xcite and the iue @xcite . 
 we again ignored the part between 1175 and 1250   for the hut seds , while the iue seds do not have any data points below 1250 .

 [ models ]    in order to investigate the uv - upturn systematically , we performed six sets of simulations for a population i composition ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath16 ) . 
 the first set is a standard set with the best - choice model parameters from hpmm . in sets 2 to 5 we systematically vary the model parameters , and set 6 models a composite stellar population ( table  [ models ] ) .      in the hpmm model , hot subdwarfs are produced through binary interactions by stable rlof , ce ejection or he wd mergers . 
 the main parameters in the hpmm model are : @xmath93 , the initial mass ratio distribution , @xmath94 , the critical mass ratio above which the 1st rlof on the fgb or agb is unstable , @xmath39 , the ce ejection efficiency parameter , and @xmath40 , the contribution of thermal energy to the binding energy of the ce ( see sections  2.1 and 2.2 for details ) . 
 the model that best reproduces the observed properties of hot subdwarfs in our galaxy has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , ( see section 7.4 of han et  al . 
 these are the parameters adopted in our standard simulation .    in our standard set , 
 we first construct a ssp containing a million binaries ( section  2.2 ) . 
 the binaries are formed simultaneously ( i.e. in a single starburst ) and with the same metallicity ( @xmath16 ) . 
 the ssp is evolved with the bps code ( section  2.1 ) , and the results are convolved with our spectral libraries ( section  2.3 ) to produce integrated seds and other observables . 
 the seds are normalised to a stellar population of mass @xmath102 at a distance of 10mpc .      in order to investigate the importance of the model parameters 
 , we also carried out simulation sets in which we systematically varied the main parameters . 
 specifically , we adopted three initial mass - ratio distributions : a constant mass - ratio distribution , a rising mass - ratio distribution , and one where the component masses are uncorrelated and drawn independently from a miller - scalo imf ( section  2.2 ) . 
 we also varied the value of @xmath94 in the instability criterion for the first rlof phase on the fgb or agb from 1.5 to 1.2 , the parameter @xmath39 for ce ejection efficiency and the parameter @xmath40 for the thermal contribution to ce ejection from 0.75 to 1.0 . 
 many early - type galaxies show evidence for some moderate amount of recent star formation @xcite . 
 therefore , we also perform simulations in which we evolve composite stellar populations . here , a composite stellar population ( csp ) consists of two populations , a major old one and a minor younger one . 
 the major population has solar metallicity and an age of @xmath95 , where all stars formed in a single burst @xmath95 ago , while the minor one has solar metallicity and an age @xmath96 , where all stars formed in a starburst starting @xmath96 ago and lasting 0.1gyr . 
 the minor population fraction @xmath97 is the ratio of the mass of the minor population to the total mass of the csp ( for @xmath103 the csp is actually a ssp with an age @xmath96 ) . 
 in our standard simulation set , we follow the evolution of the integrated sed of a ssp ( including binaries ) of @xmath102 up to @xmath104 . 
 the ssp is assumed to be at a distance of 10mpc and the evolution is shown in figure  [ sed ] . 
 note that hot subdwarfs originating from binary interactions start to dominate the far - uv after @xmath105gyr . 
 we have compiled a file containing the spectra of the ssp with ages from 0.1gyr to 15gyr and devised a small fortran code to read the file ( and to plot the seds with pgplot ) . 
 the file and the code are available online . in order to be able to apply the model directly , 
 we have also provided in the file the spectra of the ssp without any binary interactions considered . 
 this provides an easy way to examine the differences in the spectra for simulations with and without binary interactions .

in gyr ; @xmath107 = absolute visual magnitude ;

 the colours of the ssp evolve in time , and table  [ colours ] lists the colours of a ssp ( including binaries ) of @xmath102 at various ages for the standard simulation set . in order to see how the colours evolve with redshift 
 , we adopted a @xmath118cdm cosmology @xcite with cosmological parameters of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and assumed a star - formation redshift of @xmath122 to obtain figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] . 
 the figures show the evolution of the restframe intrinsic colours and the evolution of the far - uv spectral index with redshift ( lookback time ) . 
 as these figures show , the uv - upturn does not evolve much with redshift ; for an old stellar population ( i.e. with a redshift @xmath123 or an age of @xmath124gyr ) , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 . 
 colour - colour diagrams are widely used as a diagnostic tool in the study of stellar populations of early - type galaxies . 
 we present a few such diagrams in figures  [ cc01 ] and  [ cc02 ] for the standard simulation set . in these figures , 
 most curves have a turning - point at @xmath131 , at which hot subdwarfs resulting from binary interactions start to dominate the far - uv .      in our model , there are three channels for the formation of hot subdwarfs . in the stable rlof channel , 
 the hydrogen - rich envelope of a star with a helium core is removed by stable mass transfer , and helium is ignited in the core . the hot subdwarfs from this channel are in binaries with long orbital periods ( typically @xmath132 ) . in the ce ejection channel , 
 the envelope is ejected as a consequence of the spiral - in in a ce phase . 
 the resulting hot subdwarf binaries have very short orbital periods ( typically @xmath133 ) . in the merger channel , a helium wd pair coalesces to produce a single object . 
 hot subdwarfs from the merger channel are generally more massive than those from stable rlof channel or the ce channel and have much thinner ( or no ) hydrogen envelope . 
 they are therefore expected to be hotter . 
 see han et  al .   for further details . 
 figure  [ channel ] shows the seds of the hot subdwarfs produced from the different formation channels at various ages . 
 it shows that hot subdwarfs from the rlof channel are always important , while the ce channel becomes important at an age of @xmath131 . 
 the merger channel , however , catches up with the ce channel at @xmath134 and the stable rlof channel at @xmath135 , and dominates the far - uv flux afterwards .      in order to systematically investigate the dependence of the uv - upturn on the parameters of our model 
 , we now vary the major model parameters : @xmath93 for the initial mass - ratio distribution , @xmath136 for the critical mass ratio for stable rlof on the fgb or agb , @xmath39 for the ce ejection efficiency and @xmath40 for the thermal contribution to the ce ejection . 
 we carried out four more simulation sets ( table  [ models ] ) . 
 figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] show the uv - upturn evolution of the various simulation sets . 
 these figures show that the initial mass - ratio distribution is very important . as an extreme case 
 , the mass - ratio distribution for uncorrelated component masses ( set 2 ) makes the uv - upturn much weaker , by @xmath137 in @xmath0 or @xmath14 , as compared to the standard simulation set . on the other hand 
 , a rising distribution ( set 3 ) makes the uv - upturn stronger . 
 binaries with a mass - ratio distribution of uncorrelated component masses tend to have bigger values of @xmath138 ( the ratio of the mass of the primary to the mass of the secondary ) , and mass transfer is more likely to be unstable . as a result , the numbers of hot subdwarfs from the stable rlof channel and the merger channel are greatly reduced , and the uv - upturn is smaller in strength . 
 binaries with a rising mass - ratio distribution tend to have smaller values of @xmath138 and therefore produce a larger uv - upturn 
 . a lower @xmath94 ( set 4 ) leads to a weaker uv - upturn , as the numbers of hot subdwarfs from the stable rlof channel and the merger channel are reduced . 
 a higher ce ejection efficiency @xmath39 and a higher thermal contribution factor @xmath40 ( set 5 ) result in an increase in the number of hot subdwarfs from the ce channel , but a decrease in the number from the merger channel , and the uv - upturn is not affected much as a consequence . 
 binaries evolve differently from single stars due to the occurrence of mass transfer . 
 mass transfer may prevent mass donors from evolving to higher luminosity and can produce hotter objects than expected in a single - star population of a certain age ( mainly hot subdwarfs and blue stragglers ) . to demonstrate the importance of binary interactions for the uv - upturn explicitly , we plotted seds of a population for two cases in figure  [ binary ] . 
 case 1 ( solid curves ) is for our standard simulation set , which includes various binary interactions , while case 2 ( light grey curves ) is for a population of the same mass without any binary interactions . 
 the figure shows that the hot subdwarfs produced by binary interactions are the dominant contributors to the far - uv for a population older than @xmath131 . 
 note , however , that blue stragglers resulting from binary interactions are important contributors to the far - uv between 0.5 gyr and 1.5 gyr .    in order to assess the importance of binary interactions for the uv upturn , we define factors that give the fraction of the flux in a particular waveband that originates from hot subdwarfs produced in binaries : @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the integrated flux between 900   and 1800   radiated by hot subdwarfs ( and their descendants ) produced by binary interactions , and @xmath141 is the total integrated flux between 900   and 1800  . 
 we also defined other similar factors , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , for passbands of 1250   to 1850  , 1921   to 2109 , and 2200   to 2800 , respectively . 
 figure  [ bt ] shows the time evolution of those factors . 
 as the figure shows , the hot - subdwarf contribution becomes increasingly important in the far- and near - uv as the population ages . 
 early - type galaxies with a recent minor starburst can be modelled as a composite stellar population ( csp ) . 
 a csp contains a major population with an age of @xmath95 and a minor population of age @xmath145 and mass fraction @xmath97 ( section  3.3 ) . 
 figure  [ frfn ] shows the colour  colour diagram for csps with @xmath146 with varying @xmath96 and @xmath97 . 
 note that the curves of different @xmath97 start to converge to the ssp curve , the curve of @xmath103 , for @xmath147 . 
 this implies that there exists a strong degeneracy between the age of the minor population and the mass fraction . 
 in our binary population synthesis model , we adopted solar metallicity . to test the model , we chose ngc 3379 , a typical elliptical galaxy with a metallicity close to solar @xcite to fit the far - uv sed . 
 figure  [ fitting ] presents various fits that illustrate the effects of different sub - populations with different ages and different amounts of assumed extinction . 
 as the figure shows , acceptable fits can be obtained for the various cases . 
 our best fits require the presence of a sub - population of relatively young stars with an age @xmath148gyr , making up @xmath149% of the total population mass . 
 the existence of a relatively young population could imply the existence of some core - collapse supernovae in these galaxies . 
 if we assume that an elliptical galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath150 and @xmath151 of the mass was formed _ during _ the last 0.4gyr , then a mean star formation rate would be @xmath152 , about one tenth that of the galaxy . 
 core - collapse supernovae would be possible . 
 indeed , a type ib supernova , sn 2000ds , was discovered in ngc 2768 , an elliptical galaxy of type e6 @xcite 
 .      there is increasing evidence that many elliptical galaxies had some recent minor star - formation events @xcite , which also contribute to the far - uv excess . 
 to model such secondary minor starbursts , we have constructed csp galaxy models , consisting of one old , dominant population with an assumed age @xmath153 and a younger population of variable age , making up a fraction @xmath97 of the stellar mass of the system . 
 our spectral modelling shows that a recent minor starburst mostly affects the slope in the far - uv sed , and we therefore defined a far - uv slope index @xmath89 ( section  2.4 ) . in order to assess the importance of binary interactions 
 , we also defined a binary contribution factor @xmath154 ( section  4.1.6 ) , which is the fraction of far - uv flux radiated by hot subdwarfs produced by binary interactions . 
 figure  [ beta ] shows the far - uv slope as a function of uv excess , a potentially powerful diagnostic diagram which illustrates how the uv properties of elliptical galaxies evolve with time in a dominant old population with a young minor sub - population . for comparison 
 , we also plot observed elliptical galaxies . 
 some of the observed galaxies are from astro-2 observations with an aperture of @xmath155 @xcite , some are from iue observations with an aperture of @xmath156 @xcite . the value of @xmath89 for ngc 1399 , however , is derived from astro-1 hut observation with an aperture of @xmath157 @xcite , and its @xmath0 comes from the iue observations . as the far - uv light is more concentrated toward the centre of the galaxy than the optical light @xcite , the value of @xmath0 for ngc 1399 should be considered an upper limit for the galaxy area covered by the observation . 
 the galaxies plotted are all elliptical galaxies except for ngc 5102 , which is a s0 galaxy , and the nucleus of m  31 , which is a sb galaxy . 
 active galaxies or galaxies with large errors in @xmath89 from bbbfl have not been plotted . 
 overall , the model covers the observed range of properties reasonably well . 
 note in particular that the majority of galaxies lie in the part of the diagram where the uv contribution from binaries is expected to dominate ( i.e. where @xmath158 ) . 
 the location of m  60 and m  89 in this figure implies @xmath159 and @xmath160 with @xmath161 . 
 interestingly , inspection of the hut spectrum of m  60 ( see the mid - left panel of figure  3 in brown et  al .  ) shows the presence of a marginal c  iv absorption line near 1550 . 
 chandra observations show that m  89 has a low luminosity agn @xcite . 
 this would make @xmath0 bluer and may also provide indirect evidence for low levels of star formation . 
 the galaxy ngc 1399 requires special mention , as it is uv - bright and the young star - hypothesis was believed to have been ruled out due to the lack of strong c  iv absorption lines in its hut spectrum @xcite . 
 however , any young star signature , if it exists , would have been diluted greatly in the hut spectrum , as the aperture of the hut observation is much larger than that of the iue observation covering mainly the galaxy nucleus . 
 our model is sensitive to both low levels and high levels of star formation . 
 it suggests that elliptical galaxies had some star formation activity in the relatively recent past ( @xmath162gyr ago ) . 
 agn and supernova activity may provide qualitative supporting evidence for this picture , since the former often appears to be accompanied by active star formation , while supernovae , both core collapse and thermonuclear , tend to occur mainly within 12gyr after a starburst in the most favoured supernova models . in figure  [ beta ] , we have plotted 13 early - type galaxies altogether . using the padova - asiago supernova online catalogue , which lists supernovae recorded ever since 1885 , we found 8 supernovae in six of the galaxies : sn 1885a ( type i ) in m  31 , sn 1969q ( type unavailable ) in m  49 , sn 2004w ( type ia ) in m  60 , sn 1939b ( type i ) in m  59 , sn 1957b ( type ia ) , sn 1980i ( type ia ) , sn 1991bg ( type ia ) in m  84 and sn 1935b ( type unavailable ) in ngc 3115 . 
 the majority of supernovae in these galaxies appear to be of type ia . 
 similar to the above subsection , we have constructed composite stellar population models for elliptical galaxies consisting of a major old population ( @xmath153 ) and a minor younger population , but for colour - colour diagrams . 
 figure  [ 15v ] shows the appearance of a galaxy in the colour - colour diagrams of @xmath0 versus @xmath79 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath1 versus @xmath79 ( panel ( b ) ) in the csp model for different fractions @xmath97 and different ages of the minor population . 
 solid squares in panel ( a ) of the figure are for quiescent early - type galaxies observed with iue by bbbfl and the data points are taken from table  2 of dorman , oconnell & wood . 
 the observed data points are located in a region without recent star formation or with a very low level of recent star formation ( @xmath163 ) . therefore , the observations are naturally explained with our model . 
 panel ( a ) shows the epoch when the effects of the starburst fade away , leading to a fast evolution of the galaxy colours , and the diagram therefore provides a potentially powerful diagnostic to identify a minor starburst in an otherwise old elliptical galaxy that occurred up to @xmath164gyr ago . for larger ages , 
 the curves tend to converge in the @xmath79 versus @xmath0 diagram . 
 note that this is not so much the case in the @xmath79 versus @xmath1 diagram , which therefore could provide better diagnostics . 
 figure  [ 20v ] is a diagram of @xmath116 versus @xmath1 for a csp with a major population age @xmath165 and variable minor population age @xmath96 and various minor population mass fractions @xmath97 . 
 overlayed on this diagram is figure  2 of deharveng , boselli & donas for observational data points of early - type galaxies . 
 ngc 205 and ngc 5102 ( the circles with crosses above the line @xmath166 ) are known to have direct evidence of massive star formation @xcite ; therefore deharveng , boselli & donas individually examined the seven galaxies with @xmath167 in their sample for suspected star formation . 
 cgcg 119053 , cgcg 97125 , vcc 1499 ( the three solid squares with big stars ) showed hints of star formation , ngc 4168 ( the solid square with a big triangle ) has a low - luminosity seyfert nucleus and cgcg 119030 ( the solid square with a big diamond ) could be a spiral galaxy instead of an elliptical galaxy . 
 however , no hint of star formation has been found for vcc 616 ( the solid square on the far - left above the line @xmath166 ) and cgcg 119086 ( the solid square on the far - right above the line @xmath166 ) . 
 our model can explain the observations satisfactorily except for cgcg 119086 , which needs further study . 
 figure  [ fr ] shows the diagrams of @xmath14 versus @xmath15 for a csp galaxy model with a major population age @xmath165 and variable minor population age @xmath96 and various minor population mass fractions @xmath97 . in these diagrams , 
 the colours are not shown in the restframe , but have been redshifted ( i.e. the wavelength is @xmath168 times the restframe wavelength , where @xmath169 is the redshift ) ; panel ( a ) is for a redshift of @xmath170 and panel ( b ) for @xmath171 . 
 overlayed on the two panels are quiescent early - type galaxies observed with galex by rich et  al .  . 
 the observed galaxies are for a redshift range @xmath172 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath173 ( panel ( b ) ) . 
 we note that most of the quiescent galaxies are located in the region with @xmath174 .    in figures 
 [ 15v ] to  [ fr ] , we adopted a major population age of @xmath175 , and the colours are intrinsic . 
 however , adopting a different age for the major population can change the diagrams ; for example , a larger age leads to bluer @xmath79 or @xmath176 colours . 
 in contrast , internal dust extinction shifts the curves towards redder colours @xcite . considering the uncertainties in the modelling , we take our model to be in reasonable agreement with the observations . 
 there is an observed spread in the @xmath0 , @xmath79 and @xmath1 colours of early - type galaxies . as can be seen from figures  [ beta ] ,  [ 15v ] , and  [ 20v ] , this spread 
 is satisfactorily explained by our model . 
 brown et  al 
 .   showed with hst observations that the uv - upturn does not evolve much with redshift , a result apparently confirmed by rich et  al .   with galex observation of a large sample . 
 this is contrary to the prediction of both the metal - poor and the metal - rich model , as both models require a large age for the hot subdwarfs and therefore predict that the uv - upturn should decline rapidly with redshift . 
 our binary model , however , predicts that that uv - upturn does not evolve much with redshift ( see figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] ) , consistent with the recent observations . 
 lee et  al .   and ree et  al 
 .   studied the look - back time evolution of the uv - upturn from the brightest elliptical galaxies in 12 clusters at redshift @xmath177 with galex . 
 compared to local giant elliptical galaxies , they found that the uv - upturn of the 12 galaxies is redder . 
 however , the local giant elliptical galaxies are quite special . 
 ngc 1399 and m  87 , with the strongest uv - upturn , have the largest known specific frequencies of globular clusters @xcite , and m  87 hosts an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with the best - known jet @xcite . 
 given a larger sample of elliptical galaxies , no matter how luminous they are , and a bigger redshift range , the uv - upturn is not found to decline with redshift . 
 boselli et  al . 
 studied the uv properties of 264 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with galex . 
 they showed that @xmath15 ranges from 3 to 0 , consistent with the theoretical range shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ uvz2 ] . 
 the colour index @xmath15 of those galaxies becomes bluer with luminosity from dwarfs ( @xmath178 ) to giants ( @xmath179 ) , i.e. a luminous galaxy tends to have a bluer @xmath15 . 
 panel ( b ) of figure  [ uvz2 ] shows that @xmath15 becomes bluer with population age for @xmath180 . 
 taking the stellar populations as an `` averaged '' ssp , we may conclude that a luminous early - type galaxy is older , or in other words , the less luminous an early - type galaxy is , the younger the stellar population is or the later the population formed .      as far as we know 
 , metallicity does not play a significant role in the mass - transfer process or the envelope ejection process for the formation of hot subdwarfs , although it may affect the properties of the binary population in more subtle ways . 
 we therefore expect that @xmath14 or @xmath0 from our model is not very sensitive to the metallicity of the population , this is in agreement with the recent large sample of galex observations by rich et  al .  . 
 boselli et  al .   and donas et  al . 
 studied nearby early - type galaxies with galex . 
 neither of them show that @xmath14 correlates significantly with metallicity , however , both of them found a positive correlation between @xmath15 and metallicity . 
 this can possibly be explained with our model . 
 the uv - upturn magnitudes @xmath14 or @xmath0 does not evolve much with age for @xmath181 while @xmath15 decreases significantly with age ( see figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] ) . 
 a galaxy of high metallicity may have a larger age and therefore a stronger @xmath15 . 
 both metal - poor and metal - rich models are quite _ ad hoc _ and require a large age for the hot subdwarf population ( section  1 ) , which implies that the uv - upturn declines rapidly with look - back time or redshift . in our model , 
 hot subdwarfs are produced naturally by envelope loss through binary interactions , which do not depend much on the age of the population older than @xmath131 , and therefore our model predicts little if any evolution of the uv - upturn with redshift . 
 note , however , that @xmath15 declines significantly more with redshift than @xmath14 , as the contribution to the near - uv from blue stragglers resulting from binary interactions becomes less important for an older population . 
 the metal - rich model predicts a positive correlation between the magnitude of the uv - upturn and metallicity ; for example , @xmath0 correlates with metallicity . 
 however , such a correlation is not expected from our binary model as metallicity does not play an essential role in the binary interactions . 
 furthermore , even though the metal - rich model could in principle account for the uv - upturn in old , metal - rich giant ellipticals , it can not produce a uv - upturn in lower - metallicity dwarf ellipticals . 
 in contrast , in a binary model , the uv - upturn is universal and can account for uv - upturns from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals . 
 by applying the binary scenario of han et  al .   for the formation of hot subdwarfs 
 , we have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the uv - upturn of elliptical galaxies based on a first - principle approach . 
 the model is still quite simple and does not take into account more complex star - formation histories , possible contributions to the uv from agn activity , non - solar metallicity or a range of metallicities . moreover , the binary population synthesis is sensitive to uncertainties in the binary modelling itself , in particular the mass - ratio distribution and the condition for stable and unstable mass transfer @xcite . 
 we have varied these parameters and found these uncertainties do not change the qualitative picture , but affect some of the quantitative estimates .    despite its simplicity , our model can successfully reproduce most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a uv excess : the range of observed uv excesses , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g.  deharveng , boselli & donas , 2002 ) , and their evolution with redshift . the model predicts that the uv excess is not a strong function of age , and hence is not a good indicator for the age of the dominant old population , as has been argued previously @xcite , but is very consistent with recent galex findings @xcite . 
 we typically find that the @xmath0 colour changes rapidly over the first 1gyr and only varies slowly thereafter . 
 this also implies that all old galaxies should show a uv excess at some level . 
 moreover , we expect that the model is not very sensitive to the metallicity of the population . 
 the uv - upturn is therefore expected to be universal .    our model is sensitive to both low levels and high levels of star formation . 
 it suggests that elliptical galaxies had some star formation activity in the relatively recent past ( @xmath162gyr ago ) . 
 agn and supernova activity may provide supporting evidence for this picture . 
 the modelling of the uv excess presented in this study is only a starting point : with refinements in the spectral modelling , including metallicity effects , and more detailed modelling of the global evolution of the stellar population in elliptical galaxies , we propose that this becomes a powerful new tool helping to unravel the complex histories of elliptical galaxies that a long time ago looked so simple and straightforward .

62,"multivariate statistical methods have been used for many decades to deal with situations in which two or more variables are measured or recorded for each unit . 
 a classical example of this situation is guerry s data set , in which several variables meant to capture `` moral qualities '' ( e.g. , literacy , crime rate , suicide rate ) were tabulated for each of the departments in which france was divided at the time ( 1833 ) . 
 this data set suggests that one can be interested in how the variables change as one moves around in france , or one can be interested in how the departments compare to each other based on the measured characteristics . 
 it is of special interest how these two approaches can be combined ; this is considered in detail in @xcite .    besides having a combination of two essentially multidimensional sources of information , like geographic location plus recorded data , another layer of complexity 
 is added when one more variable like time is added , leading to what essentially are two or more data cubes . 
 a typical example of this is ecological data , where species abundances are measured at different , specified locations , over the course of time . 
 the different approaches used in this setting are reviewed in @xcite , using the duality diagram setting as a unifying framework . 
 such an approach is not limited to animal or plant species spread over a  geographic area ; the advent of _ metagenomics _ has made it possible to study the abundances of bacterial species in locations like ocean or pond water , or even the human gut . in this case 
 it becomes important to incorporate information not only about location in space , but also in the phylogenetic landscape , by using established or inferred phylogenetic trees for the bacterial species detected . 
 this problem is addressed , using the duality diagram formalism , in @xcite .    as an outgrowth of methods favored by french statisticians 
 , @xcite proposed a unifying framework capable of including many methods reinvented and used by different groups in different countries as special cases . 
 this framework is based on the analysis of certain linear operators between inner - product spaces which can be naturally associated to a data matrix , in the same way kernel matrices are used today in machine learning @xcite . 
 this is explained in detail in works like @xcite and @xcite . in this article 
 we present some motivations behind the choices made for this approach in the accompanying papers . 
 the notion of duality is everywhere in mathematics , appearing under different guises in the most diverse fields ; and it is often remarkably useful . 
 the idea of duality was introduced in the analysis of multivariate data by the french school of data analysts as a way to unify a suite of methods that turned out to be exactly or almost exactly equivalent to methods known by a different name , and the duality - diagram formalism provides a simple way to put all these methods in the same context . 
 since this approach is the basis of the special articles presented together here [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , this short introduction aims to establish the basic facts and notation . 
 the abstract approach in the duality diagram setup is often intimidating and it possibly turns away some interested readers ; we hope we can show here that these notions are actually natural , and that the overhead due in understanding the notation pays off handsomely in the breadth and complexity of applications . 
 today the distinction between the space of rows of the matrix as a sample from a population and the space of columns as the fixed variables on which the observations were measured has been softened and we often hear the term ` transposable ' data . 
 the definitions presented here explain this row - column duality .    by dispensing of the traditional probabilistic sample - population interpretation 
 , european data analysts in the 1970s [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] can be seen in hindsight as precursors of the current machine learning schools . 
 it is interesting to remember that all these schools had precursors who spent time at the at&t laboratories in new jersey at a time when john tukey was active there . 
 consider an @xmath0 matrix @xmath1 containing data for variables @xmath2 collected from @xmath3 individuals or units . 
 this matrix defines an operator @xmath4 by the rule @xmath5 . 
 what interpretation can we give to such a map ? 
 the vector @xmath6 can be considered to contain the coefficients for linearly combining the variables @xmath2 into a new , synthetic , variable . in that sense 
 , it becomes apparent that actually we should consider this a map from @xmath7 , the dual space of @xmath8 , into @xmath9 . 
 the map @xmath10 provides a way to fill in the @xmath3 values for the new synthetic variable @xmath11 , which could have been defined even before collecting the data . from now on we will abuse notation and identify the operator @xmath12 and the matrix @xmath1 ( and will do the same with other similarly defined operators and matrices ) . 
 we have then the following portion of the diagram : @xmath13^{\mathbf{x } } & \mathbb{r}^n . } \ ] ]      recall that the adjoint of a linear transformation @xmath14 between inner product spaces is defined as the mapping @xmath15 that satisfies @xmath16 ( for simplicity , we will only consider spaces with scalars in @xmath17 in this article ; this is enough for most data analyses ) . 
 this can be seen as just a clever way of extending the notion of matrix transpose to a more general setting , but it is actually a powerful formalism , especially when dealing with multiple inner products on the same spaces ( notice that @xmath18 depends not only on @xmath19 but also on @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . 
 it is convenient sometimes to think of @xmath18 as a map from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ; this matches the corresponding situation when it is generalized to banach spaces . in our setting this distinction might be considered moot , since all spaces considered are naturally isomorphic to their duals , but we will continue using the star notation ; the diagrams , and all the matrix operations obtained from them , work equally well if the stars are dropped from the spaces . 
 then we have the following : @xmath24^{\mathbf{x } } & \mathbb{r}^n \ar@{=}[d]_{\wr}\\ % { x}^*(=\mathbf{x}^t ) } % } \ ] ] since we are considering the standard inner products on @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( and their dual spaces ) , @xmath25 corresponds just to the transpose @xmath26 of @xmath1 . 
 thus , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , these two symmetric matrices have the same eigenvalues ( except possibly for zeros to account for the difference between  @xmath29 and @xmath3 ) , and the two sets of eigenvectors can be used to form the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath1 [ @xcite ] . 
 consider now the situation where the inner products ( i.e. , the geometries ) on @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not standard . 
 that is , assume that there are symmetric , positive definite matrices  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 such that the inner products @xmath32 and @xmath33 somehow make more sense for a particular data analysis than the standard inner products . 
 a typical example is when @xmath34 is a diagonal matrix of ( positive ) weights , one for each individual , down - weighting individuals that are known to have been measured with a larger error ; another example is when @xmath35 is the diagonal matrix containing the reciprocals of the sample variances for the columns of @xmath1 , which corresponds to standardizing the variables ( assuming they are already centered ) ; a  related example is when @xmath35 is the inverse of the sample variance  covariance matrix obtained from @xmath1 , in which case the new geometry corresponds to the _ mahalanobis distance_. often , we want to consider the case in which @xmath36 and we are interested in a set @xmath37 of transformed variables obtained from @xmath38 by multiplication by @xmath39 , leading to a transformed data matrix @xmath40 . 
 different multivariate procedures can be obtained by appropriately choosing @xmath35 and @xmath34 ; see section [ section : particular - cases ] for some examples .    instead of @xmath1 and its adjoint 
 , consider now the transformation @xmath41 . 
 that is , a vector @xmath42 of coefficients is first transformed into @xmath43 , which is in the scale of the transformed data matrix @xmath40 , and then used to create a linear combination of the variables @xmath44 . 
 then , for all @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 so @xmath48 . then , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are self - adjoint operators on @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , but they are not necessarily symmetric matrices . 
 nevertheless , they have real eigenvalues ( which match , except for zeros to account for the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath3 ) , because they are similar to symmetric matrices by way of positive definite matrices ; for example , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is obtained by replacing each eigenvalue @xmath55 of @xmath35 with @xmath56 . 
 the eigenvectors of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are also real ; however , they need not be orthogonal . 
 nevertheless , the eigenvectors of @xmath59 can be taken to be orthogonal with respect to @xmath60 , and those of @xmath61 to be orthogonal with respect to @xmath62 . 
 ( this can be interpreted as leading to a  generalized version of the svd . )    in diagram form , we have the following : @xmath63^{\mathbf{x } } & \mathbb{r}^n \ar[d]^{\mathbf{d } } % & { \mathbb{r}^n}^ * \ar[l]^{\mathbf{x}^t } % } \ ] ] this way , the triplet of matrices @xmath64 defines a multivariate data analysis setup , in which the main strategy is the computation of the eigendecompositions of the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath61 . 
 it is also customary to denote @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so that the two operators of interest become @xmath67 and @xmath68 . 
 the eigendecomposition can be computed for the smaller of the two matrices ( which is usually much smaller than the other ) , and , if needed , the eigenvectors for the other one can be easily obtained : for example , if @xmath69 , then @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71 furthermore , orthogonality is also preserved among eigenvectors : if @xmath72 are @xmath35-orthogonal eigenvectors for @xmath57 , then @xmath73 thus , whole eigendecompositions are easily transferred . 
 the operator @xmath61 can be seen as a precursor of the more general kernel matrices used in today s kernel pca type methods [ @xcite ] .    in the kernel approach to data analysis 
 one assumes that the data is provided as a @xmath74 matrix @xmath75 containing proximity scores for each pair of individuals ; these scores might have been computed from measured variables ( as in the case of the matrix @xmath58 , the _ linear kernel _ ; nonlinear functions of the variables offer a great variety of other possibilities ) , or by directly comparing the individuals ; see @xcite for a review of the theory and examples of applications in computational biology . 
 kernel matrices are similarity matrices , that is , the proximity score for two individuals is high when they are similar and low ( even negative ) when they are dissimilar . 
 ( distance matrices , on the other hand , have higher values for dissimilar pairs of individuals . ) 
 what is the meaning of @xmath75 as an operator on @xmath9 ? 
 a useful interpretation is to consider it as a smoothing operator acting on real - valued functions @xmath76 defined on the set of individuals : the value of @xmath77 at the @xmath78th individual is a weighted sum of all the values of @xmath76 , with higher weights for those individuals more similar to the @xmath78th ; in other words , @xmath76 is averaged locally ( up to a multiplicative constant ) . 
 this offers one explanation of why the eigendecomposition of @xmath75 is useful , since repeated application of @xmath75 to @xmath79 ( which should produce a very smooth function ) converges toward an eigenvector of the leading eigenvalue , and `` very smooth '' functions of the data points can be used as coordinates . 
 @xcite explores the similarities between the duality diagram and kernel approaches in appendix b , for the case of kernel canonical correspondence analysis . 
 here we briefly describe how some well - known multivariate methods can be expressed as particular cases of the duality diagram , by appropriately choosing @xmath35 and @xmath34 . 
 we will assume that @xmath1 is centered by columns ( i.e. , the mean has been subtracted for each variable ) . 
 pca seeks to find linear combinations of the variables that explain most of the variability in the data ; see @xcite , for example , for more details . 
 take @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . 
 this corresponds to pca in the original scales ; it is equivalent to a straightforward svd on @xmath1 ( except for the factor  @xmath82 ) . 
 if one standardizes the variables , as it is often appropriate to eliminate unit scale effects , then @xmath35 is taken to be the diagonal matrix containing the reciprocals of the sample variances of the columns of @xmath1 ( so @xmath39 contains the reciprocals of the standard deviations ) . while the @xmath78th eigenvector @xmath83 of the ( @xmath34-weighted ) sample covariance matrix @xmath84 provides the loadings of the variables @xmath44 for the @xmath78th principal component ( so that the actual components have to be obtained by @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 can be obtained directly as an eigenvector for @xmath61 : indeed , @xmath87 computing the principal components @xmath86 does not require the explicit decomposition of @xmath35 as @xmath88 . 
 a total of @xmath89 observations are classified according to two categorical variables , one with @xmath3 categories or levels , and the other with @xmath29 , producing a @xmath0 matrix @xmath90 of counts for each combination of levels ( a _ contingency table _ ) . 
 one wants to study how the counts differ from the expected counts under the assumption of independence between the two variables . to cast ca as a duality diagram 
 , we first define the frequency matrix @xmath91 and the marginal frequency vectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; then , the expected counts ( conditionally on the marginals ) are given by @xmath94 . 
 using the matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we can standardize @xmath97 by @xmath98 the matrix @xmath1 seems like a reasonable choice to study by eigendecomposition . 
 however , all rows and columns have been reduced to the same importance , while , heuristically , categories with larger marginal counts should provide more accurate information on the distribution of the other variable , and thus should be given greater weight . 
 this can be achieved by defining the triplet @xmath99 . 
 notice that actually @xmath1 is centered by rows and by columns with respect to the inner products given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 . 
 this approach matches the traditional definition of ca . 
 @xcite shows how the information about relationships between the rows of the contingency table can be incorporated into the duality diagram in the special case where there are binary trees that connects the rows of the abundance matrix . 
 the study of variability of one continuous variable is done through the use of the variance ; this notion is generalized in several different directions to accommodate the complexities of dealing with multiple tables , graphs , etc . 
 , through the concept of inertia . as in physics 
 , we define inertia as a weighted sum of squared distances of the weighted points . for each of the diagrams studied above 
 , the inertia designates the trace of the operator @xmath102 , and we have @xmath103 . as pointed out in @xcite , in the case of ca , the inertia is proportional to the @xmath104 statistic , whereas in ordinary pca it is just the total variance of all the variables . in discriminant analysis , 
 the inertia is decomposed into between - groups and within - group components ; these are also used in the bca analysis [ @xcite , @xcite ] . 
 the weighted distances between columns have another interpretation in ecology and @xcite shows how they can be associated to different measures of diversity . 
 the decomposition of total inertia can be seen as a generalization to manova which is the special case of a variance decomposition . 
 @xcite uses this effectively to show how to decompose the total diversity across all locations into the average diversity of individual locations and plus the average of pairwise dissimilarities of locations . 
 @xcite use similar decompositions to show what part of the inertia can be assigned to spatially local variation in their bca approach to multivariate spatial data . 
 they also show how the graphical relationships between rows can be encoded in a special metric @xmath34 built from the weighted connectivity matrix . 
 ( in their paper , they call these weights @xmath105 . ) 
 interesting results can be obtained by combining two or more triplets . 
 the usual assumption is that two ( or more ) sets of variables are measured on the same set of  @xmath3 individuals ; thus , the matrix @xmath34 is assumed to be common , but each set of variables has its own version of @xmath35 , of the appropriate size .    for example , one of the triplets might contain data from variables measured on each of the individuals , while the other might encode known relationships between the individuals . 
 a key element in the comparison of the operators arising from two duality diagrams is the rv coefficient . 
 it can be considered as a generalization of the squared correlation coefficient by using the froebenius matrix product .    given two symmetric matrices @xmath106 of the same size , 
 we define @xmath107 , and @xmath108 whenever @xmath109 . many nice properties of these definitions arise from the fact that @xmath110 defines an inner product on the vector space of symmetric matrices of a given size . 
 this can be adapted to the general setting of multiple duality diagrams : having @xmath34 fixed , call @xmath111 the vector space of @xmath34-symmetric matrices , that is , matrices satisfying @xmath112 ( equivalently ,  @xmath113 is self - adjoint with respect to @xmath114 ) . 
 then @xmath110 defines an inner product on @xmath111 . 
 when comparing two duality diagrams @xmath115 , then numbers @xmath116 of variables might be different , yielding matrices @xmath117 of different size ; however , we will be comparing the matrices ( operators )  @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which are of the same size and @xmath34-symmetric . 
 we define the rv coefficient of the two diagrams as @xmath120 . 
 some immediate properties of the rv coefficient are as follows : its values are always in @xmath121 $ ] ; it equals 1 only when @xmath122 , for some nonzero scalar  @xmath123 ; and it equals 0 only when @xmath124 ( provided @xmath125 are nonsingular ) . 
 the proofs are not too hard ; more details can be found in @xcite .    the rv coefficient between diagrams ( or triplets ) 
 can be used for justifying the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this setting . 
 for example , performing pca based on @xmath64 and selecting the @xmath126 top components is equivalent to finding a matrix @xmath127 such that the rv coefficient between @xmath64 and @xmath128 is maximized . 
 when one data set  @xmath129 has the special status of a response that we would like to predict or explain from the other data set @xmath1 of explanatory variables , we can generalize ordinary regression to a multivariate response through the same diagram framework . 
 this is called _ pca with respect to instrumental variables _ , abbreviated pca - iv ( also known as redundancy analysis , rda ) , first described by @xcite . in terms of the comparison of duality diagrams and rv coefficients , this problem can be rephrased as that of finding the metric @xmath130 to associate to @xmath1 so that @xmath131 is _ as close as possible _ to @xmath132 in the rv sense . 
 that is , we want to maximize @xmath133 . 
 we abbreviate the cross - products by writing @xmath134 and @xmath135 then for any @xmath136 @xmath137 the first term on the right - hand side does not depend on @xmath130 , and the second term will be zero for the choice @xmath138 .    if we add the extra constraint that we only allow ourselves a rank @xmath126 approximation , with @xmath139 , the optimal choice of a  positive definite matrix @xmath130 is to take @xmath140 where the columns of  @xmath141 are the eigenvectors of @xmath142 with @xmath143 the pca with regards to instrumental variables of rank @xmath126 is equivalent to the pca of rank @xmath126 of the triple @xmath144 where @xmath145      consider @xmath146 diagrams @xmath147 . 
 this could correspond , for example , to @xmath146 different studies on the same subjects , using different variables , or the same variables measured on the same units at different points in time ( time course study ) ; a review of this problem in the setting of community ecology is found in @xcite . 
 it is often important to summarize the relationships between the diagrams in a compact and intelligible way . 
 the rv coefficients in fact allow us to consider this as performing a pca of the pcas . 
 we compute the multivariate correlation coefficients between tables and use those as the matrix to be diagonalized , similarly to what happens in ordinary pca . 
 the values of the pairwise computations of the covv and rv coefficients are arranged into @xmath148 symmetric matrices @xmath149 and @xmath136 , respectively , and the eigendecomposition of these matrices can lead to useful low - dimensional representations , just as in the case of pca using the covariance or correlation matrices , respectively . in this case , a 2- or 3-dimensional plot can be created in which each point represents one of the studies ( diagrams ) .    furthermore , since @xmath149 and @xmath136 have nonnegative entries , the eigenvector @xmath150 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue can be taken to have only nonnegative entries , adding up to 1 . then , defining @xmath151 , the operator @xmath68 can be taken as a compromise or summary of all the diagrams , and one can study how far , in the rv sense , different studies are from the compromise . 
 these steps are part of the so - called statis procedure [ @xcite ] . 
 one can think of these data sets as a data cube , with three indices ; then a  similar procedure can be used to compare two or more such cubes . 
 the duality diagram is a useful formalism that allows one to easily compare many classical multivariate methods , revealing what they have in common and where they differ . 
 but , furthermore , it has become a valuable tool for dealing with two problems that have become very common : ( 1 ) combining and amalgamating data which , although collected from different sources and using different methods , shed light on different aspects of the same phenomenon ; and ( 2 ) taking advantage of complex , nontraditional data types , like tree and network information . 
 these two problems are closely related , as the data to be amalgamated are often of complex type . 
 the overhead in effort to understand the abstract definitions in the duality diagram approach to data analysis is amply offset by the clearer picture that is gained and by the wealth of applications that become available . in this article 
 we have tried to reduce that overhead by laying out arguments that show that those definitions are actually quite natural . 
 the three articles [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] in this group are excellent examples of the power of this approach , but are only a small sample from a large and growing body of work . 
 most of the methods presented in these papers have been coded into functions for the statistical computation environment r [ @xcite ] , many available in the library ` ade4 ` , for which exemplary presentations have been published [ see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . in the case of @xcite , you can even run in an interactive way through all the commands generating each and every plot through the reproducible website at http://pbil.univ - lyon1.fr / saoasopet/.      baty , f. , facompr , m. , wiegand , j. , schwager , j. and brutsche , m.

63,"a number of experimental techniques have emerged in recent years which enable studies of the structure and dynamics of electrode - electrolyte interfaces _ in situ _ , i.e. , without removing the electrode from the liquid @xcite . 
 this new atomic scale information allows greater understanding of the deposition process where , in contrast to high - vacuum surface - science methods , the electrochemical environment provides direct experimental control over the electrochemical potentials of the adsorbates , rather than over their coverages or fluxes . 
 these new _ in situ _ experimental techniques , together with new methods to manipulate adsorbates at the interface on the nanometer scale @xcite , promise to make electrodeposition an even more important method for low - cost , high - quality materials synthesis than it is today @xcite . 
 these developments emphasize the importance of developing theoretical and computational methods to study the dynamical aspects of electrodeposition in microscopic detail .    motivated by these developments in electrochemical surface science , we here present a static and dynamic monte carlo ( mc ) simulation study of a simple system which can serve as a prototype for more complicated ones of applied interest . 
 this system is a submonolayer of br electrodeposited onto a single - crystal ag(100 ) electrode . 
 recently it was investigated at room temperature by _ in - situ _ surface x - ray scattering ( sxs ) and chronocoulometry by ocko , wang , and wandlowski @xcite . 
 that study detected a second - order phase transition between a disordered low - coverage phase at more negative electrode potentials and a doubly degenerate c@xmath0 ordered phase with coverage @xmath1 at more positive potentials . 
 ( this phase has also been observed by low - energy electron scattering ( leed ) for br adsorbed on ag(100 ) in vacuum @xcite . ) 
 the transition was shown to belong to the two - dimensional ising universality class @xcite . 
 the scattering data @xcite also indicate that br adsorbs at the four - fold hollow sites between the surface ag atoms , consistent with recent _ in situ _ x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) results @xcite . 
 the fluctuations around the adsorption sites are small , suggesting that a lattice - gas approximation for the adlayer structure and dynamics is appropriate . here 
 we investigate in detail such a lattice - gas model with a nearest - neighbor excluded - volume interaction and lateral dipole - dipole repulsive interactions @xcite . the dipole interaction strength and the electrosorption valency , which are parameters of the model , 
 are estimated by fitting simulated equilibrium adsorption isotherms to experimental chronocoulometric data @xcite . 
 cyclic voltammograms ( cvs ) at room temperature show two main features @xcite : a broad shoulder at more negative potentials which ends in a sharp peak at more positive potentials . by sxs 
 it was confirmed that the sharp peak corresponds to a second - order phase transition in the layer of adsorbed br @xcite . 
 however , the cause of the broad shoulder has been less clear . 
 it was previously suggested @xcite that interactions with surface water are responsible for the shoulder , but equilibrium mc simulations by koper @xcite , as well as our own work , show the same features in simulations without water . 
 we show here that the broad shoulder in the simulated cv is due to fluctuations within the disordered adlayer . 
 locally , these fluctuations resemble other ordered phases with coverage 1/4 , which exist in the model at much lower temperatures .    going beyond these equilibrium simulations , 
 we further present a dynamic mc study of the ordering and disordering processes between the disordered phase and the c@xmath0 phase , assuming a perfectly stirred solution so that bulk diffusion effects can be ignored . for ordering 
 , we expect similar behavior to the random sequential adsorption process of the hard - square model with lateral diffusion @xcite . at late stages of the ordering , this dynamic model is expected to be in the same dynamic universality class as the ferromagnetic @xcite or antiferromagnetic @xcite ising model in zero magnetic field following sudden cooling from infinite temperature to a temperature below the critical point . 
 these phase ordering dynamics with non - conserved order parameter , often called model a in the literature on dynamics of phase ordering and phase separation @xcite , are driven by the reduction of interface curvature @xcite . 
 we further present dynamic results for the disordering process and discuss how simulation results for this process can be compared with experiment . 
 we also apply the dynamic mc algorithm to study sweep - rate dependence in simulated cv experiments . 
 results are presented for the response of the system to a wide range of sweep rates , and we suggest some comparisons between simulation results and experiment . some preliminary results of this study were included in refs .

 the sign convention used here is such that @xmath12 denotes a repulsive interaction , and @xmath13 favors adsorption . 
 we measure @xmath9 and @xmath11 in units of mev / pair and mev / particle , respectively . 
 [ for brevity we write both simply as mev . ] 
 the electrochemical potential @xmath11 is the intensive variable which controls the average number of br in the adlayer . in the weak - solution approximation 
 it is related to the electrode potential by @xmath14}{[c_{0 } ] } - e\gamma e   \;,\ ] ] where @xmath15 is an arbitrary reference level , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath17 is the absolute temperature , @xmath18 is the elementary charge unit , @xmath19 $ ] is the concentration of br@xmath20 in solution , @xmath21 $ ] is an arbitrary reference concentration ( here we use @xmath22  mm ) , @xmath23 is the electrosorption valency ( @xmath24 is the charge transfered through the external circuit for each br ion adsorbed on the electrode @xcite ) , and @xmath25 is the electrode potential in mv .    a variety of lateral interactions have been previously explored for this model , including finite and infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion and screened dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . from these previous studies and our own exploratory simulations , we find that the interactions are quite adequately described with a nearest - neighbor excluded - volume interaction ( infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion ) related to the large ionic radius of br@xmath20 ( 1.96   @xcite ) , plus a long - range dipole - dipole repulsion . 
 the pairwise lateral interactions used here are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the separation of an interacting br pair within the adlayer , measured in units of the ag(100 ) lattice spacing ( @xmath28   @xcite ) , and @xmath29 ( which is negative ) is the lateral dipole - dipole repulsion between next - nearest neighbors . 
 in other work it has been noticed that reducing the infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion to finite but large values has very little effect on the isotherms @xcite . 
 all interactions are truncated beyond five lattice spacings to simplify computation . 
 this truncation can be seen as an approximate cut - off due to screening . with this cut - off , the total interaction energy of a fully ordered c@xmath30 phase is approximately @xmath31 of the interaction energy without a cut - off . 
 the ag(100 ) substrate provides a square adsorption lattice of hollow sites for the commensurate br adlayer . 
 the nearest - neighbor excluded - volume interactions give rise to two different sublattices which have a geometry corresponding to the two colors on a checkerboard . 
 each of the two degenerate c@xmath0 phases can occupy only one of the two sublattices , which we label @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the @xmath32 sublattice coverage is the fraction of occupied sites on sublattice @xmath32 , defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of sites on sublattice @xmath32 and @xmath36 denotes a sum over all sites on that sublattice . the @xmath33 sublattice coverage , @xmath37 , is analogously defined . for this system , there are two linearly independent observables of interest : the total br coverage , @xmath38 , and the staggered coverage , @xmath39 , which is the order parameter for the c@xmath0 phase . 
 monte carlo simulations were performed at room temperature ( @xmath40  mev , corresponding to @xmath41  k ) to determine the equilibrium properties of the br adlayer for different values of @xmath11 . for these equilibrium simulations 
 , we used the metropolis algorithm @xcite with single - site updates at randomly selected sites . 
 the main purpose of these equilibrium simulations was to obtain adsorption isotherms for parameter estimation by fitting to experimental data . 
 the most important region of comparison is in the disordered phase , where the fluctuations are small . 
 it was therefore sufficient to use relatively small systems with @xmath4232 . 
 no significant differences were noticed between data for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see below ) . 
 no systematic finite - size scaling was performed near the phase transition . 
 thus , the results obtained in the critical region are only approximate .    for a given temperature and chemical potential 
 , we generated a set of samples from which we computed the averages @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes an average over a set of statistically independent equilibrium samples . 
 for convenience , we drop the @xmath47 notation for the equilibrium isotherms . 
 the critical value of the electrochemical potential and the shape of the adsorption isotherm in the disordered phase are quite sensitive to the strength of the long - range repulsive interactions . to determine the dipole interaction strength , @xmath29 , and the electrosorption valency , @xmath23 , we therefore simultaneously compared the simulated room - temperature adsorption isotherm , @xmath48 , with experimental isotherms , @xmath49 , obtained from chronocoulometry @xcite . 
 the nonlinear fitting method is described in the appendix . 
 the resulting parameter values are @xmath50  mev , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  mev . 
 these results are consistent with those found previously by others @xcite    the fitted mc isotherm is shown together with the chronocoulometric coverage isotherms in fig . 
 [ fig : exp ] . for the two lowest concentrations , 
 the agreement is very good over the whole range of electrode potentials , while the agreement in the ordered phase is somewhat less satisfactory for the highest concentration . 
 this disagreement at higher concentrations suggests a break - down in the weak - solution approximation and the ultimate need for a more detailed treatment of the solution . 
 figure  [ fig : isoth ] shows the simulated @xmath48 and @xmath53 at @xmath54  k , with @xmath55  mev as obtained from the fits to the experimental isotherms . 
 the order parameter , @xmath56 , is zero in the disordered phase , while it is near @xmath57 deep in either of the two degenerate ordered phases . 
 a second - order phase transition between the low - coverage disordered phase and the c@xmath0 ordered phase is observed at a critical electrochemical potential , @xmath58  mev . as @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xcite , as expected for the ising universality class . 
 the coverage isotherm shows a long , gradual slope in the disordered phase , which is not present in a model with only nearest - neighbor exclusion ( called the hard - square ( hs ) model ) @xcite . as a result 
 , @xmath61 is considerably larger than that of the pure hard - square model , @xmath62  mev @xcite  mev is obtained as @xmath63 , using precise numerical values for the critical activity of the hard - square model , @xmath64 @xcite and @xmath65 @xcite , obtained by series expansions and transfer - matrix finite - size scaling , respectively . ] . the simulated and experimental isotherms show coverages at @xmath61 of about @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . within statistical errors , this is the same result as the pure hard - square model , @xmath68 @xcite @xcite and @xmath69 @xcite . ] . 
 the adsorption isotherm , @xmath48 , has its maximum slope at @xmath61 . 
 corresponding maxima in the slopes are also seen in the experimental isotherms in fig . 
 [ fig : exp ] . 
 simulation data are included in fig . 
 [ fig : isoth ] for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 . on the scale of this figure , 
 differences between the two sizes are visible only in the data for @xmath70 very close to @xmath61 , where @xmath71 is expected to diverge with increasing @xmath72 as @xmath73 @xcite in a finite system of size @xmath72 , @xmath74 , where @xmath23 and @xmath75 are the critical exponents for the ordering susceptibility and the correlation length , respectively . 
 for the two - dimensional ising model @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite . ] . 
 a quasi - equilibrium cv ( the cv in the limit of vanishing potential sweep rate ) can be obtained from the simulated equilibrium isotherm using the simple relation , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the voltammetric current density ( oxidation currents positive ) , @xmath80 is the total number of adsorption sites per unit area ( @xmath81 sites/@xmath82 @xcite ) , and @xmath83 is the sweep rate . 
 figure  [ fig : qcv ] shows @xmath84 , which exhibits the same broad shoulder and sharp peak seen in experimental cvs @xcite . 
 the shoulder has previously been attributed to interactions with surface water @xcite . 
 however , the fact that the lattice - gas model does not contain explicit water molecules indicates that the shoulder is most likely caused by configurational fluctuations in the br adlayer , as was also pointed out by koper @xcite . 
 differences between the simulation data for @xmath43 and 128 are only visible near the peak , which is expected to diverge logarithmically with @xmath72 @xcite @xmath85 is expected to be proportional to the heat capacity of the adlayer . 
 the heat capacity of the two - dimensional ising model diverges logarithmically with @xmath72 @xcite . ] . 
 this quasi - equilibrium cv is compared with dynamically simulated cvs for different potential sweep rates in sec . 
 [ sec : cv ] . 
 having obtained an estimate for the lateral interaction constant by equilibrium simulations at room temperature , we briefly explore the full phase diagram of the model with this interaction strength , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : pd ] . 
 we expect the phase diagram for this system to be topologically similar to that for the hard - square model with next - nearest neighbor repulsion @xcite ( even though the low - coverage ordered phases in the two systems are different ) . 
 in addition to the disordered phase and the two equilibrium ordered phases [ the low - temperature c@xmath86 phase with @xmath87 and the c@xmath0 phase with @xmath88 which is observed at all temperatures for sufficiently large @xmath89 , there is also a metastable phase , p@xmath0 with @xmath87 , which lies closely above the c@xmath86 phase in energy . to facilitate equilibration at low temperatures , 
 in this simulation we used a heat - bath algorithm which updates clusters @xcite consisting of randomly chosen nearest - neighbor pairs of sites . 
 the presence of the p@xmath0 phase made low - temperature equilibration very difficult , even with the pair - update algorithm . 
 other phases with @xmath90 probably also exist as a consequence of the long - range repulsion ; however , we expect these phases to be present only at extremely low temperatures , and their effects should be negligible at room temperature . 
 the phase boundaries have been determined by ground - state calculations for @xmath91 , by the location of the sharp peak in the quasi - equilibrium cv for @xmath92  k , and by inspection of the pair - update mc sample configurations for @xmath93  k.    the broad shoulder in the cv is caused by configurational fluctuations in the disordered phase , which locally resemble the @xmath87 phases @xcite . at the experimentally unrealistic low temperatures where the c@xmath86 phase is observed in the model , the shoulder breaks up into two transitions between the disordered phase and the c@xmath86 phase . 
 although the c@xmath86 phase is not experimentally observable in this system , local fluctuations which resemble the @xmath87 phases can be seen in the model in equilibrium at room temperature and should be observable in the diffuse intensity of sxs experiments . 
 we therefore next present simulated equilibrium sxs intensities in the room - temperature disordered phase at @xmath94 . 
 we define the structure factor as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the squared absolute value of the complex fourier transform of the real - space adlayer configuration @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the wave vector in the plane of the adlayer ( given in units of the inverse lattice constant , @xmath99 ) . 
 equivalently , @xmath100 can be expressed as the fourier transform of the adsorbate correlation function , @xmath101 . 
 the fourier transform is normalized such that @xmath102 . in the born approximation , 
 the structure factor is proportional to the sxs intensity @xcite . in fig . 
 [ fig : eqs](a ) and ( b ) we show the simulated structure factor for the disordered room - temperature phase at @xmath103  mev , where @xmath94 . 
 small domains of c@xmath0 , c@xmath86 , and p@xmath0 symmetry are noticeable in snapshots of the adsorbate configurations [ fig . 
 [ fig : eqs](c ) ] , and they also affect the simulated diffuse scattering intensity . referring to fig .  [ 
 fig : eqs](b ) , bragg peaks would occur at the points marked @xmath104 for a fully ordered @xmath105 phase , at the points marked @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and at the points marked @xmath108 for @xmath109 . due to the disorder , all of these peaks [ except for the one at @xmath110 are very broad and combine to give the anisotropic diffuse scattering intensity shown in the figure . 
 the individual peaks would become narrower and more distinct at temperatures less than room temperature ( but still above the critical temperature for the low - temperature ordered phase ) or with stronger dipole - dipole interactions . 
 next we investigate the dynamics of the br adlayer using a dynamic mc algorithm . 
 the microscopic processes considered are adsorption / desorption , in which a particle enters or leaves the adlayer , as well as nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor lateral diffusion . 
 the thermally activated , stochastic barrier - hopping picture of the microscopic dynamics used here is described in further detail elsewhere @xcite . 
 we assume a simple linear form for the local energy landscape , which is equivalent to the butler - volmer approximation with symmetry parameter 1/2 @xcite . 
 see fig . 
 [ fig : barr ] . the initial and final states , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , 
 respectively , are represented by lattice - gas configurations and differ by a single microscopic move . 
 we label each type of microscopic move ( adsorption , desorption , nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor diffusion ) by the index @xmath113 . 
 the state @xmath114 represents an intermediate transition state of higher energy between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which is associated with the move @xmath113 . 
 this intermediate state can not be represented by a lattice - gas configuration , and we associate with it a `` bare '' barrier @xmath115 . the energy of the transition state is then approximated as + @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 are the energies of the states @xmath114 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , respectively .    although other choices of the transition probability are used in the literature as well @xcite , we here approximate the probability per mc step per site ( mcss ) of making a transition from @xmath111 to @xmath112 by the simple one - step arrhenius rate @xcite @xmath120 where the rate constant @xmath75 ( in units of ( mcss)@xmath121 ) sets the overall time scale for the simulation and is assumed to be the same for all microscopic processes . 
 dynamic monte carlo steps proceed in the following way . 
 first , a lattice site @xmath6 is randomly selected . if @xmath6 is empty , only adsorption may be attempted . 
 if @xmath6 is occupied , both desorption and lateral diffusion may be attempted . in general , 
 some moves will be excluded by the presence of other adatoms ( corresponding to @xmath122 ) . 
 next , a weighted list is constructed of new potential configurations @xmath112 which would result from successfully attempting each of the allowed moves for site @xmath6 . the probability to undergo each transition 
 is then calculated from eq . 
 ( [ eq : dynrate ] ) . 
 blocked moves have transition probability zero . to ensure microscopic reversibility ( detailed balance ) , the possibility that no change in configuration occurs ( @xmath123 ) 
 must also be included in the list of new configurations . 
 the probability to remain in the initial state is @xmath124 .    in general 
 , there is a possibility that @xmath125 could be negative . 
 however , this essentially means that the time corresponding to one mcss is chosen too long for a consistent stochastic description . 
 thus , @xmath75 must be chosen sufficiently small that @xmath126 remains positive . 
 as long as this condition is satisfied , changing @xmath75 only corresponds to changing the overall time scale for the simulation . in our simulations we used @xmath77  ( mcss)@xmath121 , which ensured that @xmath126 remained positive with the barriers used here . 
 the main price paid for the simplicity of coding our algorithm is that it is rather slow in parameter regimes where the acceptance probabilities are very low . 
 however , except for extremely _ fast _ processes , in which the acceptance probabilities are large and change significantly within a single mcss , it is equivalent to more sophisticated continuum - time algorithms @xcite .    the adsorption / desorption barrier is @xmath127 , the nearest - neighbor diffusion barrier is @xmath128 , and the next - nearest neighbor diffusion barrier is @xmath129 . in the simulations , 
 the diffusion barriers are @xmath130  mev and @xmath131  mev , based on _ ab - initio _ 
 calculations @xcite of binding energies for a single br ion to a ag(100 ) substrate in vacuum . the barrier @xmath128 is approximated by the difference in binding energy between the four - fold hollow site and the bridge site , while @xmath129 is approximated by the difference in binding energy between the four - fold hollow site and the on - top site . 
 theoretical estimates of @xmath127 are extremely sensitive to the details of both the ion - surface and ion - water interactions @xcite . based on data from calculations of the potential of mean force for halide ions in water near a cu(100 ) surface @xcite , 
 our very rough estimates indicate that values between 200 and 500  mev are not unreasonable . since we also expect @xmath127 to be significantly larger than @xmath129 , we examined some aspects of the behavior for @xmath132  mev and @xmath133  mev . 
 finding few qualitative differences between simulation results for these two values , we chose the lower value , @xmath132  mev , to increase the simulation speed . 
 one way to probe the dynamics of an adsorbed layer is to subject it to a sudden change in electrochemical potential . 
 dynamic simulations of such potential - step experiments are started by equilibrating the room - temperature system at a potential @xmath134 , using the simulation technique described in sec . 
 3 . then , at time @xmath135 , the potential is instantaneously stepped to a new value @xmath136 , and the simulation continues by the dynamic mc algorithm described in sec .  [ sec : dynmc ] . to study the dynamics of the phase ordering and disordering processes , we examined four different potential steps : two from the disordered phase into the ordered phase , and two from the ordered phase into the disordered phase .    before discussing each of these potential steps in detail , we give the initial adsorption , desorption , and diffusion rates at @xmath136 , immediately after the sudden potential change . 
 we define the probability during one mcss of accepting ( when possible ) an adsorption move as @xmath137 , a desorption move as @xmath138 , a nearest - neighbor diffusion move as @xmath139 , and a next - nearest neighbor diffusion move as @xmath140 . as an example , we present the rate calculations for a deep disorder - to - order step with @xmath141  mev and @xmath142  mev . each of the four rates is calculated from eq . 
 ( [ eq : dynrate ] ) . 
 the initial and final energies , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , are calculated from eq . 
 ( [ eq : hamil ] ) . at @xmath134 , @xmath143 ; therefore , at early times the surface is nearly empty . for adsorption , 
 @xmath111 is approximated as having @xmath144 , and @xmath112 contains only one occupied site . 
 thus , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147}=\nu \exp{[0.0]}$ ] . for desorption , @xmath111 must contain at least one occupied site for the process to be possible ; therefore , @xmath111 is approximated as having only one occupied site , and @xmath112 is approximated as an empty surface . 
 thus , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150}=\nu \exp{[-24.0]}$ ] . for nearest - neighbor diffusion , @xmath111 is also approximated as having only one occupied site , and @xmath112 is one of the four possible configurations which would occur from a nearest - neighbor diffusion move . 
 thus , @xmath151 , and @xmath152}=4 \nu \exp{[-4.0]}$ ] , where the factor of 4 comes from adding the contributions from each of the four final states . 
 similarly , for next - nearest neighbor diffusion , @xmath151 , and @xmath153}=4 \nu \exp{[-8.0]}$ ] . 
 the initial rates for all four potential steps are summarized in table 1 . 
 note that the rates change significantly during the course of the time evolution following each step . 
 we now discuss each of the four potential steps . 
 first we consider a disorder - to - order step with @xmath141  mev and @xmath142  mev . at @xmath134 , @xmath143 , and 
 the final potential @xmath136 is deep into the ordered phase , approximately @xmath154  mev on the positive side of the transition at @xmath155  mev . 
 figure  [ fig : posstep](a ) shows time series for both @xmath156 and @xmath70 . for deep steps like these , the desorption rate is negligible ( see table  1 ) . 
 thus , the adsorption dynamics are essentially described by the process of random sequential adsorption with diffusion ( rsad ) @xcite . 
 the coverage quickly reaches the jamming coverage for random sequential adsorption of hard squares without diffusion , @xmath157 @xcite in the hard - square model , 0.36413(1 ) and 0.3641330(5 ) , have been obtained by mc simulations @xcite and series expansions @xcite , respectively . ] . 
 this is only slightly less than the critical coverage , @xmath158 , which is reached in approximately 37  mcss . during this time , 
 small , uncorrelated domains of the ordered phase are formed on both sublattices . as the lattice fills up , 
 the interfaces between these domains contain empty sites , but the nearest - neighbor exclusion generally prevents the adsorption of additional br ions . 
 this is followed by the growth of adsorbate domains on the two sublattices which is well described by dynamical scaling ( see below ) . at this stage 
 , the coverage can increase only where domain walls move together , opening a gap large enough to fit an additional br . in the absence of single - particle diffusion 
 , the domain walls can move only by a series of very improbable desorption / adsorption events . 
 however , nearest - neighbor diffusion allows some br ions to diffuse between adjacent domains , thus providing a much faster mechanism for interface motion . for deep steps with the barriers used here , 
 interface motion is almost exclusively due to nearest - neighbor diffusion . 
 excluding very small fluctuations on short time scales , the coverage is always driven toward the equilibrium value , @xmath159 . 
 thus , the total length of interfaces is steadily decreasing . 
 finally , selection of one or the other of the two degenerate sublattices takes place at late times . the phase - selection time is expected to depend on @xmath72 .    in the dynamical scaling regime , the correlation length @xmath160 of 
 the system should grow as a power law with time @xmath161 @xcite , @xmath162 in models with non - conserved order parameter such as the one studied here , the domain growth is driven solely by the tendency to reduce the amount of interface . 
 for such systems ( known as model a in the nomenclature of critical dynamics @xcite ) @xmath163 @xcite . 
 we have used two different measures for @xmath160 . 
 one common measure uses the width of the diffuse structure - factor peak corresponding to the ordered phase , here the @xmath164 or @xmath165 peak . 
 we define the correlation length given by the structure factor as @xmath166 , where @xmath167 here @xmath168 is the circularly averaged @xmath100 and @xmath169 runs over all allowed values of @xmath170 , such that @xmath171 is less than @xmath172 to avoid picking up contributions from the small diffuse scattering surrounding the @xmath173 bragg peak . 
 figure  [ fig : s3d ] shows three - dimensional views of the structure factor and typical system configurations at three different times following this deep step into the c@xmath0 ordered phase . 
 the diagonal anisotropy in @xmath100 at late times corresponds to domain walls oriented at 45@xmath174 to the lattice directions , which are stable under diffusion . 
 figure  [ fig : save ] shows the circularly averaged structure factor at various times . at late times 
 the structure factor is proportional to @xmath175 . 
 this asymptotic behavior , known as porod s law @xcite , indicates that the domain walls are microscopically thin .    for this system 
 , we are also able to exploit the area covered by the empty domain walls as a second measure of @xmath160 @xcite , since a decrease in interfacial length is equivalent to an increase in the correlation length @xcite . 
 we define this second measure as @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the equilibrium value of the coverage at @xmath136 ( here , @xmath178 ) . 
 the inset in fig . 
 [ fig : posstep](a ) shows @xmath179 and @xmath180 as functions of @xmath181 for @xmath182 . 
 the agreement with the expected @xmath181 behavior is excellent . 
 this behavior has also been found in previous studies of rsad @xcite . for an infinite system 
 , @xmath160 would continue to grow without bound ; however , when @xmath160 reaches the same order of magnitude as @xmath72 , the system enters the phase - selection regime in which one of the two degenerate ordered phases is randomly selected .    for the other disorder - to - order step simulation , 
 we take @xmath141  mev and @xmath183  mev . 
 this step ends approximately @xmath184  mev on the positive side of the transition . figure  [ fig : posstep](b ) shows the dynamic behavior following this shallow step into the ordered phase . as one would expect , the overall response is much slower than for the deep step . 
 although the behavior at early times is more complicated than for the deep step , @xmath179 does show @xmath181 domain growth at late times ( see inset ) . 
 the length scale evaluated from the coverage , @xmath180 , is not an accurate measure for shallow steps in the time range we have simulated , since the interfaces are not as clearly defined as in the deep step . 
 as expected , the ordering dynamics are well described by the dynamical scaling prediction of model a. although dynamical scaling has yet to be experimentally measured in this system , it has been measured in other electrochemical adsorption systems @xcite , and we believe that @xmath181 dynamical scaling will be experimentally observed in the future for this system as well . 
 potential steps that induce disordering are also of interest . 
 for deep negative steps , @xmath134=@xmath185  mev and @xmath136=@xmath186  mev , the disordering process is relatively uneventful , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : negstep](a ) . particles simply desorb at a roughly constant rate , leading to an essentially exponential relaxation to equilibrium . 
 much more interesting behavior is seen after a shallow negative step , such as @xmath134=@xmath185  mev and @xmath136=@xmath187  mev , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : negstep](b ) . 
 the simulation begins with all particles on sublattice @xmath32 and relaxes to the disordered phase at @xmath136 , where @xmath188 . 
 four different dynamical regimes are seen . in the first regime 
 , particles simply desorb from the surface , so that @xmath189 . in the second regime , 
 both desorption and diffusion contribute significantly to the disordering process . 
 as more sites become vacant by desorption , small domains of the @xmath33 phase are created , both by lateral diffusion from sublattice @xmath32 and by re - adsorption from the solution . as a result , 
 the diffuse scattering peak narrows . in the third regime 
 , the net desorption slows down , and diffusion and to some extent adsorption / desorption are the only significant contributions to the disordering process . here , @xmath190 is largest . in the final regime , 
 the two sublattices become approximately equally populated , yielding @xmath191 . 
 similar behavior is seen in a dynamic mean - field theory @xcite . 
 the inset in fig . 
 [ fig : negstep](b ) shows the correlation length obtained from the diffuse ( 1/2,1/2 ) scattering peak as a function of time for the step to + 100  mev . 
 this length can be interpreted as the typical distance over which the order - parameter fluctuations are correlated . 
 thus , at early times , when the br are predominantly on sublattice @xmath32 , the fluctuations onto sublattice @xmath33 are very small . 
 we believe that the temporary increase in the correlation length obtained from the diffuse scattering is caused by the system passing near the critical point of the phase transition . 
 the length scale of the fluctuations decreases again as the coverage falls below its critical value and the macroscopic order is lost . 
 for shallow disordering steps , time series for @xmath156 and @xmath56 are quite sensitive to the choice of the adsorption / desorption barrier . here 
 we discuss how this dependence can be exploited to estimate both @xmath127 and the rate constant @xmath75 from future experimental results . for simplicity 
 , we assume that our choices of diffusion barriers are realistic . neglecting this assumption 
 does not affect our qualitative conclusions since the time scale for the disordering process is dominated by @xmath192 . 
 we first discuss @xmath193 , which depends on time only through the dimensionless rescaled time @xmath194 . 
 see fig . 
 [ fig : rsqdiffbar ] . by comparing experimental measurements of @xmath195 with the rescaled simulation results , 
 the product @xmath196 can be estimated . 
 however , knowledge of @xmath195 alone is not enough to independently estimate both @xmath75 and @xmath127 . to estimate both parameters , knowledge of @xmath197 
 is also required . 
 the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath127 can be seen in fig . 
 [ fig : rsqdiffbar ] , but the dependence is more readily seen in a parametric plot of @xmath198 , which is independent of @xmath75 . such a plot is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : parametric ] . in this form , 
 the shape dependence on @xmath127 is more obvious . 
 also , the result that @xmath199 at short times is easily seen in the parametric plot . by plotting @xmath198 from experiments and simulations together , it should be possible to estimate @xmath127 , assuming that the diffusion barriers used are realistic . 
 once @xmath127 has been estimated , the product @xmath196 , known from comparing the time scales of the experimental and simulated processes , can be used to estimate @xmath75 . 
 it is our hope that experimental measurement of both @xmath195 and @xmath197 will be possible in the future for this shallow disordering process . 
 next we use the dynamic monte carlo method described in sec .  [ sec : dynmc ] to study the dynamic response of the adlayer to a continuously varying potential , as realized in a cv experiment . 
 the system displays a phase lag between the ordering and disordering processes and the time dependent @xmath200 . for these simulated cvs , @xmath200 
 is linearly ramped from @xmath134 to @xmath136 with a sweep rate @xmath201 and then ramped back to @xmath134 at the same rate . 
 a wide range of sweep rates were simulated , from 10@xmath121 to @xmath202  mev / mcss . 
 figure  [ fig : cvcov ] shows @xmath156 as a function of @xmath200 and is analogous to the familiar hysteresis plots for magnetic systems , showing the magnetization as a function of the applied magnetic field @xcite . 
 the net flux of br@xmath20 into the adlayer is proportional to the voltammetric current . 
 figure  [ fig : cv ] shows @xmath203 as a function of @xmath200 for the three slowest sweep rates from fig . 
 [ fig : cvcov ] , along with the quasi - equilibrium cv from fig . 
 [ fig : qcv ] . for the faster sweep rates 
 , we used @xmath182 , while for the slowest sweep rates , @xmath44 was used so that simulations could be performed in a reasonable amount of time ( about 30 days of cpu time per cycle for @xmath204  mev / mcss on a pentium iii 500 mhz processor ) . to reduce the effects of statistical noise , 
 the derivatives were calculated by the savitzky - golay smoothing method using a quadratic fit to the @xmath195 data over a @xmath200 range of about 60  mev @xcite . 
 this accounts for the reduced peak height for @xmath205 , compared to fig . 
 [ fig : qcv ] .    as expected , the cvs approach the quasi - equilibrium result as @xmath201 approaches zero , and the phase lag between the response and the potential depends on the sweep rate . for non - zero sweep rates 
 , there is asymmetry between the positive - going ( ordering ) and negative - going ( disordering ) scans caused by the differences between the phase - ordering and disordering processes discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : step ] . 
 we denote the position of the sharp peak in @xmath206 for the positive - going scan as @xmath207 and for the negative - going scan as @xmath208 . figure . 
 [ fig : approach](a ) shows @xmath209 and @xmath210 as functions of @xmath201 . 
 the peak can be distinguished in the positive - going scans for all of the simulated sweep rates but is only visible in negative - going scans for the three slowest rates . 
 we therefore report the separation between the positive - going and negative - going peak positions , @xmath211 , for only these slowest rates , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : approach](b ) . 
 no simple behavior is seen , but by examining experimental peak separations @xcite , it is obvious that our slowest sweep rate is much faster than typical experimental sweep rates in the range of 1 - 10  mv / s . at the slowest simulated sweep rate , 
 our peak separation is about 60  mv ( in experimental electrode - potential units ) . from the shape of the curve it is tempting to suggest that by decreasing the sweep rate by another order of magnitude , we might obtain peak separations in the experimental range of about 10  mv . 
 we have studied the static and dynamic behavior of br electrosorption on the ag(100 ) single - crystal surface by monte carlo simulation . we have made comparison with equilibrium experiments to determine the strength of the lateral dipole - dipole repulsion and the electrosorption valency . 
 the simulations reproduce the experimentally observed second - order phase transition between a disordered adlayer and a doubly degenerate c@xmath0 ordered phase at room temperature . as was also found previously by koper @xcite , 
 the simulations reproduce the broad shoulder seen in experimental cyclic voltammograms . 
 we explain the shoulder by small configurational fluctuations in the disordered phase that locally resemble phases with @xmath87 , one of which is present for this model in equilibrium at very low temperatures . 
 stronger effects of this low - temperature equilibrium phase might be observed in the behavior of other halides on ag(100 ) . 
 we also studied the dynamics of phase ordering and disordering processes by stepping the potential between the disordered and ordered phases . 
 the ordering process is well described by @xmath181 dynamical scaling , consistent with growth of domains of the two degenerate c(@xmath212 ) ordered phases . for disordering , 
 no such competition between degenerate domains exists , and the process is well described by random desorption with diffusion . 
 study of such disordering processes may provide a way to estimate the adsorption / desorption barrier and obtain a relation between mc time and physical time .    in simulations of cvs for a wide range of potential sweep rates we found a pronounced asymmetry between the positive - going and negative - going scans . 
 this asymmetry is caused by the differences between the ordering and disordering kinetics . 
 no simple behavior is seen for the peak separation as a function of the sweep rate , but comparison with experiments suggests that our slowest sweep rate is considerably faster than experimental sweep rates which are in the range of 1 - 10  mv / s . 
 we leave comparison of simulated and experimental dynamics for future work when it hopefully becomes possible to experimentally study the dynamics of this system in full detail .

 in this appendix we discuss the nonlinear fitting of simulated adsorption isotherms to the experimental data from ref . 
 @xcite . 
 fixing a value of @xmath29 , we generated a room - temperature isotherm by mc simulation , in this appendix denoted by @xmath213 . 
 we compared this isotherm to three experimental coverage isotherms [ @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 at three different br@xmath20 concentrations [ @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 . for convenience , 
 we set the reference concentration @xmath22  mm , corresponding to the units used for the experimental kbr concentrations . equation ( 2 ) was inverted to obtain @xmath220 , assuming trial values of the parameters @xmath221 and @xmath23 , and the @xmath200-axis was rescaled into an @xmath25-axis for each concentration . 
 thus , we obtained three simulated approximations to the individual experimental isotherms [ @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 .    in order to obtain the `` best '' values of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath23 , and @xmath221 
 , we defined the simultaneous squared difference between the simulation at @xmath29 and the experimental isotherms , @xmath225 ^ 2\;.\ ] ] here @xmath226 is the @xmath227 experimental concentration value , @xmath228 is the @xmath229 value of the electrode potential for the @xmath227 experimental isotherm , @xmath230 is the sum over all experimental data points in an isotherm , and @xmath231 is the sum over the three experimental concentrations . 
 the @xmath232 calculation requires that the simulation and experimental isotherms be evaluated at the same @xmath25 values . 
 this was accomplished by linear interpolation of the simulation data . 
 the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath23 , and @xmath221 can , in principle , be found by minimizing @xmath232 with respect to all three parameters . 
 however , generating a simulated isotherm for a particular value of @xmath29 is too computationally intensive to allow simultaneous minimization of @xmath232 with respect to all three parameters . 
 we therefore minimized @xmath232 in two steps , which saves time and allows better control over the fitting process . 
 first , we generated a family of simulation isotherms for @xmath29 between @xmath23398 and @xmath23310  mev at intervals of 2  mev with a @xmath200 resolution of 50  mev over the electrochemical potential range @xmath233200 to @xmath234  mev . 
 for each of these simulated isotherms , we minimized @xmath232 with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath221 and denoted the minimum error obtained by @xmath235 , where @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the values of @xmath23 and @xmath221 which minimize @xmath232 for a particular value of @xmath29 . in the second step , we minimized @xmath235 with respect to @xmath29 . 
 the final parameter results are @xmath238  mev , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 . 
 these errors are estimated from the @xmath29 resolution and the differences in best - fit parameter values around @xmath55  mev . 
 the results of the fit are shown in fig .

64,"entanglement , the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics  @xcite , has appealed widespread attention and interest in different branches of physics and become the essential resource for many quantum information processes  @xcite . up to now , entanglement has been successfully prepared and manipulated in variously microscopic system theoretically and experimentally , such as atoms  @xcite , photons@xcite , ions  @xcite , and so on . 
 however , it is not yet completely clear that to what degree quantum mechanics is suitable for mesoscopic and macroscopic systems  @xcite . 
 in addition , the preparation of entanglement in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems should not be violated in principle  @xcite , but quantum phenomena such as quantum entanglement commonly does not present in the macroscopic world resulting form the environment - induced decoherence . 
 so many scientists tried their best to observe the novel phenomena of obtaining quantum entanglement at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level over the last decades . 
 fortunately , due to the theoretical investigation and the advancement of experimental techniques , obtaining and observing entanglement in mesocopic and even macroscopic systems have become possible .    with the fast - developing field of microfabrication and nanotechnology , cavity optomechanical system is being one of the most appealing and promising candidates as an ideal system for the study of fundamental quantum physics , such as macroscopic quantum phenomena , decoherence , and quantum - classical boundary  @xcite . 
 its standard model consists of a fabry - prot cavity with a fixed partially transmitting mirror and one movable perfectly reflecting mirror . 
 when the fabry - prot cavity is coherently driven by an external laser field , the movable mirror will be shifted from its equilibrium position and free to move along the cavity axis due to the radiation pressure force and its center - of - mass motion can be modelled as a mechanical harmonic oscillator . 
 since the mechanical harmonic oscillator resembles a prototype of classical systems  @xcite , cavity optomechanical system provides a unique platform for exploring the novel quantum phenomena at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level such as optomechanical entanglement . in recent years 
 , a number of schemes covering this topic have been proposed based on the cavity optomechanical system  @xcite . in 2007 , vitali _ et al . 
 _ successfully generated stationary entanglement between an optical cavity field mode and a macroscopic vibrating mirror in a standard optomechanical setup and showed that such optomechanical entanglement was robust against the environment temperature above 20 k  @xcite . 
 latter , their group also realized the tripartite and bipartite continuous variable entanglement by placing an ensemble of two - level atoms inside the fabry - prot cavity  @xcite . 
 then they realized the optomechanical entanglement between the experimentally detectable output field of an optical cavity and a vibrating cavity end - mirror  @xcite . in 2012 , joshi _ et al . 
 _ investigated the possibility of generating optomechanical entanglement between optical and mechanical modes of two spatially separated cavities theoretically in which each cavity was assumed to have one fixed and one movable mirror and the two cavities were coupled by an optical fiber  @xcite . 
 the entanglement between the different optical and mechanical modes in an array of three coupled optomechanical cavities was considered and the dynamics of such a setup showed that intracavity optomechanical entanglement generated independently in each cavity can be distributed pairwise between intercavity photons as well as phonons  @xcite . 
 subsequently , the scheme for entangling two macroscopic mechanical resonators ( movable mirrors ) by their coupling to the two - mode fields of a correlated - emission laser inside a doubly resonant cavity was proposed  @xcite , showing that the steady - state entanglement of two mirrors as well as that of two - mode fields can be obtained in the regime of strong field - mirror coupling when the input lasers are scattered at the anti - stokes sidebands . in 2014 , liao _ et al . 
 _ proposed a scheme to generate quantum entanglement between two macroscopic mechanical resonators in a two - cavity optomechanical system  @xcite . in a double - cavity system of a mechanical resonator 
 coupled to two cavity modes on both sides through radiation pressure , huan _ 
 _ investigated entanglement transfer from the intracavity photon - phonon entanglement to an intercavity photon - photon entanglement  @xcite . 
 investigated the entanglement properties in a hybrid system consisting of an optical cavity - array coupled to a mechanical resonator in 2015  @xcite . here 
 we propose a scheme for the creation of robust entanglement between a movable mirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical system . in the scheme , with the increase of the coupling strength of the coupled optomechanical system , not only 
 the entanglement is increasingly stronger but also the effective detuning is more and more broader , which are extremely significant due to the fact that the stronger entanglement and the more broader effective detuning are obtained , the more easily it is realized and observed in experiment . in the meanwhile , 
 the numerical simulation results indicate that critical temperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement can be raised from 24 k in ref . 
 @xcite and 20 k in ref . 
 @xcite to 32 k in our scheme in experimentally accessible parameter regimes . 
 moreover , we also investigate the entanglement transfer based on this coupled system . 
 our scheme can be used for the realization of quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and quantum - limited displacement measurements . 
 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 we establish the theoretical model of the coupled optomechanical system and present the equations of motion of the system . in sec . 
 we quantify the entanglement properties of the system by introducing the logarithmic negativity . in an experimentally accessible parameter regime 
 , we simulate the entanglement properties of the coupled optomechanical system numerically in sec . . 
 finally we make a conclusion to summarize our results in sec . . 
 as schematically shown in fig .  1 , the system studied here is composed of two coupled single - mode cavities and an ensemble of two - level atoms . 
 cavity 1 contains the atomic ensemble and is coherently driven by an external monochromatic laser field with strength @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 and cavity 2 with a fixed mirror and a second oscillating mirror couples to the cavity 1 with the coupling strength @xmath2 . 
 the optical field of cavity 2 is coupled to the mechanical motion of the movable mirror via radiation pressure force and mirror vibrational motion can be modelled as a mechanical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath3 and decay rate @xmath4 . 
 experimentally , such a double - cavity optomechanical model can be carried out in the systems based on fabry - prot cavities or whispering - gallery cavities  @xcite . 
 the hamiltonian for describing the coupled optomechanical system is written as  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bosonic operator eliminating a photon in the @xmath7-th cavity with resonance frequency @xmath8 . 
 the atomic ensemble is composed of @xmath9 two - level atoms with intrinsic frequency @xmath10 each described by the spin-1/2 pauli matrices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . 
 collective spin operators are defined as @xmath14 and satisfy the commutation relations @xmath15=s_z$ ] and @xmath16=\pm2s_{\pm}$ ] . 
 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the dimensionless position and momentum operators of the oscillating mirror , respectively , and satisfy @xmath19=i$ ] . 
 @xmath20 is the atom - cavity coupling constant and given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dipole moment of the atomic transition , @xmath23 is the free space permittivity , and @xmath24 is the volume of cavity 1 mode . 
 @xmath25 is the radiation pressure coupling strength , with @xmath26 the cavity length in the absence of the intracavity field and @xmath27 the effective mass of the mechanical mode  @xcite . the strong drive of amplitude @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the drive laser input power and the cavity decay rate , respectively , resulting in a large steady - state optical field in the cavity , which increases the occupation numbers in each mode and the radiation pressure coupling . 
 the induced steady - state intracavity in turn shifts the equilibrium position of the mechanical oscillator via the radiation pressure force . in eq . 
 ( [ e1 ] ) , the first three terms denote the free energy of the coupled optomechanical system , the fourth term represents the coupling between the cavity 1 and cavity 2 , the fifth term describes the coupling of atomic ensemble with cavity mode , the sixth term represents the coupling of optical mode with mechanical mode , and the last term describes the coupling of laser drive with the cavity , respectively . 
 an ensemble of two - level atoms is placed into the cavity 1 which is coherently driven by an external monochromatic laser field with strength @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 . 
 the vibrational motion of the oscillating mirror for cavity 2 can be modelled as a mechanical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath3 and decay rate @xmath4 and is shifted from the equilibrium position due to the radiation pressure force.,title=""fig:"",width=432,height=266 ]    we consider a compact scenario of such a equation , which is accessible in the low atomic excitation limit , i.e. , the average number of atoms in the excited state @xmath31 is much smaller than the number of total atoms  @xcite . in this limit 
 , the collective spin operators @xmath32 of the atomic polarization can be described in terms of the bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 via the holstein - primakoff transformation  @xcite @xmath35 where the usual bosonic commutation relation @xmath36=1 $ ] is still satisfied .    transforming the above hamiltonian into the rotating frame at the frequency @xmath1 of the driving laser field , we rewrite the system hamiltonian as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the cavity mode and atomic detuning with respect to the driving laser , @xmath40 .    a proper analysis of the dynamics of the coupled optomechanical system can be accomplished by a set of nonlinear langevin equations in which the corresponding dissipation and fluctuation terms are added to the heisenberg equations of motion derived form the eq . 
 ( [ e3 ] ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the decay rate of the atomic excited state level and the nonvanishing correlation functions of noises affecting atoms and cavity fields obey the relations @xmath43  @xcite . 
 here we have assumed that the cavity 1 and cavity 2 have the same decay rate @xmath30 . 
 furthermore , the mechanical mode is also affected by the stochastic hermitian brownian noise @xmath44 that satisfies the non - markovian correlation function with a colored spectrum in general  @xcite @xmath45d\omega,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath47 is the temperature of the mechanical oscillator . 
 however , quantum effects are revealed only for the mechanical oscillator with a high quality factor , i.e. , @xmath48 . in this limit 
 , this non - markovian process can be approximated as a markovian one and the brownian noise @xmath49 can be simplified to delta - correlated  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mean thermal excitation number . in 
 the following we discuss the entanglement of the coupled optomechanical system in the regime where the system is stable . 
 we now begin to linearize the dynamics of the coupled optomechanical system . 
 the nonlinear quantum langevin equations can be linearized by rewriting each heisenberg operator as a sum of its steady - state mean value and an additional fluctuation operator with zero - mean value , i.e. , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55  @xcite . substituting these expressions into eq . 
 ( [ e4 ] ) and the latter will be separated into a set of nonlinear algebra equations for the steady - state value and a set of quantum langevin equations for the fluctuation operators  @xcite . 
 the steady - state mean values of the coupled optomechanical system can be obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero , @xmath56,\cr\cr c_s&=&-ig_aa_{1s}/(\gamma_a+i\delta_a),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the effective detuning of the second cavity mode . 
 we assume that the cavity is intensively driven with a very large input power @xmath29 , so that at the steady state , the intracavity fields have a large amplitude @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 . in the strong driving limit 
 , we can safely omit the nonlinear quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 and get the following linearized langevin equations , @xmath62 where we have chosen the phase reference of the cavity fields so that @xmath58 can be taken real . here 
 we will devote to establishing the presence of quantum correlations among the subsystems of the coupled optomechanical system at the steady state , which can be carried out by analyzing the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations of the coupled optomechanical system around the steady state . generally , it is convenient to use the pairwise quadrature operators defined by @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 and the corresponding hermitian input noise operators @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 then the resulting evolution equations of motion for the fluctuations in eq . 
 ( [ e8 ] ) can be rewritten in a compact form as follows , @xmath69 where the vector of eight - component quadrature fluctuations @xmath70 , similarly the input - noise vector @xmath71 , and the drift matrix @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the effective optomechanical coupling . 
 now the quantum fluctuations of the field and the oscillating mirror are coupled by the much larger effective optomechanical coupling @xmath75 , so the engineering of significant optomechanical entanglement in coupled system becomes possible  @xcite . 
 the formal solution of the first - order linear inhomogeneous differential equation  ( [ e15 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath76 where the matrix @xmath77 and the initial condition @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is the identity matrix ) . in the present coupled system , 
 appealing quantities are the quadrature fluctuations . 
 thus we define a covariance matrix @xmath80 by the element @xmath81 for @xmath82 . 
 the coupled system is stable and reaches its steady state only if the real part of all the eigenvalues of the drift matrix @xmath72 are negative so that @xmath83 . 
 the stability conditions can be derived by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion  @xcite and the case of eight dimensions matrix is shown in ref . 
 we will guarantee the stability conditions of the system in the following analysis . when the coupled system reaches its steady state ( @xmath84 ) 
 , one can obtain @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the stationary noise correlation matrix . due to the fact that the seven components of @xmath87 are uncorrelated , we can get @xmath88 , where @xmath89 $ ] is the diagonal matrix for the corresponding damping and leakage rates stemming from the noise correlations . hence eq . 
 ( [ e18 ] ) becomes @xmath90 . 
 when the stability conditions of the coupled system are satisfied , the steady - state correlation matrix can be derived from the following lyapunov equation  @xcite @xmath91 from this equation , the covariance matrix @xmath92 can be written as the form of a block matrix @xmath93 where each block represents @xmath94 matrix . 
 the blocks on the diagonal indicate the variance within each subsystem ( the oscillating mirror , the cavity mode 1 , the cavity mode 2 , and the atomic ensemble ) , while the off - diagonal blocks indicate covariance across different subsystems , i.e. , the correlations between two components of the whole coupled optomechanical system . 
 to compute the entanglement among the subsystems of the coupled optomechanical system , we reduce the @xmath95 covariance matrix * v * to a @xmath96 submatrix @xmath97 . 
 if the indices @xmath98 and @xmath7 for the element @xmath99 are confined to the set @xmath100 , the submatrix @xmath101 $ ] is formed by the first four rows and columns of @xmath92 and corresponds to the covariance between the cavity 1 mode and the oscillating mirror . 
 similarly , if the indices run over @xmath102 , @xmath97 is the covariance matrix of the cavity mode 2 and the oscillating mirror . 
 if the indices run over @xmath103 , @xmath97 labels the covariance between the atomic ensemble and the oscillating mirror . summarizing , the submatrix can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath27 and @xmath105 index the subsystem \{oscillating mirror , cavity 1 ( cavity 2 , atomic ensemble ) } in the coupled optomechanical system . 
 next we resort to simon s criterion to judge continuous variable entanglement  @xcite . 
 for a physical state , the covariance matrix @xmath92 must obey the robertson - schrdinger uncertainty principle @xmath106 where @xmath107 with @xmath108 . 
 here we define the vector @xmath109 for a two - mode system 
 . if a state is separable , partial transpose matrix @xmath110 ( obtained from @xmath92 just by taking @xmath111 in @xmath112 ) still comply with the eq . 
 ( [ e22 ] ) . 
 this inequality equation requires that all the symplectic eigenvalues of the transposed matrix to be larger than 1/2 . 
 so if the smallest eigenvalues is less than 1/2 , the transposed modes are inseparable , i.e. , there exists entanglement between the modes . 
 we introduce the logarithmic negativity to quantify the entanglement which can be computed by means of a process known as symplectic diagonalization of submatrix @xmath97 , where the entanglement properties are characterized in the symplectic eigenvalues of the diagonalized matrix . 
 if the diagonalized matrix is written as @xmath113 $ ] , then the eigenvalues along the diagonal is  @xcite @xmath114},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath115 . 
 we regard @xmath116 as the minimum sysplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and the logarithmic negativity @xmath117 can be defined as @xmath118 $ ]  @xcite . 
 therefore , the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath116 completely quantifies the quantum entanglement among the subsystems and they are entangled if and only if @xmath119 , which is consistent with the simon s criterion . in the next section , 
 we utilize the logarithmic negativity @xmath117 to show the entanglement properties of the coupled optomechanical system numerically . 
 [ 1 ]    .the experimental parameters for the coupled optomechanical system used in our numerical simulation , extracted from the experiments in refs .  @xcite . [ cols=""^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     in the following , we investigate the stationary optomechanical entanglement among the subsystems numerically . in fact , eq .  ( [ e19 ] ) is a linear equation for * v * and can be straightforwardly solved , but the general exact expression is too tedious . 
 however , it is easy to simulate numerically . in our numerical calculations , 
 we adopt the set of experimental parameters for the coupled optomechanical system given in table , which can be carried out in current experiments  @xcite , consequently , our scheme is experimentally feasible . in order to produce continuous variable entanglement in coupled optomechanical system , we must construct the effective hamiltonian of the nondegenerate parametric - down conversion type for the system through setting @xmath120  @xcite . 
 [ fig2 ]   as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath121 with four different optical coupling strength @xmath2 at a fixed temperature @xmath47=400 mk and the other parameters are given in table .,title=""fig : "" ]    firstly , we investigate the entanglement of two indirectly coupled macroscopic objects . in the experimentally accessible parameter regimes , 
 our scheme realizes the robust entanglement between the movable mirror and atomic ensemble ( @xmath122  @xcite ) in the coupled optomechanical system , which is incredible in the macroscopic world . 
 2 shows the logarithmic negativity @xmath117 between the movable mirror and atomic ensemble versus the normalized detuning @xmath121 for different coupling strengths . 
 it can be clearly seen from fig . 
 2 that not only the entanglement is increasingly stronger but also the effective detuning is more and more broader with the increase of the coupling strength , which are extremely significant due to the fact that the stronger entanglement and the more broader effective detuning are obtained , the more easily it is realized and observed in experiment . furthermore , the mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement is present only within a finite interval of values of @xmath123 around @xmath124 , which is in accordance with ref . 
 @xcite . 
 [ fig3 ]   versus the mirror s temperature @xmath47 with three different optical coupling strength @xmath2 . here 
 @xmath125 and the other parameters are given in table .,title=""fig : "" ]    the robustness of such a mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement with respect to the environmental temperature @xmath47 of oscillating mirror is shown in fig . 
 3 . as clearly presented in fig .  3 , due to the environment - induced decoherence , the intensity of the mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement decreases and eventually vanishes with the rise of environmental temperature . with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 , the critical value of temperature @xmath126 ( @xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) increases . when the coupling strength is set @xmath129 , 
 the critical value of temperature @xmath126 of the mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement persists for 32 k , which is several orders of magnitude larger than the ground state temperature of the mechanical oscillator and is higher than that in refs . 
 therefore , it is easier and more feasible to be realized and observed from the experimental point view . 
 [ fig4 ]    secondly , we investigate the stationary entanglement of the three possible bipartite subsystems in terms of the logarithmic negativity @xmath117 . 
 we denote the logarithmic negativities for the cavity 1-mirror , cavity 2-mirror , and atomic ensemble - mirror as @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , respectively . 
 the bipartite entanglements between the cavity 1-cavity 2 , cavity 1-atomic ensemble , and cavity 2-atomic ensemble are so weak that there is no need to consider them . 
 the results on the behavior of the bipartite entanglement are shown in fig .  4 in which we plot three bipartite logarithmic negativities @xmath130(black curves ) , @xmath131(red curves ) , and @xmath132(blue curves ) versus the normalized dutuning @xmath121 at a fixed temperature of @xmath47=400 mk for four different coupling strengths . 
 it is evident that there is a sort of entanglement transfer among the three bipartite subsystems , i.e. , the bipartite entanglements @xmath130 and @xmath132 increase while the bipartite entanglement @xmath131 decreases with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 . 
 in other words , the enhancement of the entanglements between cavity 1 and mirror and atomic ensemble and mirror at the expense of the entanglement between cavity 2 and mirror . 
 it is remarkable that , therefore , the indirectly coupled entanglement ( @xmath130 and @xmath132 ) transfers with the directly coupled entanglement ( @xmath131 ) each other with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 . 
 it is worth noting that in the above discussion the effect of the entanglement transfer among the three bipartite subsystems is predominant when the atoms are resonant with the stokes sideband ( @xmath133 ) . 
 moreover , we notice that atomic ensemble - mirror entanglement is not present at @xmath134 , which is due to the fact that the entanglement is mostly carried by the cavity 1-mirror and cavity 2-mirror .    in above discussion , we assume that the average number of atoms in the excited state is much smaller than the number of total atoms . here 
 we discuss the limits of validity of the model . 
 the bosonic description of the atomic polarization is valid only when the single - atom excitation probability , @xmath135 , is much smaller than 1  @xcite . 
 furthermore , the linearization of the quantum langevin equations is valid when the intracavity fields have a large amplitude at the steady state , i.e. , @xmath59 . 
 therefore , the above two conditions are simultaneously satisfied only when @xmath136 . 
 this means requiring a very weak atom - cavity coupling . 
 but if we consider a relatively small cavity mode volume ( @xmath137 @xmath138 ) , in this case , @xmath20 is not very weak when we consider a standard optical dipole transition . 
 however , the required weak - coupling condition can still be achieved  @xcite . 
 we now address the experimental issues . 
 the detection of the generated entanglement at the macroscopic level in optomechanical systems is still an experimental challenge . 
 however , for the detection of the entanglement , we have to measure the quadrature correlations  @xcite and quantum correlation detection is relatively easy in optomechanical systems . 
 recently , several promising programs have been proposed in refs . 
 @xcite , so we can exploit homodyne measurement experimental techniques to detect quantum correlations so as to detect the indirectly coupled quantum entanglement . 
 in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme to create robust entanglement between a movable mirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical system . with the increase of the coupling strength of the coupled optomechanical system , the stronger entanglement and the broader effective detuning 
 can be obtained , so it is easier and more feasible to realize and observe this sort of novel phenomena in experiment . 
 utilizing experimentally accessible parameters , the critical temperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement in our scheme can approach to 32 k , much higher than that in refs . 
 we also investigated the entanglement transfer based on this coupled system . 
 such a scheme can be used for the realization of quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and quantum - limited displacement measurements .

65,"understanding the nature of quantum correlations in multiparty systems and the distinguishing features they exhibit relative to classical correlations is a central goal across quantum information processing ( qip ) science @xcite , with implications ranging from condensed - matter and statistical physics to quantum chemistry , and the quantum - to - classical transition . from a foundational perspective , exploring what different kinds of correlations are , in principle , allowed by probabilistic theories more general than quantum mechanics further helps to identify under which set of physical constraints the standard quantum framework may be uniquely recovered @xcite .    in this context , entanglement provides a distinctively quantum type of correlation , that has no analogue in classical statistical mechanics . 
 a striking feature of entanglement is that it can not be freely distributed among different parties : if a bipartite system , say , @xmath4(lice ) and @xmath5(ob ) , is in a maximally entangled pure state , then no other system , @xmath6(harlie ) , may be correlated with it . in other words , 
 the entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is _ monogamous _ and can not be _ shared _ 
 this simple tripartite setting motivates two simple questions about bipartite quantum states : given a bipartite state , we ask whether it can arise as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath5 and of @xmath4-@xmath6 simultaneously ; or , more generally , given two bipartite states , we ask if one can arise as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath5 while the other arises as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath6 . 
 it should be emphasized that both of these are questions about the existence of tripartite states with given reduction properties . 
 while formal ( and more general ) definitions will be provided later in the paper , these examples serve to introduce the notions of _ sharing _ ( 1 - 2 sharing ) and _ joining _ ( 1 - 2 joining ) , respectively . in its most general formulation , the joinability problem is also known as the _ quantum marginal problem _ ( or _ local consistency problem _ ) , which has been heavily investigated both from a mathematical - physics @xcite and a quantum - chemistry perspective @xcite and is known to be qma - hard @xcite . 
 our choice of terminology , however , facilitates a uniform language for describing the joinability / sharability scenarios . 
 for instance , we say that the joinable correlations of @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 are joined by a joining state on @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 . 
 the limited sharability / joinability of entanglement was first quantified in the seminal work by coffman , kundu , and wootters , in terms of an exact ( ckw ) inequality obeyed by the entanglement across the @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xmath4-@xmath6 and @xmath4-@xmath7 bipartitions , as measured by concurrence @xcite . in a similar venue 
 , several subsequent investigations attempted to determine how different entanglement measures can be used to diagnose failures of joinability , see e.g. @xcite . 
 more recently , significant progress has been made in characterizing quantum correlations more general than entanglement @xcite , in particular as captured by quantum discord @xcite . 
 while it is now established that quantum discord does not obey a monogamy inequality @xcite , different kind of limitations exist on the extent to which it can be freely shared and/or communicated @xcite . despite these important advances , 
 a complete picture is far from being reached . 
 what kind of limitations do strictly mark the quantum - classical correlation boundary ? 
 what different quantum features are responsible for enforcing different aspects of such limitations , and how does this relate to the degree of resourcefulness that these correlations can have for qip ?    while the above are some of the broad questions motivating this work , our specific focus here is to make progress on joinability and sharability properties in low - dimensional multipartite settings . in this context , a recent paper @xcite has obtained a necessary condition for three - party joining in finite dimension in terms of the subsystem entropies , and additionally established a sufficient condition in terms of the trace - norm distances between the states in question and known joinable states . for the specific case of qubit 
 werner states @xcite , werner himself established necessary and sufficient conditions for the 1 - 2 joining scenario @xcite . with regards to sharability , 
 necessary and sufficient conditions have been found for 1 - 2 sharing of generic bipartite qubit states @xcite , as well as for specific classes of qudit states @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , 
 no conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for the joinability of generic states are available as yet . in this paper 
 , we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for both the _ three - party joinability and the 1-@xmath3 sharability _ problems , in the case that the reduced bipartite states are _ either werner or isotropic states on @xmath1-dimensional subsystems _ ( qudits ) . 
 though our results are restricted in scope of applicability , they provide key insights as to the sources of joinability limitations . 
 most importantly , we find that standard measures of quantum correlations , such as concurrence and quantum discord , do not suffice to determine the limitations in joining quantum correlations . specifically , we find that the joined states need _ not _ be entangled or even discordant in order not to be joinable . 
 further to that , although separable states may have joinability limitations , they _ are _ , nonetheless , freely ( arbitrarily ) sharable . by introducing a one - parameter class of probability distributions , 
 we provide a natural classical analogue to qudit werner and isotropic quantum states . 
 this allows us to illustrate how classical joinability restrictions carry over to the quantum case and , more interestingly , to demonstrate that the quantum case demands limitations which are not present classically . 
 ultimately , this feature may be traced back to _ 
 complementarity of observables _ , which clearly plays no role in the classical case . 
 it is suggestive to note that the uncertainty principle was also shown to be instrumental in constraining the sharability of quantum discord @xcite . 
 it is our hope that further pursuits of more general necessary and sufficient conditions may be aided by the methods and findings herein . 
 the content is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : basics ] we present the relevant mathematical framework for defining the joinability and sharability notions and the extension problems of interest , along with some preliminary results contrasting the classical and quantum cases . 
 [ sec : wernerstates ] contains the core results of our analysis . 
 in particular , after reviewing the defining properties of werner and isotropic states on qudits , in sec . [ sec : states ] we motivate the appropriate choice of probability distributions that serve as a classical analogue , and determine the resulting classical joinability limitations in sec . [ 
 sec : classicaljoining ] . 
 necessary and sufficient conditions for three - party joinability of quantum werner and isotropic states are established in sec . 
 [ subsec : wjoin ] , and contrasted to the classical scenario . 
 [ subsec : cloning ] shows how the results on isotropic state joinability are in fact related to known results on quantum cloning , whereas in sec . 
 [ subsec : wsharability ] we establish simple analytic expressions for the 1-@xmath3 sharability of both werner and isotropic states , along with discussing constructive procedures to determine @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability properties for @xmath8 . in sec . 
 [ sec : furtherremarks ] , we present additional remarks on joinability and sharability scenarios beyond those of sec . 
 [ sec : wernerstates ] . 
 in particular , we outline generalizations of our analysis to @xmath0-party joinability , and show how bounds on the sharability of _ arbitrary bipartite states _ follow from the werner and isotropic results . 
 concluding remarks and open questions are presented in sec . 
 [ sec : end ] . for ease and clarity of presentation , the technical proofs of the results in sec . 
 [ sec : wernerstates ] are presented in two separate appendixes ( [ sec : joiningreptools ] on joinability and [ sec : sharingreptools ] on sharability , respectively ) , together with the relevant group - representation tools . 
 although our main focus will be to quantitatively characterize simple low - dimensional settings , we introduce the relevant concepts with a higher degree of generality , in order to better highlight the underlying mathematical structure and to ease connections with existing related notions in the literature . 
 we are interested in the correlations among the subsystems of a @xmath0-partite composite system @xmath9 . in the quantum case , 
 we thus require a hilbert space with a tensor product structure : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the individual `` single - particle '' state spaces and , for our purposes , each @xmath12 is finite . in the classical scenario , to each subsystem we associate a sample space @xmath13 consisting of @xmath12 possible outcomes , with the joint sample space being given by the cartesian product : @xmath14 probability distributions on @xmath15 are the classical counterpart of quantum density operators on @xmath16 . 
 the input to a joinability problem is a set of subsystem states which , in full generality , may be specified relative to a `` neighboorhood structure '' on @xmath16 ( or @xmath15 ) @xcite . 
 that is , let neighborhoods @xmath17 be given as subsets of the set of indexes labeling individual subsystems , @xmath18 
 . we can then give the following :    * [ quantum joinability ] * given a neighborhood structure @xmath19 on @xmath16 , a list of density operators @xmath20 is _ joinable _ if there exists an @xmath0-partite density operator @xmath21 , called a _ joining state _ 
 , that reduces according to the neighborhood structure , that is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the tensor complement of @xmath24 . 
 the analagous definition for classical joinability is obtained by substituting corresponding terms , in particular , by replacing the partial trace over @xmath25 with the corresponding marginal probability distribution . 
 as remarked , the question of joinability has been extensively investigated in the context of the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite marginal problem . 
 a joining state is equivalenty referred to as an _ extension _ or an element of the _ pre - image _ of the list under the reduction map , while the members of a list of joinable states are also said to be _ compatible _ or _ 
 consistent_.    clearly , a _ 
 condition for a list of states to be joinable is that they `` agree '' on any overlapping reduced states . 
 that is , given any two states from the list whose neighborhoods are intersecting , the reduced states of the subsystems in the intersection must coincide . from this point of view , any failure of joinability due to a disagreement of overlappping reduced states is a trivial case of non - compatible @xmath0-party correlations . 
 we are interested in cases where joinability fails _ despite _ the agreement on overlapping marginals . 
 this consistency requirement will be satisfied by construction for the werner and isotropic quantum states we shall consider in sec . 
 [ sec : wernerstates ] . 
 one important feature of joinability , which has recently been investigated in @xcite , is the _ convex structure _ that both joinable states lists and joining states enjoy . 
 the set of lists of density operators satisfying a given joinability scenario is convex under component - wise combination ; this is because the same convex combination of their joining states is a valid joining state for the convex combined list of states . 
 similarly , the set of joining states for a given list of joined states is convex by the linearity of the partial trace . 
 as mentioned , one of our goals is to shed light on limitations of quantum vs. classical joinability and the extent to which entanglement may play a role in that respect . 
 that quantum states are subject to stricter joinability limitations than classical probability distributions do , can be immediately appreciated by considering two density operators @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is any maximally entangled bell pair on two qubits : no three - qubit joining state @xmath28 exists , despite the reduced state on @xmath4 being manifestly consistent . 
 in contrast , as shown in @xcite , as long as two classical distributions have equal marginal distributions over @xmath4 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can always be joined . 
 this is evidenced by the construction of the joining state : @xmath31 . as pointed out in @xcite , 
 although the above choice is not unique , it is the joining state with maximal entropy and represents an even mixture of all valid joining distributions . 
 although any _ two _ consistently - overlapped classical probability distributions may be joined , limitations on joining classical probability distributions _ do _ typically arise in more general joining scenarios . 
 this follows from the fact that any classical probability assignments must be consistent with some convex combination of pure states . 
 consider , for example , a pairwise neighboorhood structure , with an associated list of states @xmath29 , @xmath32 , and @xmath30 , which have consistent single - subsystem marginals . 
 clearly , if each subsystem corresponds to a bit , no convex combination of pure states gives rise to a probability distribution @xmath33 in which each pair is completely anticorrelated ; in other words , `` bits of three ca nt all disagree '' . in sec . 
 [ subsec : wjoin ] , we explicitly compare this particular classical joining scenario to analogous quantum scenarios . 
 while all the classical joining limitations may be expressed by linear inequalities , the quantum joining limitations are significantly more complicated . 
 the limitations arise from demanding that the joining operator be a valid density operator , namely , trace - one and _ non - negative _ ( which clearly implies hermiticity ) . 
 this fact is demonstrated by the following proposition , which may be readily generalized to any joining scenario :    for any two trace - one hermitian operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 which obey the consistency condition @xmath36 , there exists a trace - one hermitian joining operator @xmath37 . 
 consider an orthogonal hermitian product basis which includes the identity for each subsystem , that is , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 . 
 then we can construct the space of all valid joining operators @xmath37 as follows . 
 let @xmath40 be the dimension of the composite system . 
 the component along @xmath41 is fixed as @xmath42 , satisfying the trace - one requirement . 
 the components along the two - body operators of the form @xmath43 are fixed by the required reduction to @xmath34 , and similarly the components along the two - body operators of the form @xmath44 are determined by @xmath35 . 
 the components along the one - body operators of the form @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are determined from the reductions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . 
 this leaves the coefficients of all remaining basis operators unconstrained , since their corresponding basis operators are zero after a partial trace over systems @xmath5 or @xmath6 . 
 thus , requiring the joining operator to be hermitian and normalized is not a limiting constraint with respect to joinability : _ any limitations are due to the non - negativity constraint_. understanding how non - negativity manifests is extremely difficult in general and far beyond our scope here . 
 we can nevertheless give an example in which the role of non - negativity is clear . 
 part of the job of non - negativity is to enforce constraints that are also obeyed by classical probability distributions . 
 for example , in the case of a two - qubit state @xmath48 , if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then @xmath51 _ must _ equal @xmath52 . 
 more generally , consider a set of mutually commuting observables @xmath53 and any basis @xmath54 in which all @xmath55 are diagonal . 
 any valid state must lead to a list of expectation values @xmath56 , whose values are element - wise convex combinations of the vertexes @xmath57 . 
 the interpretation of this constraint is that since commuting observables have simultaneously definable values , just as classical observables do , probability distributions on them must obey the rules of classical probability distributions . 
 we call on this fact when we compare the quantum joining limitations to the classical analogue ones in sec . 
 [ subsec : wjoin ] . 
 non - negativity constraints that do _ not _ arise from classical limitations on compatible observables may be labeled as inherently quantum constraints , the most familiar being provided by uncertainty relations for conjugate observables @xcite . 
 although complementarity constraints are most evident for observables acting on the same system , complementarity can also give rise to a trade - off in the information about a subsystem observable vs. a joint observable . 
 this fact is essentially what allows bell s inequality to be violated . for our purposes , the complementarity that comes into play 
 is that between `` overlapping '' joint observables ( e.g. , between @xmath58 and @xmath59 for three qubits ) . 
 we are thus generally interested in understanding the interplay between purely classical and quantum joining limitations , and in the correlation trade - offs that may possibly emerge . 
 historically , as already mentioned , a pioneering exploration of the extent to which quantum correlations can be shared among three parties was carried out in @xcite , yielding a characterization of the monogamy of entanglement in terms of the well - known ckw inequality : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the concurrence and the right hand - side is minimized over all pure - state decompositions . 
 thus , with the entanglement across the bipartition @xmath4 and @xmath7 held fixed , an increase in the upper bound of the @xmath4-@xmath5 entanglement can only come at the cost of a decrease in the upper bound of the @xmath4-@xmath6 entanglement . 
 one may wonder whether the ckw inequality may help in diagnosing joinability of reduced states . 
 if a joining state @xmath28 is _ not _ a priori determined ( in fact , the existence of such a state _ is _ the entire question of joinability ) , the ckw inequality may be used to obtain a _ necessary _ condition for joinability , namely , if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are joinable , then @xmath64 however , there exist pairs of bipartite states  both unentangled ( as the following proposition shows ) and non - trivially entangled ( as we shall determine in sec . 
 iii.b , see in particular fig . [ 
 fig : wernerpairjoinability ] )  that obey the `` weak '' ckw inequality in eq . 
 ( [ ckwweak ] ) , yet are _ not _ joinable . 
 the key point is that while the limitations that the ckw captures are to be ascribed to entanglement , entanglement is not required to prevent two states from being joinable . 
 in fact , weaker forms of quantum correlations , as quantified by quantum discord @xcite , are likewise _ not _ required for joinability limitations . 
 consider , specifically , so - called `` classical - quantum '' bipartite states , of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is some local orthogonal basis on @xmath4 and @xmath67 is , for each @xmath68 , an arbitrary state on @xmath5 . 
 such states are known to have zero discord @xcite . yet 
 , the following holds :    classical - quantum correlated states need not be joinable . 
 consider the two quantum states @xmath69 on the pairs @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 , respectively . both have a 
 completely mixed reduced state over @xmath4 and thus it is meaningful to consider their joinability . 
 let @xmath28 be a joining state . 
 then the outcome of bob s @xmath70 measurement would correctly lead him to predict alice to be in the state @xmath71 or @xmath72 , while at the same time the outcome of charlie s @xmath73 measurement would correctly lead him to predict alice to be in the state @xmath74 or @xmath75 . 
 since this violates the uncertainty principle , @xmath28 can not be a valid joining state . 
 the existence of separable not joinable states has been independently reported in @xcite . while formally our example is subsumed under the more general one presented in thm . 
 4.2 therein ( strictly satisfying the necessary condition for joinability given by their eq . 
 ( 2.2 ) ) , it has the advantage of offering both a transparent physical interpretation of the underlying correlation properties , and an intuitive proof of the joinability failure . 
 as mentioned , the second joinability structure we analyze is motivated by the concept of sharability . in our context 
 , we can think of sharability as a restricted joining scenario in which a bipartite state is joined with copies of itself . 
 if @xmath76 , consider a @xmath0-partite space that consists of @xmath2 `` right '' copies of @xmath77 and @xmath3 `` left '' copies of @xmath78 , with each neighborhood consisting of one right and one left subsystem , respectively ( hence a total of @xmath79 neighborhoods ) . 
 we then have the following :    * [ quantum sharability ] * a bipartite density operator @xmath80 is @xmath2-@xmath3 _ sharable _ if there exists an @xmath0-partite density operator @xmath81 , called a _ sharing state _ , that reduces left - right - pairwise to @xmath48 , that is , @xmath82 where the partial trace is taken over the tensor complement of neighborhood @xmath83 . 
 each @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability scenario may be viewed as a specific joining structure with the additional constraint that each of the joining states be equal to one another , the list being @xmath84 . in 
 what follows , we shall take _ arbitrarily sharable _ to mean @xmath85-@xmath85 sharable , whereas _ 
 finitely sharable _ means that @xmath48 is not @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable for some @xmath2 , @xmath3 . also , each property `` @xmath2-@xmath3 
 sharable '' ( sometimes also referred to as a `` @xmath2-@xmath3 extendible '' ) is taken to define a _ 
 sharability criterion _ 
 , which a state may or may not satisfy . 
 it is worth noting the relationship between sharability and _ n - representability_. the @xmath0-representability problem asks if , for a given ( symmetric ) @xmath86-partite density operator @xmath48 on @xmath87 , there exists an @xmath0-partite pre - image state for which @xmath48 is the @xmath86-particle reduced state . 
 @xmath0-representability has been extensively studied for indistinguishable bosonic and fermionic subsystems @xcite and is a very important problem in quantum chemistry @xcite . 
 we can view @xmath0-representability as a variant on the sharability problem , whereby the distinction between the left and right subsystems is lifted , and @xmath88 . 
 given the @xmath86-partite state @xmath48 as the shared state , we ask if there exists a sharing @xmath0-partite state which shares @xmath48 among all possible @xmath86-partite subsystems . in the setting of indistinguishable particles , 
 the associated symmetry further constrains the space of the valid @xmath0-partite sharing states .    just as with 1 - 2 joinability , 
 any classical probability distribution is arbitrarily sharable @xcite . likewise , 
 similar to the joinability case , convexity properties play an important role towards characterizing sharability . 
 if @xmath89 and @xmath90 , then it follows from the convexity of the set of joinable states lists that @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable states form a convex set , for fixed subsystem dimensions @xmath91 and @xmath92 . 
 this implies that if @xmath48 satisfies a particular sharability criterion , then any mixture of @xmath48 with the completely mixed state also satisfies that criterion , since the completely mixed state is arbitrarily ( @xmath85-@xmath85 ) sharable . 
 besides mixing with the identity , the degree of sharability may be unchanged under more general transformations on the input state . 
 consider , specifically , completely - positive trace - preserving bipartite maps @xmath93 that can be written as a mixture of local unitary operations , that is , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are arbitrary unitary transformations @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . these ( unital ) maps 
 form a proper subset of general local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . 
 we establish the following :    if @xmath48 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable , then @xmath93 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable for any map @xmath99 that is a convex mixture of unitaries . 
 [ thm : locc ]    let @xmath93 be expressed as in eq . 
 ( [ map ] ) . by virtue of the convexity of the set of @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable states ( for fixed subsystem dimensions ) 
 , it suffices to show that each term , @xmath100 , in @xmath93 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable . 
 let @xmath101 be a sharing state for @xmath48 , and define @xmath102 then , for any left - right pair of subsystems @xmath68 and @xmath103 , it follows that @xmath104 hence , @xmath105 is an @xmath2-@xmath3-sharing state for @xmath106 , as desired . 
 this result suggests a connection between the degree of sharability and the entanglement of a given state . in both cases , 
 there exist classes of states for which these properties can not be `` further degraded '' by locally acting maps ( or any map for that matter ) . obviously , locc can not decrease the entanglement of states with no entanglement , and convex unitary mixtures as above can not increase the sharability of states with @xmath85-@xmath85 sharability ( because they are already as sharable as possible ) . 
 these two classes of states can in fact be shown to coincide as a consequence of the fact that _ arbitrary sharability is equivalent to ( bipartite ) separability_. this result has been appreciated in the literature @xcite and is credited to both @xcite and @xcite . 
 we reproduce it here in view of its relevance to our work :    a bipartite quantum state @xmath48 on @xmath107 is unentangled ( or separable ) if and only if it is arbitrarily sharable . 
 ( @xmath108 ) let @xmath48 be separable . 
 then for some set of density operators @xmath109 , it can be written as @xmath110 with @xmath111 . 
 let @xmath3 and @xmath2 be arbitrary , and let the @xmath0-partite state @xmath101 , be defined as follows : @xmath112 with @xmath113 . by construction , the state of each @xmath114-@xmath115 pair is @xmath48 , since it follows straighforwardly that eq . 
 ( [ qs ] ) is obeyed for each @xmath116 . 
 thus , @xmath101 is a valid sharing state . 
 ( @xmath117 ) since @xmath48 is arbitrarily sharable , there exists a sharing state @xmath101 for arbitrary values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 . 
 in particular , we need only make use of a sharing state @xmath101 for @xmath118 and arbitrarily large @xmath3 , whence we let @xmath119 . given @xmath101 , let us construct another sharing state @xmath120 , which is invariant under permutations of the right subsystems , that is , let @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the permutation group of @xmath3 objects , acting on @xmath123 via the natural @xmath3-fold representation , @xmath124 , @xmath125 . 
 it then follows that @xmath120 shares @xmath48 : @xmath126 having established the existence of a symmetric sharing state @xmath127 , fannes theorem ( see section 2 of @xcite ) implies the existence of a unique representation of @xmath120 as a sum of product states , @xmath128 reducing @xmath120 to any @xmath114-@xmath115 pair leaves a separable state . 
 thus , if @xmath48 is 1-@xmath3 sharable it must be separable . 
 as we alluded to before , a corollary of this result is that in fact _ 
 1-@xmath85 sharability implies _ 
 @xmath85-@xmath85 sharability . in closing this section 
 , we also briefly mention the concept of _ exchangeability _ @xcite . a density operator @xmath48 on @xmath129 is said to be exchangeable if it is symmetric under permutation of its @xmath86 subsystems and if there exists a symmetric state @xmath101 on @xmath130 such that the reduced states of any subset of @xmath86 subsystems is @xmath48 for all @xmath131 . similar to sharability , exchangeability implies separability . 
 however , _ the converse only holds in general for sharability _ : clearly , there exist states which are separable but not exchangeable , because of the extra symmetry requirement . 
 thus , the notion of sharability is more directly related to entanglement than exchangeability is . 
 even for the simplest case of two bipartite states with an overlapping marginal , a general characterization of joinability is extremely non - trivial . 
 as remarked , no conditions yet exist which are both necessary and sufficient for two _ arbitrary _ density operators to be joinable ; although , conditions that are separately necessary or sufficient have been recently derived @xcite . in this section , we present a complete characterization of the three - party joining scenario and the 1-@xmath3 sharability problem for werner and isotropic states on arbitrary subsystem dimension @xmath1 . 
 we begin by introducing the relevant families of quantum and classical states to be considered . 
 the usefulness of bipartite werner and isotropic states is derived from their simple analytic properties and range of mixed state entanglement . for a given subsystem dimension @xmath1 , 
 werner states are defined as the one - parameter family that is invariant under collective unitary transformations @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , that is , transformations of the form @xmath132 , for arbitrary @xmath133 . 
 the parameterization which we employ is given by @xmath134,\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the swap operator , defined by its action on any product ket , @xmath136 . 
 this parameterization is chosen because @xmath137 is a werner state s expectation value with respect to @xmath135 , @xmath138 $ ] . 
 non - negativity is ensured by @xmath139 , and the completely mixed state corresponds to @xmath140 . 
 furthermore , the concurrence of werner states is simply given by @xcite @xmath141}=-\psi^{- } , \;\;\ ; \psi^{- } \leq 0 . 
 \label{wc}\ ] ] for @xmath142 , the concurrence is defined to be zero , indicating separability . 
 werner states have been experimentally characterized for photonic qubits , see e.g. @xcite . 
 interestingly , they can be dissipatively prepared as the steady state of coherently driven atoms subject to collective spontaneous decay @xcite . 
 isotropic states are defined , similarly , as the one - parameter family that is invariant under transformations of the form @xmath143 @xcite . 
 we parameterize these states as @xmath144,\ ] ] where @xmath145 . 
 the value of the parameter is given by the expectation value with respect to the partially transposed swap operator , @xmath146}$ ] , and is related to the so - called `` singlet fraction '' @xcite by @xmath147 . 
 non - negativity is now ensured by @xmath148 , whereas the concurrence is given by @xcite , @xmath149 and is defined to be zero for @xmath150 .    before introducing probability distributions that will serve as the analogue classical states , we present an alternative way to think of werner states , which will prove useful later . 
 first , the highest purity , attained for the @xmath151 state , is @xmath152 $ ] , with the absolute maximum of 1 corresponding to the pure singlet state for @xmath153 . 
 second , collective projective measurements on a most - entangled werner state return only disagreeing outcomes ( e.g. , corresponding to @xmath154 , but not @xmath155 ) . 
 the following construction of bipartite werner states demonstrates the origin of both of these essential features . for generic @xmath1 , the analogue to the singlet state 
 is the following @xmath1-partite fully anti - symmetric state : @xmath156 where , as before , @xmath157 denotes the permutation group and @xmath158 is an orthonormal basis on @xmath159 . 
 the above state has the property of being `` completely disagreeing '' , in the sense that a collective measurement returns outcomes that differ on each qudit with certainty . 
 the most - entangled _ bipartite _ qudit werner state is nothing but the two - party reduced state of @xmath160 . 
 thus , we can think of general bipartite qudit werner states as mixtures of the completely mixed state with the two - party - reduction of @xmath160 . 
 the inverse of @xmath152 $ ] ( the purity ) is precisely the number of ways two `` dits '' can disagree . 
 understanding bipartite werner states to arise from reduced states of @xmath160 will inform our construction of the classical analogue states , and also help us understand some of the results of sec . 
 [ subsec : wjoin ] and [ subsec : wsharability ] .    for werner states , increased entanglement corresponds to increased `` disagreement '' for collective measurement outcomes . 
 for isotropic states , increased entanglement corresponds to increased `` agreement '' of collective measurements , but only with respect to the computational basis @xmath161 relative to which such states are defined . 
 it is this expression of agreement vs. disagreement of outcomes which carries over to the classical analogue states , which we are now ready to introduce . 
 the relevant probability distributions are defined on the outcome space @xmath162 . to resemble werner and isotropic quantum states 
 , these probability distributions should have completely mixed marginal distributions and range from maximal disagreement to maximal agreement . 
 this is achieved by an interpolation between an even mixture of `` agreeing pure states '' , namely , @xmath163 , and an even mixture of all possible `` disagreeing pure states '' , namely , @xmath164 . 
 that is : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the probability that the two outcomes agree .    to make the analogy complete , it is desirable to relate @xmath166 to both @xmath137 and @xmath167 . 
 we define @xmath166 in the quantum cases to be the probability of obtaining @xmath168 on system @xmath4 , conditional to outcome @xmath168 on system @xmath5 for the projective measurement @xmath169 . for werner states , 
 this probability is related to @xmath170 by @xmath171 and , similarly for isotropic states , we have @xmath172 we may thus re - parameterize both the werner and isotropic states in terms of their respective above - defined `` probabilities of agreement '' , namely : @xmath173 ,   \label{eq : agreementparamwer}\\ \hspace*{-6 mm } \rho(\alpha_i)&\hspace*{-0.5mm}=\hspace*{-0.5mm}&\frac{d}{d-1}\left [ ( 1-\alpha_i)\frac{{\mathbb{i}}}{d^2}+ \big ( \alpha_i- \frac{1}{d}\big){{| \phi^{+ } \rangle}{\langle \phi^{+ } |}}\right ] , \label{eq : agreementparamiso } \end{aligned}\ ] ] subject to the conditions @xmath174    for werner states , @xmath175 can rightly be considered a probability of agreement because it is independent of the choice of local basis vectors in the projective measurement @xmath176 . 
 for isotropic states , @xmath177 does not have as direct an interpretation . 
 we may nevertheless interpret @xmath166 as a probability of basis - independent agreement if we pair local basis vectors on @xmath4 with their complex conjugates on @xmath5 . 
 in other words , @xmath177 can be thought of as the probability of agreement for local projective measurements of the form @xmath178 @xcite .      in order to determine the joinability limitations in the classical case , we begin by noting that any ( finite - dimensional ) classical probability distribution is a unique convex combination of the pure states of the system . in our case 
 , there are five extremal three - party states , for which the two - party marginals are classical analogue states , as defined in eq . 
 ( [ eq : classicalw ] ) . 
 these are @xmath179 where @xmath180 stands for the pure probability distribution @xmath181 . 
 the first four of these states are valid for all @xmath182 and each corresponds to a vertex of a tetrahedron , as depicted in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](left ) . 
 the fifth state is only valid for @xmath183 and corresponds to the point @xmath184 in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](right ) . 
 any valid three - party state for which the two - party marginals are classical analogue states must be a convex combination of the above states . 
 therefore , the joinable - unjoinable boundary is delimited by the boundary of their convex hull . for the @xmath153 case , 
 the inequalities describing these boundaries are explicitly given by the following : @xmath185 where each inequality arises from requiring that the corresponding extremal state has a non - negative likelihood . in the @xmath183 case , 
 the inequality @xmath186 is replaced by @xmath187 . 
 we now present our results on the three - party joinability of werner and isotropic states and then compare them to the classical limitations just found in the previous section . 
 while , as mentioned , all the technical proofs are post - poned to appendix [ sec : joiningreptools ] in order to ease readability , the basic idea is to exploit the high degree of symmetry that these classes of states enjoy . 
 consider werner states first . 
 our starting point is to observe that if a tripartite state @xmath28 joins two reduced werner states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the `` twirled state '' @xmath188 , given by @xmath189 is also a valid joining state . in eq . 
 ( [ twirlapp ] ) , @xmath190 denotes the invariant haar measure on @xmath191 , and the twirling super - operator effects a projection into the subspace of operators with collective unitary invariance @xcite . by invoking the schur - weyl duality @xcite , the guaranteed existence of joining states with these symmetries allows one to narrow the search for valid joining states to the hermitian subspace spanned by representations of subsystem permutations , that is , density operators of the form @xmath192 where hermiticity demands that @xmath193 . given @xmath28 which joins werner states , each subsystem pair is characterized by the expectation value with the respective swap operator , @xmath194,$ ] where @xmath195 with @xmath196 . 
 hence , the task is to determine for which @xmath197 there exists a density operator @xmath28 consistent with the above expectations . 
 our main result is the following :    [ triower ] three werner qudit states with parameters @xmath198 are joinable if and only if @xmath197 lies within the bi - cone described by @xmath199 for @xmath183 , or within the cone described by @xmath200 for @xmath153 , where @xmath201    similarly , if a tripartite state @xmath28 joins isotropic states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the `` isotropic - twirled state '' @xmath188 , given by @xmath202 is also a valid joining state . 
 a clarification is , however , in order at this point : although we have been referring to the isotropic joinability scenario of interest as three - party isotropic state joining , this is somewhat of a misnomer because we effectively consider the pair @xmath5-@xmath6 to be in a werner state , as evident from eq . 
 ( [ twirliso ] ) . compared to eq . 
 ( [ permrepspan ] ) , the relevant search space is now partially transposed relative to subsystem @xmath4 , that is , consisting of density operators of the form @xmath203 our main result for three - party joinability of isotropic states is then contained in the following :    [ trioiso ] two isotropic qudit states @xmath62 and @xmath63 and qudit werner state @xmath204 with parameters @xmath205 are joinable if and only if @xmath206 lies within the cone described by @xmath207 @xmath208 @xmath209 or , for @xmath210 , within the convex hull of the above cone and the point @xmath211 . 
 the results of theorems [ triower ] and [ trioiso ] as well as of sec . [ 
 sec : classicaljoining ] are pictorially summarized in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison ] . 
 we now compare these quantum joinability limitations to the joinability limitations in place for classical analogue states . as described in sec . 
 [ sec : classicaljoining ] , the non - negativity of @xmath212 and @xmath213 is enforced by the two inequalities @xmath214 and @xmath215 , respectively . 
 we expect the same requirement to be enforced by the analogue quantum - measurement statistics . for @xmath153 , 
 the bases of the werner and isotropic joinability - limitation cones are determined by @xmath216 and @xmath217 , respectively . 
 writing down each of these parameters in terms of the appropriate probability of agreement @xmath166 , as defined in eqs . 
 ( [ agreewer ] ) and ( [ agreeiso ] ) , we obtain @xmath214 and @xmath215 . 
 hence , for qubits , part of the quantum joining limitations are indeed derived from the classical joining limitations . 
 this is also illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](left ) . of course 
 , one would not expect the quantum scenario to exhibit violations of the classical joinability restrictions ; still , it is interesting that states which exhibit manifestly non - classical correlations may nonetheless saturate bounds obtained from purely classical joining limitations .    for @xmath210 , 
 the only classical boundary which plays a role is the one which bounds the base of the isotropic joinability - limitation cone : @xmath218 . 
 again , in terms of the agreement parameters , this is ( just as for qubits ) @xmath215 . 
 in the werner case , the quantum joinability boundary is not clearly delineated by the classical joining limitations . 
 we can nevertheless make the following observation . by the non - negativity of werner states , the three - party joinability region in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](right ) is required to lie within a cube of side - length @xmath219 with one corner at @xmath220 . 
 consider the set of cubes obtained by rotating from this initial cube about an axis through @xmath220 and @xmath221 . 
 it is a curious fact that the exact quantum werner joinability region ( the bi - cone ) is precisely the _ intersection _ of all such cubes . 
 another interesting feature is that there exist _ trios of unentangled werner states which are not joinable_. for example , the point @xmath222 corresponds to three separable werner states that are not joinable . 
 this point is of particular interest because its classical analogue _ is _ joinable . 
 translating @xmath223 into the agreement - probability coordinates , @xmath224 , we see that this point is actually on the classical joining limitation border . thus , these three separable , correlated states are not joinable for purely quantum mechanical reasons . 
 note that the point @xmath224 does correspond to a joinable trio of pairs in the isotropic three - party joining scenario : this point lies at the center of the face of the isotropic joinability cone , as seen in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](left ) . 
 the same fact holds for @xmath225 or @xmath226 when the werner state pair in the isotropic joining scenario describes @xmath4-@xmath6 or @xmath4-@xmath5 , respectively ; in both cases , we would have obtained yet another cone in fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison ] that sits on a face of the classical tetrahedron boundary . 
 having determined the joinable trios of both werner and isotropic states , we are now in a position to also answer the question of what _ pairs _ @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 of states are joinable with one another . in the werner state case , this is obtained by projecting the werner joinability bicone down to the @xmath227-@xmath228 plane , resulting in the following :    two pairs of qudit werner states with parameters @xmath227 and @xmath228 are joinable if and only if @xmath229 , or if the parameters satisfy @xmath230 or additionally , in the case @xmath183 , if @xmath231 .    for isotropic states , we may similarly project the cone of eq . 
 ( [ d1isoa ] ) onto the @xmath232-@xmath233 plane to obtain the 1 - 2 joining boundary . 
 this yields the following :    [ isocoro ] two pairs of qudit isotropic states with parameters @xmath232 and @xmath233 are joinable if and only if they lie within the convex hull of the ellipse @xmath234 and the point @xmath235 . 
 lastly , by a similar projection of the isotropic cone given by eqs . 
 ( [ d1iso])-([d1isoa ] ) , we may explicitly characterize the werner - isotropic hybrid 1 - 2 joining boundary :    [ projectioncorohybrid ] an isotropic state with parameter @xmath232 and a werner state with parameter @xmath236 are joinable if and only if they lie within the convex hull of the ellipse @xmath237 and the point @xmath238 , and , for @xmath210 , within the additional convex hull introduced by the point @xmath238 . 
 the above results give the exact quantum - mechanical rules for the two - pair joinability of werner and isotropic states , as pictorially summarized in see figs . 
 [ fig : wernerpairjoinability ] and [ fig : isotropicpairjoinability ] 
 . a number of interesting features are worth noticing . 
 first , by restricting to the line where @xmath239 , we can conclude that qubit werner states are @xmath52-@xmath240 sharable if and only if @xmath241 , whereas for @xmath210 , all qudit werner states are @xmath52-@xmath240 sharable . as we shall see 
 , this agrees with the more general analysis of sec . 
 [ subsec : wsharability ] . 
 second , some insight into the role of entanglement in limiting joinability may be gained . in the first quadrant of fig . 
 [ fig : wernerpairjoinability ] , where neither pair is entangled , it is no surprise that no joinability restrictions apply . 
 likewise , it is not surprising to see that , in the third quadrant where both pairs are entangled , there is a trade - off between the amount of entanglement allowed between one pair and that of the other . 
 but , in the second and fourth quadrants we observe a more interesting behavior . 
 namely , these quadrants show that there is also a _ trade - off between the amount of classical correlation in one pair and the amount of entanglement in the other pair_. in fact , the smoothness of the boundary curve as it crosses from one of the pairs being entangled to unentangled suggests that , at least in this case , entanglement is not the correct figure of merit in diagnosing joinability limitations . 
 interestingly , the above results for 1 - 2 joinability of isotropic states can also be obtained by drawing upon existing results for asymmetric quantum cloning , see e.g. @xcite for 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 asymmetric cloning and @xcite for 1-@xmath3 asymmetric cloning . 
 one approach to obtaining the optimal asymmetric cloning machine is to exploit the choi isomorphism @xcite to translate the construction of the optimal cloning map to the construction of an optimal operator ( or a `` telemapping state '' ) . 
 this connection is made fairly clear in @xcite ; in particular , `` singlet monogamy '' refers to the trade - off in fidelities of the optimal 1-@xmath3 asymmetric cloning machine or , equivalently , to the trade - off in singlet fractions for a @xmath242 qudit state . 
 we describe how the approach to solving the optimal 1-@xmath3 asymmetric cloning problem may be rephrased to solve the 1-@xmath3 joinability problem for isotropic states . 
 the state @xmath243 described in eq . 
 ( 4 ) of @xcite is a 1-@xmath3 joining state for @xmath3 isotropic states characterized by singlet fractions @xmath244 ( related to the isotropic state parameter by @xmath245 , as noted ) . 
 the bounds on the singlet fractions are determined by the normalization condition of @xmath243 , together with the requirement that @xmath243 be an eigenstate of a certain operator @xmath115 defined in eq . 
 ( 3 ) of @xcite . that @xmath243 is an isotropic joining state 
 is readily seen from its construction , and that it may optimize the singlet fractions ( hence delineate the boundary in the @xmath246 space ) is proven in @xcite . 
 our contribution here is the observation that this result provides the solution to the 1-@xmath3 joinability of isotropic states . 
 the equivalence is established by the fact that optimality is preserved in either direction by the choi isomorphism . 
 quantitatively , the boundary for 1-@xmath3 optimal asymmetric cloning , is given by eq . 
 ( 6 ) in @xcite in terms of singlet fractions . 
 specializing to the 1 - 2 joining case and rewriting in terms of @xmath247 , we have @xmath248 as one may verify , this is equivalent to the result of corollary [ isocoro ] . in light of this connection , the fact that , as @xmath1 increases , the isotropic - joinability cone of fig . 
 [ fig : correlationcomparison](right ) becomes flattened down to the @xmath249-@xmath250 plane is directly related to the _ linear trade - off _ in the isotropic state parameters for the semi - classical limit @xmath251 , as discussed in @xcite . within our three - party joining picture , we can give a partial explanation of this fact : namely , it is a consequence of the classical joining boundary in tandem with the upper limit on the agreement parameter @xmath252 for the werner state on @xmath5-@xmath6 : @xmath253 . in the limit of @xmath251 , 
 these two boundaries conspire to limit the ( @xmath4-@xmath5)-(@xmath4-@xmath6 ) isotropic state joining boundary to a triangle , as explicitly seen in fig . 
 [ fig : isotropicpairjoinability](right ) .    for the general 1-@xmath3 isotropic joining scenario 
 , the quantum - cloning results additionally imply the following :    a list of @xmath3 isotropic states characterized by parameters @xmath254 is 1-@xmath3 joinable if and only if the ( positive - valued ) parameters satisfy @xmath255 [ thm:1njoiningiso ]    interestingly , similar to our discussion surrounding eq . 
 ( [ ckwweak ] ) , the authors of @xcite argue how the `` singlet monogamy '' bound can lead to stricter predictions ( e.g. , on ground - state energies in many - body spin systems ) than the standard monogamy of entanglement bounds based on ckw inequalities @xcite . 
 we next turn to sharability of werner and isotropic states in @xmath1 dimension , beginning from the important case of @xmath52-@xmath3 sharing . for werner states , a proof based on a representation - theoretic approach is given in appendix [ sec : sharingreptools ] . 
 although we expect a similar proof to exist for isotropic states , we obtain the desired @xmath52-@xmath3 sharability result by building on the relationship with quantum cloning problems highlighted above . 
 we then outline a constructive procedure for determining the more general @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability of werner states . 
 our main results are contained in the following :    [ thm:1nsharability ] a qudit werner state with parameter @xmath170 is @xmath52-@xmath3 sharable if and only if @xmath256    [ thm:1nsharabilityiso ] a qudit isotropic state with parameter @xmath247 is @xmath52-@xmath3 sharable if and only if @xmath257    specializing eq . 
 ( [ eq:1njoiningiso ] ) to the case of equal parameters for all @xmath3 isotropic states , the above result immediately follows . as stated in @xcite , 
 this is consistent with the well known result for optimal 1-@xmath3 symmetric cloning .    a pictorial representation of the above sharability results , specialized to qubits , is given in fig . 
 [ fig : sharability ] . in the case of werner state sharing , 
 ( [ wsharing ] ) implies that a _ finite _ 
 parameter range exists where the corresponding werner states are _ not _ sharable . in contrast , for @xmath210 , every werner state is at least @xmath52-@xmath240 sharable . 
 this simply reflects the fact that @xmath160 ( recall eq . 
 ( [ eq : purewerner ] ) ) provides a 1-@xmath258 sharing state for a most - entangled qudit werner state . with isotropic state sharing , 
 for all @xmath1 there is , again , a _ finite _ range of isotropic states which are not sharable .    ) and ( [ isosharing ] ) . 
 the arrow - headed lines depict the parameter range for which states satisfy each of the sharability properties displayed to the right and left , respectively .

 the arrow - headed lines depict the parameter range for which states satisfy each of the sharability properties displayed to the right and left , respectively . 
 the vertical ticks between end points of these ranges indicate the points at which subsequent @xmath52-@xmath3 sharability properties begin to be satisfied . 
 , title=""fig : "" ]    the simplicity of the results in eqs . 
 ( [ wsharing])-([isosharing ] ) is intriguing and begs for intuitive interpretations . 
 consider a central qudit surrounded by @xmath3 outer qudits . 
 if the central qudit is in the same werner or isotropic state with each outer qudit , then theorems [ thm:1nsharability ] and [ thm:1nsharabilityiso ] can be reinterpreted as providing a bound on the sums of concurrences . for werner states 
 , we have that the sum of all the central - to - outer concurrences can not exceed the number of modes by which the systems may disagree ( i.e. , @xmath259 ) . in the isotropic state case , the sum of the @xmath3 pairwise concurrences can not exceed the maximal concurrence value given by @xmath260 . 
 these rules do not hold in more general joining scenarios , as we already know from sec . 
 [ subsec : wjoin ] . 
 there , we found that the trade - off between @xmath4-@xmath5 concurrence and @xmath4-@xmath6 concurrence is not a linear one , as such a simple `` sum rule '' would predict ; instead , it traces out an ellipse ( recall fig . 
 [ fig : wernerpairjoinability ] ) .    starting from the proof of thm . 
 [ thm:1nsharability ] found in appendix [ sec : sharingreptools ] , in conjunction with similar representation - theoretic tools , it is possible to devise a constructive algorithm for determining the @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability of werner states . 
 the basic observation is to realize that the most - entangled @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable werner state corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of a certain hamiltonian operator @xmath261 , which is in turn expressible in terms of casimir operators . 
 calculation of these eigenvalues may be obtained using young diagrams . 
 although we lack a general closed - form expression for @xmath262 , the required calculation can nevertheless be performed numerically . 
 representative results for @xmath3-@xmath2 sharability of low - dimensional werner states are shown in table [ tab : nmsharability ] . 
 \(a ) @xmath153 ( b ) @xmath263 ( c ) @xmath264 +    .exact results for @xmath3-@xmath2 sharability of werner states for different subsystem dimension , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 increasing from left to right and from top to bottom in each table , respectively . for each sharability setting , the value @xmath265 is given . 
 asterisks correponds to entries whose values have not been explicitly computed . [ 
 cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ tab : nmsharability ] 
 in sec . [ sec : wernerstates ] , we focused on considering joinability of three bipartite ( werner or isotropic ) states in a `` triangular fashion '' , namely , relatively to the simplest overlapping neighborhood structure @xmath266 , @xmath267 on @xmath268 . in a more general @xmath0-partite scenario , other neighborhood structures and associated joinability problems may naturally emerge . 
 for instance , we may want to answer the following question : which sets of @xmath269 werner - state ( or isotropic - state ) pairs are joinable ? 
 the approach to solving this more general problem parallels the specific three - party case we discussed . 
 if each pair is in a werner state , then if a joining state exists , there must exist a joining state with collective invariant symmetry ( that is , invariant under arbitrary collective unitaries @xmath270 ) . 
 thus , we need only look in the set of states respecting this symmetry 
 . any such operator may be decomposed into a sum of operators , which each have support on just a single irreducible subspace . 
 this is useful because positivity of the joining operator when restricted to each irreducible subspace is sufficient for positivity of the overall operator . 
 the joining operators may then be decomposed into the projectors on each irreducible subspace and corresponding bases of traceless operators on the projectors . 
 the basis elements will be combinations of permutation operators and the dimension of each such operator subspaces is given by the square of the hook length of the corresponding young diagram @xcite . 
 the remaining task is to obtain a characterization of the positivity of the operators on _ each _ irreducible subspace . in @xcite , for example , a method for characterizing the positivity of low - dimensional operator spaces is presented . 
 as long as the number of subsystems remains small , this approach grants us a computationally friendly characterization of positivity of the joining states . 
 the bounds on the joinable werner pairs may then be obtained by projecting the positivity characterization boundary onto the space of werner pairs , analogous to the space of fig . 
 [ fig : wernerpairjoinability ] . 
 while a complete analysis is beyond our scope , a similar method may in principle be followed to determine more general joinability bounds for isotropic states . however , a twirling operation that preserves the joining property only exists for certain isotropic joining scenarios . 
 for instance , we took this issue into consideration when we required the @xmath5-@xmath6 system to be in a werner state while @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 were isotropic states ; it would not have been possible to take the same approach if all three pairs were isotropic states .      for qubit werner states 
 , one can use the methods of the proof of thm . 
 iii.6 to show that @xmath52-@xmath3 sharability does imply @xmath3-@xmath3 sharability [ cf . table i.(a ) ] . 
 this property neither holds for werner qudit states nor bipartite qubit states in general . 
 the simplest example of a werner state which disobeys this property is the most - entangled qutrit werner state @xmath271 . 
 this state is 1 - 2 sharable , as evidenced by the point @xmath272 lying within the bi - cone described by eq . 
 ( [ d1 ] ) . 
 the corresponding sharing state is the totally antisymmetric state on three qutrits as given by eq . 
 ( [ eq : purewerner ] ) . 
 this is the unique sharing state because the collective disagreement between the subsystems of each joined bipartite werner state forces collective disagreement among the subsystems of the tripartite joining state ; the totally antisymmetric state is the only quantum state satisfying this property . 
 since the only 1 - 2 sharing state for @xmath271 is pure and entangled , clearly there can exist no 2 - 2 sharing . 
 additionally , we present below a counter - example that involves qubit states off the werner line :    for a generic bipartite qubit state @xmath48 , @xmath52-@xmath3 sharability does not imply @xmath3-@xmath3 sharability . 
 we claim that the following bipartite state on two qubits , @xmath273 \equiv \rho_{l_1 r_1},\ ] ] is 1 - 2 sharable but not 2 - 2 sharable . to show that @xmath48 is @xmath52-@xmath240 sharable 
 , direct calculation shows that the two relevant partial - trace constraints uniquely identify @xmath274 as the only valid sharing state , with @xmath275 the above state may in turn be equivalently written as @xmath276 in order for @xmath48 to be 2 - 2 sharable , a four - partite state @xmath277 must exist , such that tr@xmath278 , for @xmath279 . 
 any state which 2 - 2 shares @xmath48 must then 1 - 2 share the pure entangled state @xmath280 . 
 that is , in constructing the 2 - 2 sharing state for @xmath48 , we bring in a fourth system @xmath281 which must reduce ( by tracing over @xmath282 or @xmath281 ) to @xmath280 . 
 but , since @xmath280 is a pure entangled state , it is not sharable . 
 thus , there can not exist a 2 - 2 sharing state for @xmath48 . 
 we conclude by stressing that our werner and isotropic state sharability results allow in fact to put bounds ( though not necessarily tight ones ) on the sharability of an _ arbitrary bipartite qudit state_. it suffices to observe that any bipartite state can be transformed into a werner or isotropic state by the action of the respective twirling map ( either eq . ( [ twirlapp ] ) or ( [ twirliso ] ) ) . 
 theorem [ thm : locc ] proves that the sharability of a state can not be decreased by a unitary mixture map , and hence twirling can not decrease sharability . 
 this thus establishes the following :    a bipartite qudit state @xmath48 is no more sharable than the werner state @xmath283 and the isotropic state @xmath284 for any @xmath285 , with @xmath286 .    in the qubit case , 
 for instance , any maximally entangled pure state can be transformed into @xmath287 or @xmath288 by the action of some local unitary @xmath289 . 
 thus , all maximally entangled pure qubit states and their `` pseudo - pure '' versions , obtained as mixtures with the fully mixed states , have the same sharability properties as the werner / isotropic states . 
 we have provided a general framework for defining the notions of quantum joinability and sharability in finite - dimensional multipartite quantum systems , and compared both to the analogous classical notions . 
 special emphasis has been given to identifying the role of entanglement in both scenarios . in order to obtain mathematically necessary and sufficient conditions , 
 we have specifically analyzed the three - party joinability and the @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability properties of qudit werner and isotropic states . 
 we found that the entanglement content of the joined bipartite states does _ not _ suffice to determine the resulting joinability properties . 
 additionally , we analyzed the role that the classical joining limitations play in restricting quantum joining in these scenarios . 
 as a byproduct , this led to an explanation for the linear trade - off in singlet fractions ( or cloning fidelities ) as @xmath290 . 
 we further determined simple analytical expressions for 1-@xmath3 sharability , namely , that the sum of the bipartite concurrences can not exceed @xmath258 for werner states and can not exceed @xmath291 for isotropic states . in the more general case of @xmath2-@xmath3 sharing , we laid out an algorithmic procedure for calculating the most - entangled @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable werner states using young diagrams . as a corollary of our results , we established upper bounds on the sharability of _ arbitrary _ bipartite qudit states . 
 several open questions remain for future investigations . the use of the choi isomorphism in translating between 1-@xmath3 joining scenarios and cloning scenarios points to an intriguing connection between the mathematical structures of reduced quantum states and reduced channels . pushing this connection further , we believe it would be fruitful to investigate the analogous problem of _ joining quantum channels _ , making contact , in particular , with recent work on extending quantum operations @xcite .    also related to channels , we would like to continue investigating the effects of different maps on the sharability properties of the input states . in thm . 
 [ thm : locc ] , we showed that mixtures of local unitaries can not decrease sharability 
 . it would be interesting to obtain a characterization of the set of maps which do not decrease sharability and compare them to locc maps which are known to not increase entanglement . 
 since we do not have a counterexample to the statement , we conjecture that sharability can not be decreased by _ any _ locc map .    keeping with the approach pursued here , further progress toward obtaining necessary and sufficient joinability conditions 
 may be made by narrowing the set of states to be analyzed to other physically relevant families and/or specific joining structures . 
 for instance , families of mixed qudit states may arise as reduced states of many - body ground states of spin-1/2 or higher spin hamiltonians parametrized by an external control parameter . in this context 
 , it may be insighful to examine what joinability and sharability features of quantum correlations change as the system is driven across a quantum phase transition , complementing extensive investigation of ground - state entanglement @xcite and generalized entanglement @xcite in critical phenomena . 
 finally , since generalized entanglement is defined _ without _ relying on a preferred tensor - product decomposition , with `` generalized reduced states '' being constructed through a suitable reduction map relative to observable subspaces @xcite , a natural question arises : what is the nature and role of joinability limitations _ beyond subsystems _ ? 
 we leave exploration of this intriguing question to future research .

 as remarked in sec . 
 ii , joinability limitations are a manifestation of the non - negativity constraint placed on the joining density operators . 
 symmetries of the reduced states allow us to both narrow our search for a joining state and to obtain simple characterizations of non - negativity . for both werner and isotropic states , the relevant search space for valid three - partite joining states may be characterized in terms of suitable subsystem permutation operators , according to eqs . 
 ( [ permrepspan ] ) and ( [ eq : ptrep ] ) , respectively . 
 such parameterizations do not offer , however , a straightforward characterization of non - negativity . to this end 
 , we need to choose a different basis for which non - negativity is more simply expressed in terms of its ( the basis ) coefficients . 
 the key idea is to decompose the operator space into subspaces for which the non - negativity of a given operator s projection into each subspace ensures the non - negativity of the given operator . 
 this is achieved if the operators within each operator subspace act non - trivially on orthogonal vector subspaces . 
 irreducible representations ( irreps ) provide such a decomposition .    for the symmetric group @xmath292 , the irrep subspaces are projected into by the so - called young symmetrizers . 
 the prescription for constructing young symmetrizers from the permutation representations may be found in most books on representation theory , see e.g. @xcite . in our case , @xmath293 , the group @xmath294 has three inequivalent irreps , and the relevant young symmetrizers read @xmath295 , \nonumber \\ r_-&\hspace*{-1mm}=\hspace*{-1 mm } & \frac{1}{6}\big[\mathbb{i}-v_{(ab)}-v_{(bc)}-v_{(ca)}+v_{(abc)}+v_{(cba)}\big ] , \nonumber \\ r_0&\hspace*{-1mm}=\hspace*{-1 mm } & \frac{1}{3}\big [ 2\mathbb{i}-v_{(abc)}-v_{(cba)}\big ] , \label{young}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where , by following ref 
 . @xcite , we use cycle notation to label permutation elements , and an orthonormal basis of pauli - like operators acting on the support of @xmath296 is @xmath297,\nonumber \\ r_2&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\big [ v_{(ab)}-v_{(ca)}\big],\nonumber \\ r_3&=&\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\big [ v_{(abc)}-v_{(cba)}\big ] . 
 \label{rs}\end{aligned}\ ] ] defining @xmath298 , any @xmath299 is of the form @xmath300 where @xmath301 . 
 normalization is ensured by @xmath302 while non - negativity is given by the following simple relationships : @xmath303    following again ref . 
 @xcite ( see in particular sec . 
 vi.a ) , the analogous decomposition of operators of the form given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : ptrep ] ) into orthogonal projectors reads @xmath304 , \nonumber \\ 
 s_-&\hspace*{-1mm}=\frac{1}{2}\big[{\mathbb{i}}-v_{(bc)}+\frac{v_{(abc)}^{t_a}+v_{(cba)}^{t_a}-v_{(ab)}^{t_a}-v_{(ac)}^{t_a}}{d-1}\big ] , \nonumber \\ s_0&\hspace*{-1mm}=\frac{1}{d^2 - 1}\big[d(v_{(ab)}^{t_a}+v_{(ac)}^{t_a})-(v_{(abc)}^{t_a}+v_{(cba)}^{t_a})\big ] , \label{youngiso}\end{aligned}\ ] ] whereas an orthonormal basis of operators acting on the support of @xmath305 is @xmath306,\nonumber \\ s_2=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2 - 1}}\big[v_{(ab)}^{t_a}-v_{(ac)}^{t_a}\big],\nonumber \\ s_3=&\frac{i}{\sqrt{d^2 - 1}}\big [ v_{(abc)}^{t_a}-v_{(cba)}^{t_a}\big ] . 
 \label{rsiso}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in complete analogy , we define @xmath307 . 
 then any joining state @xmath308 is of the form @xmath309 where @xmath310 . 
 normalization is ensured by @xmath311 and non - negativity is given by @xmath312    given the above decompositions of three - party joining operators , we are now equipped to formally prove our three - party joining results . 
 [ triowerapp ] three werner qudit states with parameters @xmath198 are joinable if and only if @xmath197 lies within the bicone described by @xmath313 for @xmath183 , or within the cone described by @xmath314 for @xmath153 , where @xmath315    following @xcite , we reparameterize the space described by eq . 
 ( [ permrepspan ] ) in terms of operators whose actions are restricted to irreducible subspaces . 
 this allows us to enforce non - negativity in a straightforward manner . 
 specifically ( see appendix [ sec : joiningreptools ] ) , the relevant parameters are the expectation values @xmath316 of the operators defined in eqs . 
 ( [ young ] ) and ( [ rs ] ) , and non - negativity is enforced by @xmath317 and the spherical inequality @xmath318 . 
 these joinability limitations are derived by re - expressing the non - negativity constraints of eq . 
 ( [ eq : nonnegconstraints ] ) in terms of werner parameters @xmath319 . 
 we have : @xmath320}\right|^2\nonumber\\ & = \frac{4}{9}\left|\psi^{-}_{bc}+\omega \psi^{-}_{ac}+\omega^2\psi^{-}_{ab}\right|^2,\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath321}-2r_-\nonumber\\ & = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i < j}[(1 - 2r_-)-\psi^{-}_{ij}]=1 - 2r_--\overline{\psi^{-}},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath322 is defined in eq . 
 ( [ phibar ] ) . 
 thus , the spherical inequality @xmath318 may be rewritten as @xmath323 since a non - zero value of @xmath324 only further limits the inequality and since the @xmath319 are independent of it , we maximize the range of joinable @xmath319 by setting @xmath325 .    the non - negativity is then expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath319 and @xmath326 as @xmath327 where the normalization condition allows us to write the @xmath328-non - negativity condition as eq . ( [ conebase1 ] ) and 
 the non - negativity of @xmath329 allows us to take the square - root of eq . 
 ( [ sphericalineq ] ) to obtain eq . 
 ( [ gencone ] ) .    for each @xmath322 
 , we set @xmath326 so as to maximize the left hand side of eq . 
 ( [ gencone ] ) while satisfying eq . 
 ( [ conebase1 ] ) and eq . 
 ( [ conebase2 ] ) . 
 let @xmath210 . 
 for @xmath330 we set @xmath331 , while for @xmath332 , we set @xmath333 . considering these two cases together , we find that the region of joinable @xmath197 is given precisely by eq . 
 ( [ d1app ] ) [ eq . 
 ( [ d1 ] ) in the main text ] . if @xmath153 , we have @xmath331 , thus simplifying eq . 
 ( [ gencone ] ) and eq . 
 ( [ conebase1 ] ) to eq . 
 ( [ d2bapp ] ) [ eq . 
 ( [ d2b ] ) ] , as desired . 
 [ trioisoapp ] two isotropic qubit states @xmath62 and @xmath63 and qudit werner state @xmath204 with parameters @xmath205 are joinable if and only if @xmath206 lies within the cone described by @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath209 or , for @xmath210 , within the convex hull of the above cone and the point @xmath211 .    by proceeding in analogy to the werner s case , we need to re - express the non - negativity constraints in terms of the relevant reduced state parameters . 
 we have @xmath336}|^2\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath337.\end{aligned}\ ] ] setting @xmath338 and enforcing the normalization condition @xmath339 , we can additionally write @xmath340 thus , the desired expression for @xmath341 is @xmath342,\end{aligned}\ ] ] which allows us to write @xmath343 in terms of the reduced state parameters : @xmath344 where @xmath345 is given by the expression above . 
 next , we obtain an expression for @xmath346 in terms of the reduced state parameters . using eq . 
 ( [ eq : normalization ] ) , we can write @xmath347 thus , the spherical non - negativity constraint may be written in terms of the reduced state parameters as the desired result . 
 furthermore , the non - negativity of @xmath346 provides the boundary forming the base of the cone : @xmath218 . 
 if @xmath183 , we have the possibility that @xmath348 . 
 considering the maximal value of @xmath349 , we add the point @xmath211 as another extremal non - negative point . for @xmath183 , the convex hull of the cone and this point 
 constitutes the region of reduced state parameter trios which correspond to joinable bipartite states . 
 [ projectioncorowerapp ] two pairs of qudit werner states with parameters @xmath227 and @xmath228 are joinable if and only if @xmath229 , or if the parameters satisfy @xmath350 or additionally , in the case @xmath183 , if @xmath231 .    to obtain these conditions 
 , it suffices to project the shape given in eq . 
 ( [ d2bapp ] ) onto the @xmath227-@xmath228 plane . the rim of the cone / bicone projects down to an ellipse whose equation we obtain by extremizing eq . 
 ( [ d1app ] ) evaluated at the cone base @xmath351 . setting @xmath352 , we find the boundary to be @xmath353 . 
 any pairs of werner states within this ellipse are joinable . 
 we also have that @xmath354 and @xmath355 are joinable since setting @xmath356 causes the three to satisfy eq . 
 ( [ d1app ] ) . then , by the convexity of the set of joining states , the convex hull of @xmath357 and the ellipse corresponds to pairs of joinable states . if @xmath183 , the states @xmath358 and @xmath359 are joinable by setting @xmath360 , and hence the joinable @xmath361 ) pairs also include the convex hull of the ellipse with the point @xmath362 . 
 it remains to show that if @xmath227 or @xmath363 ( additionally , @xmath227 or @xmath364 for @xmath183 ) , then @xmath365 pairs outside of the ellipse are not joinable . to achieve this 
 , we consider a cone viewed from an arbitrary direction an infinite distance away . 
 the shape seen is the shape of the projection . from this vantage point 
 , the circular base of the cone appears as an ellipse . 
 the remaining visible area ( seen only if the vertex does not overlap with the base ) constitutes the projection of the cone s lateral surface . 
 the boundary of this projection is defined by the two lines extending from the vertex that are tangent to the ellipse . 
 the area contained between these two lines along with the hull of the ellipse constitutes the shape visible from the infinity perspective , or , in other words , the cone s projection . in our case , 
 the points at which these two lines ( four lines for the bicone ) intersect the ellipse are @xmath366 and @xmath367 ( additionally , @xmath368 and @xmath369 for the bicone ) . beyond these points , 
 the ellipse `` takes over '' as the projection boundary delimiter . 
 thus , points satisfying @xmath227 or @xmath363 ( and , @xmath227 or @xmath364 for the bicone ) are joinable if and only if they are within the ellipse boundary . 
 [ projectioncoroisoapp ] two pairs of qudit isotropic states with parameters @xmath232 and @xmath233 are joinable if and only if they lie within the convex hull of the ellipse @xmath370 and the point @xmath235 . 
 we follow the approach of the proof of corollary iii.3 above , by projecting the cone described by eqs . 
 ( [ d1isoapp1])-([d1isoapp2 ] ) down to the @xmath232-@xmath233 plane . 
 the rim of the cone projects down to an ellipse whose equation we obtain by extremizing eq . 
 ( [ d1isoapp1 ] ) evaluated at the cone base @xmath371 . setting @xmath372 , we find the boundary to be @xmath373 . from this 
 we easily obtain the ellipse described by eq . 
 ( [ eq : ellipseisoapp ] ) . 
 any pairs of werner states within this ellipse are joinable . 
 we also have that @xmath374 and @xmath375 are joinable since setting @xmath356 causes the three to satisfy eq . 
 ( [ d1isoapp1 ] ) . 
 the convex hull of the ellipse and the point @xmath376 exhausts the set of joinable pairs of isotropic states . 
 lastly , we explicitly provide the werner - isotropic hybrid 1 - 2 joining boundary :    [ projectioncorohybridapp ] an isotropic state with parameter @xmath232 and a werner state with parameter @xmath236 are joinable if and only if they lie within the convex hull of the ellipse @xmath377 and the point @xmath238 , and , for @xmath210 , within the additional convex hull introduced by the point @xmath238 .    obtained in an analogous manner to corollaries iii.3 and iii.4 . 
 here , we set up the necessary background , then determine the 1-@xmath3 sharability of werner states , while providing a constructive approach to determing @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability . for fixed @xmath2 , @xmath3 
 , we only need to determine the most - entangled werner state ( largest value of @xmath378 ) satisfying that sharability property ; as noted in sec . 
 [ sec : s ] , all mixtures of that state with any separable state will necessarily satisfy the sharability property . 
 thus , in the one - dimensional convex set parameterized by @xmath170 , the most - entangled werner state that satisfies a sharability property indicates the boundary between the satisfying and the failing region .    the next step is to map the problem of determining the most - entangled werner state for a given sharability criterion to the problem of determining the maximal eigenvalue of a particular operator . 
 specifically , we show that the most - entangled @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable werner state has concurrence equal to the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath379 and that a valid @xmath2-@xmath3 sharing state @xmath380 is given by the normalized projector into the corresponding eigenspace . 
 we first justify the construction of @xmath261 . from eq . 
 ( [ wc ] ) , the concurrence of a werner bipartite reduced state of a composite system state @xmath48 is @xmath381 . 
 so , for a state @xmath382 , with each @xmath114-@xmath115 pair a werner state , its expectation with respect to @xmath261 is simply the average concurrence of its @xmath114-@xmath115 pair reduced states . 
 now , that the normalized projector into an eigenspace of @xmath261 is a valid sharing state follows from the symmetries of this operator : collective unitary invariance ensures that the reduced states are werner states , while left - system permutation invariance and right - system permutation invariance ensure the @xmath2-@xmath3 sharing property . that the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath261 is the concurrence of the most - entangled @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable werner state follows from the fact that if any state @xmath383 were to share werner states with larger concurrence , its ( the sharing state s ) expectation value with respect to @xmath261 would exceed the maximum eigenvalue , which is a contradiction .      to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath261 
 , we express the latter in terms of quadratic casimir operators on @xmath0-fold tensor product of the ( defining ) @xmath1-dimensional representations of @xmath384 , namely , operators of the form @xmath385 where @xmath386 and @xmath387 span each of the @xmath0 local @xmath384 lie algebras . by construction , 
 any such casimir operator commutes with all the elements of the ( generally reducible ) tensor - product algebra . by rewriting each swap operator as @xmath388 
 , we obtain @xmath389 ^ 2 -\sum_{\alpha}\big[\sum_{i\in l}\lambda_i^{\alpha}\big]^2 \nonumber \\   -&\sum_{\alpha}\big[\sum_{j\in r}\lambda_j^{\alpha}\big]^2\bigg\ } = \frac{1}{2mn}\left(\lambda_{l}^2+\lambda_{r}^2-\lambda_{lr}^2\right)- \frac{{\mathbb{i}}}{d}. \nonumber \end{aligned}\ ] ] two relevant features of tensor - product casimir operators are worth noting . 
 first , @xmath390 will not simply be proportional to the identity operator , but rather , on each irreducible subspace it will act as a ( possibly ) different multiple of identity . secondly , the operator @xmath391 commutes with @xmath392 for any @xmath393 and @xmath0 . 
 the three casimir operators @xmath394 , @xmath395 , and @xmath396 mutually commute and it is thus meaningful to seek their simultaneous eigenvalues . 
 each eigenvalue of a tensor product casimir operator corresponds to an irreducible subspace @xmath397 and hence to a young diagram . 
 the latter may be used to compute the value of the corresponding eigenvalue . following @xcite , given a young diagram @xmath398 of column heights @xmath399 and row lengths @xmath400 , the eigenvalue of the corresponding space of the casimir operator is @xmath401 the eigenspaces of @xmath394 which intersect with a given @xmath402 eigenspace and a given @xmath403 eigenspace may be calculated by pasting together the boxes of a @xmath404 and a @xmath405 young diagram in a way that does not cause two previously symmetrized boxes ( same row ) to then be antisymmetrized ( same column ) , and vice versa . 
 for example , given the young diagrams @xmath406 we can construct the following composite diagrams @xmath407 writing @xmath408 and @xmath409 , and replacing each casimir operator in eq . 
 ( [ eq : casimir ] ) with its its eigenvalue given by eq . 
 ( [ eigenvalue ] ) , we find that the sum of the first terms of the eigenvalues cancels with @xmath410 , leaving @xmath411 thus , we have a prescription for calculating the eigenvalues of @xmath261 . in particular , we obtain the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath261 by constructing the optimal set of three young diagrams , as exploited in the following :      all that is necessary is to use eq . 
 ( [ eq : cassumeig ] ) to obtain the largest eigenvalue of @xmath413 . 
 the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath413 is realized by the following gluing of the @xmath52 and @xmath3-box young diagrams              the values of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 here are @xmath415 , @xmath416 , @xmath417 , and @xmath418 , which allow us to compute the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath413 , @xmath419 therefore , the desired conclusion follows .",0.219105363254741,0.10478359908883801,0.56461501121521,0.28438238879292405,0.08910891089108901,0.5769465565681451,0.22869436483441102,0.130801687763713,0.5464038252830501,0
66,"landau s theory of fermi liquids has proven tremendously successful at describing a wide range of systems of interacting fermions . 
 in particular , the theory legitimizes the free electron model by casting fermionic systems in terms of weakly - interacting quasiparticles . 
 systems of electrons in 1d provide an intriguing example of departure from the landau fermi liquid paradigm , exhibiting non - fermi - liquid behavior for any finite strength of the electron - electron interaction.@xcite perhaps the simplest model of electrons in one dimension is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) , which comprises electrons on a uniform positively - charged background.@xcite    the strong correlation occurring in 1d ensures that the excitations are not electron - like quasiparticles , but are instead collective in nature . 
 an appropriate description of the low - energy spectrum of the 1d heg comes from the theory of tomonaga and luttinger.@xcite there are several experimental signatures of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid which distinguish it from the normal fermi liquid ; these are largely accessible to transport and tunneling experiments . for example , the conductivity of a 1d channel as a function of the temperature is expected to vary logarithmically in the presence of weak disorder for the fermi liquid , and as a power law for the tl liquid.@xcite analogous relations hold for the differential conductivity and the optical conductivity . 
 also associated with the lack of quasiparticles in the tl liquid is spin - charge separation , whereby spin and charge excitations propagate at different characteristic velocities.@xcite    one - dimensional models are easy to envisage , but experimental observation of 1d behavior is potentially problematic . 
 low - dimensional systems are never entirely independent of their 3d environment , leading to effects which have the potential to obscure the 1d behavior . 
 furthermore , the presence of impurities has been shown to alter drastically the behavior of a tl liquid.@xcite however , even in manifestly 3d systems , behavior unambiguously characteristic of electrons in 1d arises surprisingly frequently . 
 features associated with the luttinger model have been observed in organic conductors ( e.g. , tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane and the bechgaard salts),@xcite transition metal oxides,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite edge states in quantum hall liquids,@xcite semiconductor heterostructures,@xcite confined atomic gases,@xcite and atomic nanowires.@xcite theoretical work on electrons in 1d thus has a large region of potential applicability . 
 the exactly - solvable luttinger model describes electrons moving in one dimension with short - range interactions and linear dispersion . 
 studies with long - range interactions have found that the exponents and excitation velocities are nontrivially altered.@xcite one thus expects to be able to describe the 1d heg within the luttinger model framework , but the exact behavior of the parameters of the model is largely unclear . 
 the interactions that we study here are long - ranged , possessing a @xmath1 coulombic tail . 
 this is most applicable to systems where screening is a small effect , such as isolated metallic carbon nanotubes and semiconductor structures where there is negligible coupling to the substrate . 
 the 1d heg has been studied with a variety of theoretical and computational approaches . 
 the principal distinction between various studies is the choice of electron - electron interaction . 
 the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath1 , which describes an infinitely - thin wire , is perhaps conceptually the simplest choice , although it is largely avoided in the literature@xcite in its original form due to the divergence at @xmath2 . instead 
 , many previous authors have removed the singularity while retaining the long - range behavior by investigating interaction potentials of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a parameter related to the width of the wire . 
 this interaction has been studied analytically@xcite and numerically.@xcite    otherwise , one can derive an effective 1d interaction by factorizing the wave function into longitudinal and transverse parts and assuming that the transverse component is the ( 2d ) single - particle ground state of the confining potential . 
 the 1d interaction is then the matrix element of the 3d coulomb interaction with respect to the transverse eigenfunctions.@xcite an example of this is the harmonic wire , in which the transverse confinement is provided by a parabolic potential , leading to a gaussian density profile in the transverse plane . 
 the harmonic wire has been studied with quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite variants of the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander approach,@xcite and the fermi hypernetted - chain approximation.@xcite    we have studied both the infinitely - thin wire and the harmonic wire using qmc . in this article 
 we report qmc calculations of the momentum density ( md ) , energy , pair - correlation function ( pcf ) , and static structure factor ( ssf ) of the infinitely - thin wire at a variety of densities and system sizes . 
 the md results in particular show the non - fermi - liquid character of the system and allow us to recover one of the tl parameters . 
 the total energy data that we provide are exact and may be regarded as a benchmark for future work . 
 we also present calculations of the md for the harmonic wire , again extracting one of the tl parameters . 
 the rest of this paper is structured as follows : the models for which we perform our calculations are described in sec . 
 [ sec : models ] . in sec.[qmc_details ] we outline qmc methods and provide the details of our approach . 
 we report the ground state energies of both models in sec.[sec : energies ] and describe the pcfs in sec .  [ 
 sec : pcf ] . in sec.[sec : ssf ] we give the ssfs that we find for the infinitely - thin wire and in sec . 
 [ sec : md ] we give the mds for both models . 
 we describe the procedure for estimating a parameter of the tl model in sec.[sec : ll_params ] . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec.[sec : conclusions ] . 
 we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath5 ) throughout this article . 
 the hamiltonians for both of the models we have studied may be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the madelung energy ( the interaction of a particle with its own background and periodic images ) , @xmath8 is the distance between electron @xmath9 and electron @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the ewald interaction ; this is the interaction of an electron at @xmath12 with another electron at @xmath13 , all of electron @xmath10 s periodic images , and @xmath14-th of the uniform positive background . 
 the two models that we have studied differ in the @xmath11 and @xmath7 terms . 
 the ewald interaction for the infinitely - thin wire may be written @xmath15 which is calculated in practice using an accurate approximation based on the euler - maclaurin summation formula ; see eq . 
 ( 4.8 ) of ref . for details . 
 the interaction of eq .  ( [ eq : inf_thin_int ] ) diverges as @xmath16 when @xmath17 . in higher dimensions , 
 the divergence in the interaction energy is canceled by an equal and opposite divergence in the kinetic energy , so that nodes do not necessarily occur where two antiparallel spins occupy the same position.@xcite in the infinitely - thin 1d system , the curvature of the wave function is unable to compensate for the divergence in the interaction potential , so the trial wave function has nodes at all of the coalescence points for both parallel and antiparallel spin pairs . 
 the result is that the ground state energy is independent of the spin - polarization and depends only on the density . in other words 
 , the lieb - mattis theorem@xcite does not apply and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states are degenerate for the interaction of eq.([eq : inf_thin_int ] ) . 
 we have examined only the fully spin - polarized case for the infinitely - thin wire . 
 the second model we have studied describes electrons in a 2d confinement potential given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the width parameter and @xmath20 is the magnitude of the projection of the electron position onto the plane perpendicular to the axis of the wire . 
 the ewald - like interaction for this model may be written as@xcite @xmath21\cos(gnx_{ij } ) \ ; , \label{eq : ewald_like_sum}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath22 . 
 equation ( [ eq : ewald_like_sum ] ) possesses a long - range coulomb tail and is finite at @xmath23 . a derivation of eq . 
 ( [ eq : ewald_like_sum ] ) is given in appendix [ app : ewald ] . 
 for the harmonic wire we have probed different polarizations , @xmath24 . 
 we computed expectation values using the variational and diffusion monte carlo ( vmc and dmc , respectively ) methods as implemented in the casino program.@xcite for the infinitely - thin wire , we combined vmc and dmc results to form extrapolated estimates@xcite where applicable , whereas for the harmonic wire we used vmc alone .    in the vmc method the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to a trial wave function is calculated using a stochastic integration technique.@xcite trial wave functions usually contain a number of free parameters ; we optimized the free parameters in our wave function by unreweighted variance minimization@xcite and linear - least - squares energy minimization.@xcite dmc is a stochastic projector technique for solving the many - body schrdinger equation and generates configurations distributed according to the product of the trial wave function and its ground state component.@xcite dmc calculations of expectation values of operators that commute with the hamiltonian are in principle exact for systems in which the wave function nodes are known ; this is the case for both the infinitely - thin and harmonic wires . 
 we used a slater - jastrow wave function for both systems , where the jastrow factor comprised two - body terms consisting of smoothly truncated polynomials and a sum of cosines with periodicity commensurate with that of the simulation cell.@xcite the orbitals in the slater determinant were plane waves with wave vectors up to @xmath25 for the paramagnetic systems and @xmath26 for the ferromagnetic systems . 
 the orbitals were evaluated at quasiparticle coordinates related to the actual coordinates by a backflow transformation.@xcite backflow provides an efficient way of describing three - body correlations in the 1d heg , but leaves the exact nodal surface unchanged . 
 one method for assessing the wave function quality is to examine the fraction of the correlation energy retrieved , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hartree - fock energy , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dmc and vmc energies , respectively . 
 we tested several types of wave function for the infinitely - thin wire with @xmath31 a.u . 
 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ; our vmc calculations retrieved @xmath34 of the correlation energy when we used a two - body jastrow factor and backflow transformations [ the error bars were @xmath35 a.u . ] , which is the type of wave function we use throughout this paper . while it is indeed the case that dmc is formally exact for the 1d heg , the quality of the trial wave function is important for the statistical efficiency of the dmc method and the accuracy with which expectation values of operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian may be computed 
 .      the dmc energy did not change beyond statistical error upon varying the number of walkers between 640 and 2000 , so we used @xmath37 walkers in our calculations and assumed that population control bias is negligible . 
 the dependence of the energy upon the dmc timestep @xmath38 was also investigated ; fig . 
 [ fig : dtdmc ] shows that for small @xmath38 the energy is constant . 
 we performed our calculations at a single timestep given by @xmath39 . 
 this fairly conservative choice was made to ensure that time step bias is entirely negligible . 
 the rms distance diffused by each electron in a single step was thus slightly less than @xmath40 . 
 for the infinitely - thin wire , we used simulation cells containing 37 , 55 , 73 , and 99 particles subject to periodic boundary conditions for our calculations of the energy , pcf , and ssf . 
 our md calculations for the infinitely - thin wire also used a much larger cell with @xmath41 . for the harmonic wire , we used cells with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and occasionally @xmath44 for the @xmath33 systems and cells with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath47 systems . 
 previous work encountered difficulties in sampling different spin configurations of the harmonic wire for @xmath48 due to the presence of `` pseudonodes '' at the antiparallel coalescence points,@xcite although these problems were largely overcome by the use of lattice - regularized diffusion monte carlo ( lrdmc ) in ref .. the problem occurred because for strong , repulsive interactions the wave function can become small when two antiparallel spins approach one another . combined with a small time step this can lead to simulations where opposite spins exchange positions infrequently and the space of spin configurations is explored very inefficiently . 
 use of a small time step is a necessary part of the algorithm of projector methods like dmc . 
 we have avoided ergodicity problems by using vmc to study the harmonic wire ; in the vmc method there is no restriction other than ergodicity on the transition probability density and one may propose moves however one wishes provided that the acceptance probability is modified accordingly . 
 we use electron - by - electron sampling with the transition probability density given by a gaussian centered on the initial electron position . 
 the vmc `` time step '' in fact bears no relation to real time and is simply the variance of the transition probability density . in practice , 
 the unmodified time steps ( chosen to achieve a @xmath49 acceptance ratio ) used in vmc are usually large enough to eliminate ergodicity problems , although we found some cases where it was necessary to enforce a lower limit on the width of the transition probability density . 
 table [ table : spinexchange ] shows the frequency with which electrons changed positions in our simulations for both high and low density systems with strong and weak confinement . 
 .frequency with which electrons paths cross in our vmc simulations of the harmonic wire . 
 the quantity @xmath50 is the proportion of proposed single - electron moves that result in a change in the ordering of the particles . 
 a typical calculation comprises between @xmath51 and @xmath52 proposed single - electron moves . 
 the data shown are for @xmath45 .

67,"the density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) , developed by white in 1992 @xcite , is one of the most precise numerical algorithms for the investigation of low - dimensional strongly correlated systems . 
 originally the dmrg was introduced to compute the ground state and low energy spectrum of a quantum hamiltonian @xmath1 . 
 meanwhile there are a number of variants using the basic dmrg idea of numerical renormalisation in other physical fields @xcite . 
 an important progress was made by applying the dmrg to the transfer - matrix of 2d classical systems @xcite , a method known as transfer - matrix dmrg ( tmrg ) . 
 this even allows to analyse the thermodynamics of 1d quantum systems @xcite by mapping the partition function to a 2d classical model using a trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite . 
 a highly efficient realisation of a tmrg algorithm , which uses corner - transfer - matrices ( ctms ) , was proposed in @xcite and is called corner - transfer - matrix dmrg ( ctmrg ) . 
 an upcoming new application field of the dmrg algorithm are 1d stochastic systems . 
 the dynamics of such models are described by a master equation which has the form of a schrdinger equation with a `` stochastic '' hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite . 
 the dmrg algorithm can be used to compute the stationary limit of the stochastic process , which corresponds to the ground state of @xmath1 . 
 in contrast to quantum systems @xmath1 is in general not hermitian since there is genuinely no detailed balance . 
 carlon @xcite first applied the stochastic dmrg algorithm to various reaction - diffusion models and discussed in detail the influence of non - hermitian operators on the numerics . 
 an alternative approach to stochastic models using a tmrg algorithm was proposed in @xcite . in complete analogy to quantum systems the dynamics of 1d stochastic models can be mapped to a 2d classical model . 
 therefore it was quite natural to apply the tmrg to the corresponding `` stochastic '' transfer - matrix . even though this so - called stochastic 
 tmrg is similar to the quantum case in many respects , some important differences appear . 
 enss and schollwck @xcite discussed in detail properties of the stochastic transfer - matrix focussing on the choice of the density - matrix . 
 unfortunately , the stochastic tmrg shows an unsatisfactory convergence caused by inherent numerical problems which are related to the structure of the stochastic transfer - matrix . 
 the present work proposes a new approach to analyse the dynamics of stochastic problems , a method which we refer to as stochastic light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) . 
 as suggested by its name , the lctmrg combines ideas of the stochastic tmrg and ctmrg algorithms , adjusted by a causality argument which demands a number of modifications for an adaption of the ctmrg to stochastic problems . 
 we show that the lctmrg is a considerable improvement of the stochastic tmrg with respect to numerical stability and performance . 
 stochastic models have gained a large interest in statistical physics . 
 they are used not only in physical but many interdisciplinary research fields to describe processes far away from thermal equilibrium @xcite . 
 the bandwidth of applications reaches from the description of social behaviour and biological processes to traffic flow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . 
 typically , stochastic models start from an initial state which evolves in time according to ( local ) probabilistic rules .    in the present work we focus on one - dimensional stochastic problems . 
 we consider a chain of length @xmath2 , where each site @xmath3 can either be occupied by a particle ( @xmath4 ) or empty ( @xmath5 ) 
 . in stochastic physics one is interested in the dynamic evolution of a probability distribution @xmath6 of states . 
 @xmath6 can be denoted as a vector @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability of finding the chain in the configuration @xmath9    depending on the type of dynamics , @xmath10 can evolve in continuous or discrete time . assuming continuous dynamics , 
 stochastic processes can be described by a master equation @xmath11 @xmath1 is called `` stochastic hamiltonian '' @xcite because has the form of a schrdinger equation in imaginary time . 
 the matrix elements are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote the probabilistic rates of the transition @xmath14 . 
 although the master equation suggests a close analogy to quantum systems , as an important difference the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath1 is in general _ not _ hermitian . 
 a formal solution of is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the initial probability distribution at @xmath17 . 
 obviously , the stationary limit @xmath18 is a ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath1 with eigenvalue 0 . 
 stochastic models can show a rich phase diagram and interesting critical phenomena @xcite . 
 the simplest situation is an absorbing phase transition @xcite into an empty state @xmath19 . introducing the occupation number operator @xmath20 of site @xmath21 , the average local density of particles @xmath22 ( with arbitrary @xmath21 due to translational invariance ) is an order parameter that distinguishes the phases : all particles can either vanish ( @xmath23 ) and the system falls into the ( absorbing ) state @xmath24 , or a certain number of particles stay `` active '' ( @xmath25 ) . in the critical region @xmath26 
 evolves according to a power law whereas a non - critical behaviour is characterized by an exponential decay : @xmath27    like quantum systems , stochastic processes show universal behaviour at criticality . the most prominent universality class , which is typical for phase transitions to an absorbing state , is the directed percolation class ( dp ) @xcite . 
 but in general non - equilibrium phase transitions are by far not so well understood as those in equilibrium physics . 
 we focus on the calculation of the dynamic evolution of the local density @xmath28 of a stochastic process in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 and assume that @xmath1 consists of local `` stochastic interactions '' @xmath30 as in the conventional quantum tmrg algorithm @xcite , the stochastic system is first mapped to a 2d statistical model by using a trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite of . 
 the resulting classical 2d lattice @xcite is shown in ( a ) which local plaquette interactions are given by @xmath31 thus , the spatial dimension @xmath2 of the stochastic process is expanded by a virtual trotter dimension @xmath32 which corresponds to the time direction and is split into ( discrete ) steps of size @xmath33 . 
 @xmath33 has to be chosen sufficiently small to obtain a good approximation of @xmath26 . 
 formally , the trotter decomposition becomes exact for @xmath34 . as we measure the local density @xmath26 at finite time @xmath35 , but in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 of the stochastic chain , the space dimension of the 2d lattice is infinite , whereas the trotter dimension is finite . 
 note that in contrast to the quantum tmrg the boundary conditions are fixed in trotter direction and given by the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath16 , cf . 
 ( a ) .    in complete analogy to the quantum case one can apply a tmrg algorithm to the 2d lattice @xcite . using column transfer - matrices , shown here pictorially for the example of ( a ) , @xmath37 the local density @xmath26 for the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 can be calculated by @xmath38 @xmath39 labels the leading right / left eigenvector of @xmath40 , having the eigenvalue 1 @xcite . 
 the stochastic tmrg algorithm is used to compute @xmath39 and @xmath41 for successively increasing trotter numbers @xmath42 . 
 unfortunately , various computations show numerical problems that limit @xmath43 @xcite , which is far from enough to compete with other methods like monte - carlo simulations ( mcs ) .    here 
 we propose a different tmrg algorithm based on corner - transfer - matrices ( ctm ) . 
 such a corner - transfer - matrix dmrg algorithm ( ctmrg ) is known to be numerical more stable and faster than tmrg @xcite . 
 before we explicitly construct these ctms for the stochastic case , we discuss some physical properties of the 2d lattice relevant for the development of the new algorithm .    due to probability conservation 
 we have @xmath44 for any state @xmath45 . 
 thus , @xmath46 trivializes by summing out the `` future '' indices , i.e.@xmath47 the effect of to the 2d lattice is discussed in detail in @xcite . for the computation of @xmath26 
 it is found that a huge number of plaquette interactions can be omitted , because they `` trivialize '' . 
 the remaining non - trivial plaquettes form a 2d lattice of _ finite _ dimension which is shown in ( b ) . 
 the trivialisation process can easily be understood by a causality argument : only a `` light - cone '' of plaquette interactions can influence the site where the local density is measured . 
 we now construct a ctmrg algorithm which genuinely fits to the triangle structure of the 2d lattice . 
 as shown in , four cuts are set to separate the lattice into four parts . 
 the cuts are somewhat native to our model , because they form the boundaries of the `` future '' and `` past light - cone '' of the center point of the triangle . 
 the four parts @xmath48 \left(c_d\right)_{n_s}^{\bar n_s}= \begin{minipage}{2.3 cm } \pandocstartinclude{cd.pstex}\pandocendinclude{input}{331}{17 } \end{minipage}&,\quad & \left(c_u\right)_{n_s}^{\bar n_s}= \begin{minipage}{2.3 cm } \pandocstartinclude{cu.pstex}\pandocendinclude{input}{335}{17 } \end{minipage}\end{aligned}\ ] ] are interpreted as ctms whereby @xmath49 and @xmath50 label block - spins . 
 we next show how these ctms can be treated within a ctmrg algorithm analogous to e.g.  @xcite 
 . however , a number of modifications are necessary to adapt the ctmrg to the light - cone of plaquettes . 
 hence , we call this ctmrg variant light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) .      in a ctmrg algorithm 
 the ctms are enlarged sequentially by adding transfer - matrices ( tms ) to each cut . 
 we first define the tms in a pictorial way @xmath51    \label{eq : trans2 }    \left(t_{lu}\right)_{n_s s}^{\bar n_s}=\hspace{-0.8 cm }    \begin{minipage}{3.5cm}\pandocstartinclude{tlu.pstex}\pandocendinclude{input}{359}{43}\end{minipage}&,\quad &     \left(t_{ru}\right)_{n_s s}^{\bar n_s}=\hspace{-0.3 cm }    \begin{minipage}{3.5cm}\pandocstartinclude{tru.pstex}\pandocendinclude{input}{361}{43}\end{minipage}\hspace{-1cm}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the bullets represent single spin sites @xmath52 and the spins @xmath53 marked with bars will become renormalized block - spins in the dmrg algorithm . 
 exemplarily , and show tms which are used to enlarge the triangle lattice of ( a ) 
 .    demonstrates graphically how the tms are used to enlarge the ctms , whereby ctms and tms are `` jointed '' by summing out the adjacent indices ( similar to a matrix multiplication ) . due to the exotic geometry of the lattice we have to distinguish between an upper and lower extension step depending on whether @xmath54 or @xmath55 should be enlarged .    in our lctmrg algorithm 
 both extension steps are implemented alternately . that way all ctms grow step by step with the crossing point of the cuts always situated in the center of the triangle . 
 after each extension step the ctms have to be renormalized by a density - matrix projection , cf .  . 
 the local density @xmath56 can be obtained using @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 it is important to notice that @xmath26 is computed in the center of the triangle - lattice . here 
 , influences of boundary effects are expected to be smallest . in terms of a dmrg algorithm , the ctms @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath54 act as an `` environment '' of the `` system '' @xmath55 . 
 the key problem is to find a reasonable density - matrix projection for the renormalization of the ctms after each extension step . 
 we exemplify the construction of the density - matrix by looking at ( a ) . here 
 , one block - spin and two spins of @xmath62 and @xmath61 have to be renormalized into one block - spin . 
 the construction of the optimal density - matrix projection is now discussed in detail . 
 first , we define four vectors : @xmath63 the block - spin @xmath64 belongs to the environment , @xmath65 and @xmath49 to the system block . 
 note that these vectors approximate the left and right eigenvector of the leading eigenvalue of diagonal tms @xmath66 which have a different shape compared to the stochastic tms used in the stochastic tmrg @xcite . 
 as @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) have not to be computed by any expensive diagonalization routine like in tmrg , the lctmrg algorithm is much faster . 
 @xmath67 and @xmath68 are used to construct a reduced density - matrix for each of the two cuts . 
 the most generic choice would be a symmetric density - matrix @xmath70 } = \tr_{\bar n_s }    \left({\ensuremath{\big|\psi_l^x\big>}}{\ensuremath{\big<\psi_l^x\big|}}+{\ensuremath{\big|\psi_r^x\big>}}{\ensuremath{\big<\psi_r^x\big| } }    \right)\ ] ] which was also used in @xcite . here 
 @xmath71 denotes the partial trace over @xmath72 . 
 @xmath73}$ ] produces a reduced system block basis which optimally approximates @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite . 
 however , one can easily proof that @xmath75 is trivially given by @xmath76 which follows directly from the trivialization process . 
 obviously @xmath75 is not very useful for constructing a density - matrix , because @xmath77 reduces to a trivial projector which does not correlate system and environment block . 
 hence , we omitted @xmath75 and tested the density - matrix @xmath78 } = \tr_{\bar n_s } { \ensuremath{\big|\psi_l^x\big > } } { \ensuremath{\big<\psi_l^x\big|}}\ ] ] which led to much better results ( cf .  ) . 
 an asymmetric choice @xmath79 } = \tr_{\bar n_s } { \ensuremath{\big|\psi_r^x\big > } } { \ensuremath{\big<\psi_l^x\big|}}\ ] ] of the density - matrix performs worst . as @xmath80}{\ensuremath{\big|n_s , s_1,s_2\big > } } = \sum_{\bar n_s }    \left(\psi_l^x\right)_{n_s , s_1,s_2}^{\bar n_s}\ ] ] is independent of @xmath81 , the density - matrix @xmath82}$ ] has rank one and represents a pure projector . 
 a physical explanation for the choice of @xmath83}$ ] can be given in terms of the light - cone picture of . 
 the trivial vector @xmath84 is a superposition of all feasible states which means that at each cut no further information about the `` future '' is available . 
 not surprisingly , the system and environmental part of the cut are uncorrelated which is expressed by a trivial density - matrix projection of @xmath85 . 
 only the physics of the past , the information of which is carried by @xmath86 , correlate system and environment indices . 
 we briefly discuss some implementation details of the lctmrg algorithm . 
 the first tmrg step should start with the following configuration    of transfer - matrices . 
 this corresponds to the time @xmath87 and is the simplest construction of initial ctms and tms . the first extension steps ( cf .  ) 
 are performed without renormalisation until the dimension of the ctms exceeds the number @xmath88 of dmrg states . 
 as the transfer - matrix @xmath54 is only used for the construction of @xmath75 , which is not needed for computing @xmath89}_x$ ] , @xmath54 can be omitted completely . 
 if additionally the local hamiltonian @xmath90 is parity invariant , i.e.  @xmath91 , the local transfer - matrix @xmath46 becomes symmetric . 
 hence , only the ctms @xmath92 and tms @xmath93 have to be stored . @xmath94 and 
 @xmath95 can be reconstructed by mirroring @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    in order to avoid floating point overflows of the algorithm , 
 it is recommended to rescale all ctms and tms @xmath98 where @xmath99 is some norm . 
 note that these rescaling factors have to be considered in the computation of @xmath26 . 
 all computations were done on sun workstations ( ultra sparc iii , 900 mhz ) . 
 compared to the old stochastic tmrg @xcite the lctmrg algorithm is tremendously more efficient . 
 furthermore , as most parts of the program consist of matrix multiplications of ctms and tms , the lctmrg algorithm can easily be parallized . 
 the cpu time needed for one trotter step ranges from a few milliseconds for @xmath100 states up to a couple of seconds for @xmath101 states . 
 the consumption of computer memory is modest as well , e.g.  10 mb for @xmath100 up to 200 mb for @xmath101 . 
 the numerical studies of the present work focus on reaction - diffusion processes ( rdp ) which are used to model various chemical reactions . we consider a simple rdp with one type of particle @xmath102 which exhibits the following reactions @xmath103 this rdp can be expressed by a stochastic hamiltonian @xmath104 with local interactions @xmath105 @xmath90 is parity invariant and the local transfer - matrix @xmath46 becomes symmetric . 
 therefore the lctmrg algorithm simplifies , cf ..    as an example , we apply the new lctmrg algorithm to two rdps , the diffusion - annihilation process and the branch - fusion process . 
 these models have also been chosen by carlon @xcite to demonstrate the efficiency of the stochastic dmrg algorithm .    the diffusion - annihilation process ( dap ) @xmath106 is exactly solvable @xcite . for an unbiased initial probability distribution the dynamic evolution of the local density 
 is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 are modified bessel functions . 
 thus we can use analytical results to check the numerical precision of the tmrg data . 
 note that the dap is critical for all @xmath109 with an asymptotic behaviour @xmath110 . 
 the branch - fusion process ( bfp ) @xmath111 is a simple one parameter model which exhibits a non - equilibrium phase transition from an active to an absorbing phase . 
 the bfp is not exactly solvable , but monte - carlo - simulations and stochastic dmrg computations @xcite are available . 
 the critical behaviour of the bfp falls into the dp universality class where precise data for the critical exponents have been calculated by series expansions @xcite . 
 using the stochastic lctmrg for both models can demonstrate , whether the method is capable to produce reliable results for    * critical and non - critical systems * systems at phase transition points .    the next subsections present numerical results for the two processes . 
 if not stated differently , all computations were performed with @xmath112 . 
 ( left ) compares lctmrg calculations with exact data for @xmath113 , keeping various numbers of states @xmath88 . 
 up to more than @xmath114 trotter steps we obtain highly precise data with a deviation of less than @xmath115 from the exact results . 
 the inset of ( left ) plots the lctmrg data in a double - logarithmic plot , which shows that @xmath26 falls of algebraically . 
 the high number of trotter steps @xmath42 is a considerable improvement to the old stochastic tmrg algorithm @xcite by at least _ three _ orders . even though the dap is critical 
 , we observe an extremely stable convergence of the lctmrg algorithm . 
 ( right ) plots numerical data for different density - matrices @xmath116}$ ] and @xmath89}$ ] , cf .  . 
 in all our calculations we observe highly instable numerics , if the conventional density - matrix @xmath116}$ ] is used . in the example of 
 the convergence of the algorithm breaks down after @xmath117 trotter steps , while @xmath114 is possible for @xmath89}$ ] . 
 thus the arguments given in can be confirmed numerically : @xmath116}$ ] is not an adequate density - matrix for the stochastic lctmrg .      in this section 
 we focus on the critical phase transition of the bfp at @xmath118 @xcite . 
 ( left ) compares numerical data computed by the lctmrg algorithm with conventional monte - carlo simulations .    for @xmath119 sufficiently far away from criticality 
 , we observe a convergence up to more than @xmath120 trotter steps . in the vicinity of the critical point 
 @xmath121 the convergence becomes worse . 
 ( right ) plots the logarithmic derivative @xmath122 at the critical point @xmath121 for @xmath101 states , which is very sensitive to numerical errors . 
 up to more than @xmath123 trotter steps the numerics are extremely precise , and one can verify that @xmath26 switches to an algebraic behaviour . 
 it is also possible to determine the critical exponent @xmath124 by extrapolating @xmath125 , cf . 
 inset of ( right ) . 
 thereby , we were able to compute @xmath124 up to a precision of less than 0.1% : @xmath126    the question arises why the convergence of the lctmrg at @xmath121 is two orders less than in the dap process , yet both models behave critical . 
 we checked various numerical aspects to determine the origin of the worse convergence . 
 in the bfp it is conspicuous that the quality of the results at @xmath121 strongly depends of the number of states @xmath88 that are retained within the lctmrg algorithm . 
 this is demonstrated in ( left ) which plots numerical computations for various @xmath88 at @xmath121 .    however , it is surprising that so many states @xmath88 are needed although there is a very strong fall off of the density - matrix eigenvalues @xmath127 , cf . 
 ( right ) . 
 as another possibility we check the influence of the size of the trotter steps @xmath33 on the numerics . 
 the curves of ( left ) belong to various @xmath33 , but are rescaled to @xmath112 for comparison . 
 even though finer trotter decompositions increase the total number of convergent trotter steps , one can not improve the accuracy of the data with respect to the absolute time @xmath35 . 
 if on the other hand @xmath33 becomes too large , the trotter decomposition itself gets worse and is then responsible for unsatisfactory numerical data .    to estimate the effect of numerical errors caused by floating point inaccuracies we implemented the diagonalization routine for the density - matrix alternatively by using higher mantissa bits . 
 this was technically realized by using the gmp library @xcite which allows an arbitrary number of mantissa bits . as shown in ( right ) , only a marginal effect on the numerics is observed . 
 overall , it remains an open question what exactly is the limiting factor for the worse convergence at the phase transition point @xmath121 in the bfp . to exclude model specific reasons 
 , we also checked other rdps , e.g.  the contact process . 
 qualitatively , the same limited convergence near the critical phase transition point is observed . 
 in the present work we proposed a new variant of the stochastic tmrg by using corner - transfer - matrices which we call stochastic light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) . 
 the lctmrg algorithm fits genuinely to the specific structure of the triangle classical lattice which evolves from the trotter - suzuki decomposition of the stochastic model . 
 we tested the new algorithm by comparing lctmrg data to exact results and monte - carlo simulations of two different reaction - diffusion models . 
 we obtained highly precise numerical results ( @xmath128 ) up to @xmath129 trotter steps , even if the model behaves critical as the diffusion - annihilation process . 
 compared to the old stochastic tmrg algorithm @xcite with @xmath43 , this is an enormous increase of the number of reachable trotter steps of three orders . 
 an important observation is that inherent numerical problems of the old stochastic tmrg algorithm do obviously not appear in our new approach . in the vicinity of a critical phase transition point , exemplified by the branch - fusion model 
 , the convergence gets worse , but is nevertheless sufficient to determine precise results for critical exponents . 
 since _ within _ critical phases a much better convergence has been observed , it remains an open question what exactly causes the reduced convergence at critical phase _ 
 boundaries _ , which presumably does not originate from purely numerical reasons . therefore our future research is concentrated on further modifications and improvements of the lctmrg algorithm , e.g.  the implementation of a finite size algorithm . 
 overall the numerical investigations show that the new lctmrg algorithm is a considerable step towards a general and very efficient method for 1d stochastic problems . 
 compared to the traditional approach using monte - carlo simulations , there are two fundamental advantages of the lctmrg :    * the lctmrg is not a simulation technique . 
 there is no need of taking random numbers and sample averages . 
 the lctmrg is a numerical renormalisation group based on the quantum formalism for stochastic models where averages are directly accessible . * 
 the algorithm describes the _ exact _ thermodynamic limit @xmath29 of the stochastic model . 
 note that here we even have to deal with a _ finite _ 
 classical 2d system only , due to the simplification from the `` light - cone decoupling '' . 
 thus , there are in principle no finite - size effects like in mcs or stochastic dmrg 
 .    even if the number of possible time steps , in particular at phase transition points , can not compete with mcs up to now , we believe that stochastic tmrg algorithms can be an extremely valuable tool for studying 1d stochastic systems . 
 finally we mention , that  as in the case of the ctmrg @xcite  a generalisation of the lctmrg to more than one dimension is also imaginable .

68,"when a photoexcited molecule is placed in a polarizable solvent , it will relax its energy in presence of potentially strong interactions with its bath , i.e. , its nearest neighbor solvent molecules . 
 this interplay manifests itself already in the properties of the steady state by the observed stokes shift between the absorption and emission energies of the solute , which typically reflect the rearrangement of the caging solvent around the excited solute @xcite . a pioneering femtosecond transient absorption laser study of photoexcited no in solid ne and ar rare gas matrices was capable of extracting mechanistic movements of the caging rare gas atoms in combination with model calculations @xcite , but in liquid media this connection to the actual solvent movements in response to the creation of an excited state dipole moment is inherently difficult to observe experimentally . 
 quantum chemical calculations have meanwhile advanced and now permit simulating the dynamic response inside a box containing the excited molecule itself and a certain number of moving solvent molecules . in this way , simple ions @xcite , but also more complex molecules , such as aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 could be treated@xcite . in a recent experiment , 
 haldrup _ et al . 
 _ have attempted to tackle this phenomenon exploiting combined x - ray spectroscopies and scattering tools @xcite . 
 this picosecond time - resolved experiment used x - ray absorption spectroscopy to unravel the electronic changes visible around the fe @xmath2 absorption edge . 
 they occur concomitant to the geometric structural changes already extracted from the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) region @xcite . 
 the latter monitors the molecular changes around the central fe atom . 
 while these studies only shed light on the excited molecular dynamics within itself , the recent study combined x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) with x - ray diffuse scattering ( xds ) to obtain a picture of the internal electronic and structural dynamics ( via xes ) simultaneously with the geometric structural changes in the caging solvent shell . one surprising result from this experimental campaign 
 has yielded information about a density increase right after photoexcitation ( i.e. , within the 100 ps time resolution of that study ) , which was fully in line with the md simulations of ref .  . 
 they calculated a change in the solvation shell between the low spin ( ls ) ground and high spin ( hs ) excited state , which resulted in the expulsion of  on average  two water molecules from the solvation shell into the bulk solvent . 
 this showed up in the xds data as a density increase in the transient xds pattern , and even the quantitative analysis extracted an average density increase due to about two water molecules expelled into the bulk solvent per photoexcited [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 . 
 this success has triggered the current theoretical study : if it is becoming possible to experimentally gain new insight into guest - host interactions in disordered systems like aqueous solutions , would it be possible to eventually understand the influence of guest - host interactions on the dynamic processes occurring within the solute ? indeed , 
 aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 is an ideal model system for several reasons . 
 internally , it undergoes several ultrafast transition processes involving correlations within the @xmath3 orbitals : after photoexcitation from the @xmath4a@xmath5 ground state into its singlet excited metal - to - ligand charge transfer state ( @xmath4mlct ) , it rapidly undergoes an intersystem crossing into the triplet manifold ( @xmath6mlct ) within about 30 fs @xcite , and leaves the mlct manifold in 120 fs @xcite . 
 femtosecond xas studies observed the appearance of the finally accessed hs @xmath7t@xmath8 state in less than 250 fs @xcite , which was also confirmed by an ultrafast optical - uv transient absorption study @xcite . 
 a very recent femtosecond xes study revealed the existence of a metal - centered intermediate electronic state on the fly before the system settles into the hs state @xcite . 
 this electronic and spin - switching process sequence starts from the ls ground state which is formed by six paired electrons in the lower t@xmath9 level . 
 then , the cascade proceeds to the hs excited state . there , the six electrons are distributed via t@xmath10e@xmath11 and both e@xmath11 electrons with parallel spins to two of the four t@xmath10 electrons . 
 overall , @xmath12 in the hs state ( against @xmath13 in the ground state ) results . 
 such a transition is very common in fe - ii based spin crossover ( sco ) compounds , but little is understood about both the internal dynamic processes involved as well as about the possible influence of the solvent on this rapid spin - switching scheme . 
 indeed , the initially excited mlct manifold should interact with the caging solvent molecules , but currently little is known about the actual dynamic processes . 
 this mystery motivates the calculations performed in this work . 
 here we investigate the energy relaxation dynamics in photoexcited aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 theoretically in order to provide a new view of the short - time guest - host interactions in this complex sequence of relaxation . 
 the water molecules close to the compound are polarized and a hydration shell of bound water is formed . on the one hand , this hydration shell may shield the complex from polarization fluctuations provided by the bulk water . on the other hand 
 , it may also act as an additional source of polarization fluctuations and thus enhance the relaxation process . to be specific here 
 , we consider the case of [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 in water @xcite . 
 the set of states which are involved in the cascade of transitions from the ls to the hs state is schematically shown in fig . 
 also , several intermediate vibronic states of the complex are relevant @xcite . 
 an initial photoexcitation ( green solid arrow ) brings the fe - ii complex from the ground state of the ls configuration into an excited vibronic state of a configuration of the metal - to - ligand - charge - transfer ( mlct ) state . 
 the photoexcitation at @xmath14 nm provides an energy of about @xmath15 ev or @xmath16 @xmath17 . 
 more precisely , a state on the @xmath4mlct manifold is initially excited , but rapidly undergoes an intersystem crossing into the triplet manifold ( @xmath6mlct ) within about 30 fs @xcite . 
 the two manifolds are similar in their vibrational frequencies and correspond to the skeleton mode of bpy in the mlct configuration . 
 this mode has a rather high vibrational frequency of @xmath18 @xmath17and its vibrational ground state has an energy of about @xmath19 @xmath17 . 
 hence , the photoexcitation populates mostly the vibrational state @xmath20 with a quantum number @xmath21 . 
 the relaxation out of this state can now occur via two alternative relaxation pathways . 
 elements of these pathways are known , but the path which is eventually chosen by the system is not fully understood in detail up to present . on the one hand , the relaxation can proceed via energetically lower - lying vibrational states on the mlct manifold , i.e. , following @xmath22 ( the blue path , see the sequence of blue arrows in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . 
 in fact , the available mlct states form a broad manifold of metal - centered states @xcite . from the mlct ground state , the energy 
 could be transferred to a vibrationally excited state of one of the metal - centered triplet states ( @xmath23 t ) . in the t state , 
 the fe - n bond length increases , such that the fe - ii complex expands by about @xmath24  . 
 this molecular configuration has a vibrational energy gap @xcite of @xmath25 @xmath17which corresponds to a vibrational mode of the fe - n bond . 
 it is experimentally well - established that the transfer from the mlct manifold to the intermediate t states occurs in about @xmath26 fs . 
 the system would reach the vibrational ground state of the t configuration via a sequence of vibrational relaxation steps . from the t - vibrational ground state , the energy 
 would be transferred to a vibrational excited state of the hs configuration . 
 its hs vibrational ground state has an energy of @xmath27 @xmath17 . 
 the vibrational energy gap is again determined by a vibrational mode of the fe - n bond and is estimated @xcite as @xmath28 @xmath17 . 
 it is established that the transfer from the t to the hs state occurs within @xmath29 fs @xcite . along with this 
 occurs another rearrangement of the compound which results in an effective growth of the molecule ( and thus somewhat the caging cluster ) of @xmath30  . 
 after vibrational relaxation in the hs state , the system would reach its hs ground state configuration within @xmath31 fs @xcite . 
 the second possible pathway ( the red path , see the sequence of red arrows in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] ) would start in a highly excited vibrational state on the mlct manifold as before . without performing a vibrational relaxation transition within the mlct manifold 
 , it directly yields to a highly excited vibrational state on the t manifold within @xmath26 fs and continues again without a vibrational relaxation transition to another highly excited vibrational state of the hs configuration within @xmath29 fs . 
 from there , the complex relaxes into the hs ground state via vibrational transitions and removal of the corresponding energy into the hydration shell and bulk water within @xmath31 fs @xcite .    the final hs to ls relaxation occurs in @xmath32 ps @xcite . 
 both scenarios would allow the system to reach the hs electronic manifold within roughly @xmath33 fs via several intermediate states . 
 the initial energy is intermittently stored within molecular vibrations but finally transferred out of the complex into the solvent environment . 
 the fe - ii complex expands , since the fe - n bond lengths increase , when the compound is excited from the ls to hs state . here 
 , we assume that fe - n stretching and bending modes are dominant . 
 what is unknown from the experimental perspective , is the vibrational life times of the intermediate vibrational electronic states ( blue and red question marks in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] ) . 
 for instance , if the highly excited vibrational states on the mlct manifold live long enough such that the transfer to the t - manifold can occur within @xmath26 fs , the system would most likely choose the red pathway . 
 on the other hand , if the highly excited vibrational states on the mlct manifold rapidly relax within @xmath26 fs to the mlct ground state , the system would prefer to follow the blue relaxation pathway . 
 sketch of the energies of the ls , mlct , t and the hs state ( not to scale ) . 
 the details are given in the text . 
 the two possible relaxation pathways are indicated by the sequences of the red and blue arrows . 
 the unknown life time of the vibrational states is indicated by the blue question mark and is determined in this work.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to decide this question from a theoretical point of view , we follow a simplified model description which is accurate enough such that a clear qualitative answer follows . for this 
 , we establish a model of a quantum mechanical two - state system which describes a bath - induced vibrational relaxation from an excited vibrational state to the ground state on a generic manifold . 
 we thereby model the environmental polarization fluctuations including the effects of a hydration shell in terms of a refined onsager model combined with a debye relaxation picture @xcite . 
 a crucial aspect here is that we include the bulk solvent _ and _ the hydration shell on the same footing in terms of a continuum description of environmental gaussian modes . 
 this model allows us easily to modify the radius of the solvated complex ( taken as a sphere in this work ) and the thickness of the surrounding hydration shell . within this simplified model , 
 we determine the energy relaxation rate for several representative vibrational modes including the fe - n stretching and bending modes in dependence of the fe - n bond length and the hydration shell thickness . 
 technically , we use numerically exact real - time path integral simulations on the basis of a fluctuational spectrum which is highly structured and far from being ohmic . 
 such a `` slow '' bath reflects the similar physical time scales on which the vibrational relaxation transitions within a vibrational manifold and the polarization fluctuations of the surrounding water occur . 
 the highly non - ohmic form ( see below ) of the bath spectral densities a priori calls for the use of an advanced theoretical method beyond the standard markov - approximated dynamical redfield equations . 
 sketch of continuum dielectric models for the complex - bound - water - solvent system , see text for details . 
 @xmath34 denotes the radius of the inner sphere , while @xmath35 refers to the radius of the outer sphere . 
 @xmath36 is the frequency - dependent complex dielectric function of the continuum bulk water modes . 
 @xmath37 is the frequency - dependent complex dielectric function associated with the bound water shell . 
 @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum inside the cavity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we find vibrational energy relaxation times on generic manifolds in the range of @xmath39 ps depending on the fe - n bond lengths and the hydration shell thickness . for this , we tune the vibrational frequencies which are determined by the curvature of the manifolds over a relevant parameter range . 
 we can determine the modes with fastest energy relaxation which dominates the energy relaxation dynamics of the fe - ii complex since internal energy redistribution is likely much faster . 
 most importantly , we observe that the vibrational relaxation times within a manifold are much longer than the typical time scales of a few hundred fs during which the hs state is formed . 
 two effects are competing here . 
 a complex with a smaller radius of the solvation sphere brings the environmental fluctuations spatially closer to the complex and thus results in a faster decay . 
 however , in turn , the stronger fe - n bond results in larger mode frequencies . 
 overall , the calculated life times of the vibrationally excited states in the ps regime clearly show that the vibrational life times are much longer than the complex overall needs to reach the hs state , which are less than @xmath33 fs . 
 thus , we can conclude that the energy relaxation basically occurs via the `` red pathway '' after the complex has reached the hs state and vibrationally relaxes into the ground state . 
 to determine the life time of the excited vibrational states , we formulate a minimal model in form of a quantum two - level system which is immersed in its solvent environment ( model 1 ) and is , in addition , surrounded by a hydration shell ( model 2 ) . 
 after expansion of the fe - ii complex , the stretching and bending modes @xcite involving the fe - n bond change their respective vibrational frequency . 
 we investigate their relaxation dynamics independently and use the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite as a minimal model , i.e. , @xmath40 here , the pauli matrix @xmath41 contains the ground state @xmath42 and the excited state @xmath43 between which we investigate the relaxation transitions . 
 the two states are separated in energy by the vibrational frequency @xmath44 . 
 the bath modes produce gaussian fluctuations stemming from harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath45 , the corresponding creation and destruction operators of the bath modes are denoted as @xmath46 and @xmath47 . 
 the fluctuations induce transitions in the system via the pauli matrix @xmath48 . 
 they can be characterized by a single function @xcite , the spectral density @xmath49 it provides the spectral weight contained in the fluctuations at frequency @xmath50 which are provided by a gaussian bath at thermal equilibrium at a given fixed temperature @xmath51 . 
 the correlation function of the quantum bath fluctuations @xmath52 is given by ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 \ , .\ ] ] this quantity determines the relaxation and dephasing rates @xcite . in this work , 
 we consider several representative fe - n stretching and bending modes with the frequencies @xmath55 60 , 120 , 150 , and 250 @xmath17 . 
 moreover , we use a continuum description of the solvent ( bulk ) water and the hydration shell following gilmore and mckenzie @xcite . the key quantity to characterize the environment , i.e. , the spectral distribution @xmath56 of the fluctuations , is determined in terms of the standard onsager model of polarization fluctuations of the solvent water molecules . 
 their relaxation properties are described within a debye relaxation picture @xcite . in this approach 
 , the spectral density is related to the continuum dielectric function @xmath57 of the host material .    to be more specific , 
 we consider two different situations @xcite , see fig . 
 [ fig2 ] : in model 1 , we assume that the complex with its vibrational mode is placed inside a vacuum spherical cavity of radius @xmath58 with a dielectric constant @xmath38 . 
 this is situated in a continuum of bulk water modes with a frequency - dependent complex dielectric function @xmath36 . in model 2 , we add to model 1 an outer sphere with radius @xmath59 . the shell formed by the two spheres describes the bound water or hydration shell in terms of a second frequency - dependent complex dielectric function @xmath37 . 
 this model allows us to determine the relaxation rates also for varying the radii @xmath58 and @xmath60 independently . throughout this work 
 , we set @xmath61 k.      following gilmore and mckenzie @xcite , one can calculate the reaction field by solving maxwell s equation for the particular geometry shown in fig . 
 this yields the spectral density @xmath62 with the respective transition dipole moment @xmath63 of the vibration , @xmath64 being the static dielectric constant of the bulk solvent , @xmath65 being the high - frequency dielectric constant of the bulk solvent , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the debye relaxation time of the solvent . for water , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 ps .    here , 
 we are interested in the dependence of the spectral density on the cavity volume determined by its radius @xmath34 and we thus collect all constants in a prefactor . 
 we arrive at @xmath70 with @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the typical length scale of the problem and where the now dimensionless radius @xmath73 is measured in units of @xmath72 . 
 we fix this to @xmath74 throughout this work . 
 the spectrum is purely ohmic @xcite with a cut - off frequency given by @xmath75 . for our considerations , we fix the dipole moment to a typical value of @xmath76 d @xmath77 cm . collecting all parameters 
 yields @xmath78 for bulk water .

 [ fig3 ] shows @xmath81 of model 1 for the case @xmath82 ( corresponding to @xmath79  ) . 
 maximal spectral weight is observed at roughly 70 @xmath17 . 
 hence , it is clear that the resulting bath correlation times are comparable to or exceed internal system periods . 
 this also prevents us from using a standard markov approximation a priori , since a correlated and non - markovian dynamics can in principle be expected @xcite ( see below ) . 
 we also include the hydration shell of bound water and do this by a second sphere with outer radius @xmath83 with @xmath35 being the corresponding dimensionless number . 
 we assume that the hydration shell is thin relative to the radius of the inner sphere and may then perform a taylor expansion in the relative shell thickness @xmath84 . 
 the resulting spectral density @xcite is @xmath85 with @xmath86 where @xmath37 is the complex dielectric function of the bound water layer . 
 within the debye relaxation model , we find @xmath87 with @xmath88 here , we have the static dielectric constant @xmath89 and the high - frequency dielectric constant @xmath90 of the bound water layer . from generic considerations @xcite , one may infer that the relaxation time of the bound water shell is one order of magnitude large than the solvent relaxation time , i.e. , we set @xmath91 . likewise , we know @xcite that @xmath92 . 
 moreover , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . 
 hence , we may use this and set @xmath95 to obtain @xmath96 for the parameters mentioned , we find @xmath97 .    time evolution of the population difference @xmath98 for @xmath99 @xmath17for @xmath61 k for different values @xmath84 of the shell thickness.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    fig . 
 [ fig3 ] shows @xmath100 for these parameters and for @xmath82 and @xmath80 . 
 again , maximal spectral weight is observed at roughly 70 @xmath17 . in general , the spectral weight of model 2 is higher than of model 1 . 
 this already indicates that within the continuum approach , the bound water shell acts as an additional source of fluctuations and not as a spectral filter for the continuous bulk modes . 
 hence , the calculated relaxation times for model 2 will be faster than for model 1 . 
 moreover , it is clear that the vibrational life times on the mlct manifold are much larger since there the spectral weight of the solvent environmental modes around the frequency of @xmath18 @xmath17   is strongly suppressed ( in fact , we do not consider the vibrational relaxation around this frequency in this work ) . 
 relaxation time ( color scale in ps ) of the excited vibrational state for varying radius @xmath101 with @xmath102  and for varying relative shell thickness @xmath84 for @xmath55150 @xmath17 . 
 model 1 with no hydration shell is contained via the cut along the line @xmath103.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to investigate the quantum relaxation dynamics of the two vibrational states under the influence of environmental fluctuations , we employ the numerically exact quasi - adiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) @xcite scheme which we have extended to allow treatment of multiple baths @xcite . specifically , quapi is able to treat highly structured and non - markovian baths efficiently @xcite . 
 it determines the time dependent statistical operator @xmath104 which is obtained after the harmonic bath modes have been integrated over . 
 we briefly summarize here the main ideas of this well - established method and refer to the literature for further details . 
 the algorithm is based on a symmetric trotter splitting of the short - time propagator @xmath105 for the full hamiltonian eq . 
 ( [ totham ] ) into a part depending on the system hamiltonian alone and a part involving the bath and the coupling term . 
 the short - time propagator gives the time evolution over a trotter time slice @xmath106 . 
 this splitting in discrete time steps is exact in the limit @xmath107 , i.e. , when the discrete time evolution approaches the limit of a continuous evolution . 
 for any finite time slicing , it introduces a finite trotter error which has to be eliminated by choosing @xmath106 small enough such that convergence is achieved . on the other side , 
 the environmental degrees of freedom generate correlations being non - local in time . 
 we want to avoid any markovian approximation at this point and take these correlations into account on an exact footing . 
 we may , however , use the fact that for any finite temperature , these correlations decay exponentially quickly on a time scale denoted as the memory time scale . 
 the quapi scheme now defines an object called the reduced density tensor . 
 it corresponds to an extended quantum statistical operator of the system which is nonlocal in time since it lives on this memory time window . by this 
 , one can establish an iteration scheme by disentangling the dynamics in order to extract the time evolution of this object . 
 all correlations are fully included over the finite memory time @xmath108 , but are neglected for times beyond @xmath109 . to obtain numerically exact results 
 , we have to increase accordingly the memory parameter @xmath2 until convergence is found . 
 the two strategies to achieve convergence , i.e. , minimize @xmath106 but maximize @xmath108 , are naturally counter - current , but nevertheless convergent results can be obtained in a wide range of parameters , including the cases presented in this work . 
 solid lines : cut through the 2d plot of fig .  [ fig4 ] along the lines @xmath110 and @xmath111 . 
 the dashed lines indicate the results of the vibrational life times calculated within a born - markov approximation ( see text).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    at first , we consider modes with a vibrational frequency of @xmath55150 @xmath17 . 
 we determine the difference @xmath112 $ ] of the populations of the ground and the excited states . 
 we start out from the initial preparation of the excited state , i.e. , @xmath113 . 
 [ fig3a ] shows examples of the relaxation dynamics for the environmental models 1 and 2 for different values of the shell thickness @xmath84 . 
 we mainly observe exponential relaxation on a time scale of a few picoseconds . for an increasing shell thickness , 
 a tendency towards a decaying oscillatory dynamics appears . a pronounced oscillation with a period of @xmath114 fs develops for the largest thickness considered . 
 to quantify the decay in terms of life times of the excited state , we extract from the time evolution the corresponding rate by a fit to an exponential . 
 [ fig4 ] shows the relaxation time in ps ( colour scale ) as a function of the radius @xmath34 of the complex varying it between 5 to 7   and the relative shell thickness @xmath84 varying it between 0 to 30% , which is consistent with the numerical findings of ref .  . 
 the plot shows results of both , models 1 and 2 ( model 1 corresponds to the line with @xmath103 ) . 
 the data for @xmath110 and @xmath111 are shown again in fig . 
 [ fig5 ] for better readability . 
 the calculated relaxation times or life times of the excited state vary from @xmath115 to @xmath116 ps . for a larger complex radius , the life time increases as expected since the prefactor of the spectral density decreases proportional to @xmath117 . 
 this reflects the assumption that the effective transition dipole sits in the center of the sphere and an increasing complex pushes the solvent fluctuations further away . 
 this reduces their strength due to the distance dependence of the dipolar coupling . 
 moreover , the life times decrease with increasing hydration shell thickness . 
 thus , the hydration shell does not act as a shield from bulk solvent fluctuations but acts as an additional source of fluctuations instead . 
 [ fig5 ] also shows the results of the vibrational life times calculated within a born - markov approximation @xcite . the inverse life time or the relaxation rate 
 can be obtained after expanding the transition rates in a master equation approach up to lowest order in the system - bath interaction , together with a markovian approximation of the bath - induced correlations . 
 this corresponds effectively to only including single - phonon transitions in the bath . 
 the inverse vibrational life time then follows as @xmath118 as is shown by the dashed lines in fig . 
 [ fig5 ] , significant deviations from the exact life times occur and the approximated life times are overestimated by up to @xmath119 .    next , we show the results for the calculated life times for other vibrational frequencies , i.e. , for @xmath120 , and @xmath121 @xmath17  in fig . 
 [ fig6 ] . 
 vibrational life times ( color scale in ps ) for @xmath122 @xmath17(a ) , @xmath26 @xmath17(b ) , @xmath123 @xmath17(c ) and @xmath121 @xmath17(d ) for models 1 and 2 for @xmath61 k.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    these values span the regime of the vibrational frequencies for the fe - n stretching and bending modes in the ls and hs state @xcite . 
 note that the frequencies are comparable to or larger than the frequency for which the maximal spectral weight in the environmental fluctuation spectrum occurs . 
 hence , the energy relaxation dynamics occurs in the regime in which non - markovian multi - phonon transitions already are noticeable @xcite . 
 we note that for larger values of @xmath44 , no convergent results have been achieved , which is a further strong indication of non - markovian behavior . 
 we observe that under the assumption of equal strengths of the coupling to the environmental fluctuations , all fe - n stretching and bending modes in the ls and hs state exhibit quite similar vibrational life times on the order of 5 ps . 
 the vibrational energy gap has been modified from @xmath124 to @xmath121 @xmath17and all cases show similar results . 
 an increased radius of the complex results in a larger life time since the fluctuating solvent molecules are moved further outside . 
 a finite hydration shell thickness reduces the vibrational life times noticeably . 
 our results indicate that all vibrational modes contribute similarly to the energy relaxation after initial photoexcitation . at the same time 
 , all vibrational modes live too long in order to relax the energy already in the mlct or the t state ( assuming here the vibrational modes being identical to the modes in the ls state ) . 
 hence , the energy after the photoexcitation is first rapidly transfered from a highly excited vibrational mlct state to a highly excited vibrational t state and then further to a highly excited vibrational hs state within about less than @xmath33 fs . 
 only then , the full excess energy is dissipated while the electronic subsystem is in the hs state . 
 hence , the system follows the `` red relaxation pathway '' sketched in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] . 
 energy redistribution within more molecular vibrational states is not included in our simplified model . assuming the excess energy initially equally distributed among the fe - n stretching and bending modes @xcite 
 , each mode gets roughly an excitation energy of 440 @xmath17 . 
 this implies that roughly two excitations of the mode @xmath55 250 @xmath17 and up to three or four excitations of the mode with @xmath55 120 @xmath17 and @xmath55 150 @xmath17 occur . 
 thus , the total equilibration time of the complex after photoexcitation roughly follows as three times @xmath125 ps which yields a value of @xmath126 ps . 
 these results could be experimentally verified by ultrafast spectroscopy of the intermediate mlct and t states .

69,"in condensed matter context , in experiments or related theoretical interpretations we often encounter small number of particles confined in a system or device , for example , in the case of quantum dots @xcite , quantum well structures @xcite , mesoscopic systems @xcite , experimental entanglement @xcite , micro - crystals @xcite , could gases trapped in optical lattices @xcite , optical bound states @xcite , segregation @xcite , interfacial stress and fracture @xcite , self organized structures @xcite , sintering @xcite , or compounds studied in the low concentration limit @xcite . 
 such problems , presenting both theoretical @xcite and technological @xcite interest have continuously attracted increasing attention . starting from even one electron problems solved exactly @xcite , 
 several cases of interest for two @xcite , three @xcite , four @xcite , or few @xcite particles have been studied , concentrating on the model behavior in the low concentration limit , or motivated by experimentally measured characteristics . in this hierarchy of the increasing number of carriers in the study of a given problem , 
 the particle number four ( @xmath1 ) represents a special case , since it is close to the particle number limit around which one can hope that deep rigorous descriptions can be made @xcite even in the non - integrable cases , the problem is also treatable from the numerical side as well @xcite , statistics and @xmath2 characterization can be given @xcite , and the problem retain even many - body aspects of the system s behavior @xcite . 
 the simulations on the @xmath1 particle problem started more than a decade ago @xcite , but up today , only few valuable results are known in this subject in the condensed matter context , as follows . 
 the energy dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponent has been studied for 1d lenard - jones system @xcite , the spinless fermion case has been analyzed as a simplified model for correlated electrons @xcite , the conjecture of the andreev - lifshitz supersolid has been studied @xcite , entangled states have been described in the high frequency region @xcite , doped quantum well structures have been investigated @xcite , special cases where only two pairs of particles interact on a lattice were considered @xcite , localization lengths have been estimated in 1d disordered systems @xcite , and the behavior in the presence of coulomb forces has been analyzed @xcite . as can be seen , 
 the knowledge accumulated in this direction is relatively poor . 
 approximated procedures have been applied in different conditions for different systems of interest , but the level of exact characteristics has not been reached yet .    the need to study at exact level system holding @xmath1 particles is enhanced by several motivations . 
 first of all , @xmath1 it is placed in the low density limit , and as known , in this limit , especially in low dimensions , no class of diagrams can be neglected in describing the system @xcite . given by this difficulty 
 , one often finds that traditional approximation schemes which work at higher densities , here fail @xcite or provide unphysical results @xcite . 
 secondly , we are placed in the concentration limit where the formation of fermi liquid properties can be studied @xcite , and since this parameter region is usually numerically accessible , research with analytical focus , starting from numerical results , also can be done . 
 thirdly , as several times has been accentuated @xcite , key aspects of the unapproximated descriptions are often hidden in the few particle cases . 
 the four particle case seems to be tractable also from this point of view . 
 finally , in @xmath1 case we face a situation which experimentally is produced , having potential application possibilities in several areas , as for example in the study of entangled states @xcite , non - local character of quantum theory @xcite , high precision spectroscopy @xcite , quantum communication , quantum cryptography , and quantum computation @xcite , fields where deep and high quality results are clearly demanded @xcite .    starting from the motivations presented above , we show in this paper that for the @xmath1 case , exact , analytical , and explicit results holding essential information about the system behaviour can be indeed provided , even for arbitrary large systems . to show this , we present below the exact ground state for four interacting electrons placed in an arbitrary large two leg hubbard ladder described by periodic boundary conditions . 
 this is given in conditions for which , even the known three ( quantum mechanical ) particle exact results are very rare for systems taken outside of one dimension ( see ref.[@xcite ] and the references therein ) , hence we hope that the presented results will generate creative advancements .    in order to obtain such results , a direct space representation is used for the wave functions . starting from local particle configurations , 
 symmetry adapted ortho - normalized basis wave vectors are constructed . 
 based on these , in the studied case , an explicit and analytic closed system of 9 equations is constructed , whose secular equation provides the ground state wave function and energy . deducing the ground state wave function for different microscopic parameters of the model , ground state expectation values 
 are calculated for different physical quantities of interest , and correlation functions are deduced in order to characterize the ground state properties . 
 the method which is described here is in principle not model or particle number dependent , and could be applied for other systems as well . in presenting our calculations , 
 the aim was not to hide the obtained results behind a numerical treatment or deduced symmetry properties , ( which certainly also can be done ) , but to show clear , visible , and explicit properties which , based on the provided essential characteristics , could enhance further creative thinking or applications . in order to underline the importance of these aspects we note for example , that in recent studies made for states containing 2 - 4 particles , especially in attempts to characterize the entanglement @xcite , or quantum dots @xcite , often the analysis must be made without to know the state completely @xcite . 
 we show below how such ingredients , at least at the level of the ground state , are possible to overcome . 
 the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows . 
 section ii . presents the hamiltonian , the deduction procedure and the ground state wave functions , section iii . exemplifies the physical properties of the ground state , sect . 
 iv . presents the summary and conclusions of the paper , while the appendices a - b presenting mathematical details , close the presentation . 
 the strategy which we use for presentation is the following one . 
 we have chosen a simple model which allow us to characterize the construction of exact ground states in the presence of four particles . 
 after presenting the results we indicate how the procedure could be applied for other systems as well . 
 the hamiltonian we use for presentation has the form of a standard two - leg hubbard ladder hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 creates an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 holding the index @xmath8 are nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes along and perpendicular to ladder legs , @xmath9 is the on - site coulomb interaction , and @xmath10 represents nearest - neighbor sites in @xmath11 direction taken into account in the sum over the lattice sites only once . 
 if we would like to analyze by exact diagonalization the four particle problem in the singlet case in a two leg hubbard ladder containing @xmath12 lattice sites , we must treat numerically a hilbert space of @xmath13 ^ 2 $ ] dimensions , where for example at @xmath14 we have @xmath15 , and for @xmath16 one encounters @xmath17 as @xmath18 . 
 we show below how it is possible to deduce exactly the ground state for a such type of system in the case of an arbitrary large two leg hubbard ladder based on only nine linear and analytic equations , and to extract essential information from the obtained results . in order to do this , first of all we delimit exactly the hilbert space region ( @xmath19 ) containing the ground state by the construction of nine type of orthogonal basis wave vectors spanning @xmath19 . 
 this procedure is presented below . 
 we are interested first to have an image about the possible type of states of the studied four particles in the system under consideration . to obtain such type of information , we number all lattice sites of the ladder as shown in fig.1 ( periodic boundary conditions are considered ) . in the figure , @xmath12 , 
 considered even number , denotes the number of sites within the system , while @xmath20 gives the number of rungs , respectively . 
 using now an @xmath0-space representation , one observes that since the ladder legs , and the spin reversed configurations are equivalent , the studied four particles can be placed into the system only in nine possible ways , as depicted in fig.2 . 
 the presented possibilities , denoted by capital letters @xmath21 to @xmath22 will provide nine type of basis wave vectors ( denoted by the same letters ) , whose construction is presented below . 
 we mention that the subscripts @xmath23 are denoting particle positions within the considered states @xmath21 to @xmath22 presented in fig.2 , which are such chosen , to have the first particle position placed into the origin ( e.g. lattice site 1 ) . in the following , the nine possible four - particle states presented in fig.2 will be called _ 
 generating configurations_. how one arrives from the generating configuration @xmath24 to the base vector @xmath25 , is explained in the following two subsections . 
 each generating configuration provides other seven related configurations ( brother configurations ) of the same type . 
 these are obtained by a ) rotating the generating configuration by 180 degrees along the longitudinal symmetry axis of the ladder , b ) rotating the generating configuration by 180 degrees along the symmetry axis perpendicular to the ladder , c ) rotating by 180 degrees the configuration obtained at b ) along the longitudinal symmetry axis of the ladder , and finally , d ) other four related configurations are obtained by reversing all spin orientations in the generating configuration and the configurations deduced at points a)-c ) . 
 as an example , the eight related configurations describing the state @xmath26 taken at @xmath27 , are depicted in the first column of fig.3 . 
 after this step , since all lattice sites are equivalent , the different , , related  configurations are translated by _ elementary translation _ 
 @xmath28 times along the ladder , and all the contributions are added . we obtain in this manner a sum of configurations for each generating configuration . 
 such a sum contains @xmath29 components . 
 for example , in the case of the @xmath30 state , this sum is presented in fig.3 . 
 the procedure described above must be effectuated separately for each generating configuration . as a result , we obtain at this point nine configuration sums . 
 each of these sums will give rise to one basis wave vector as follows .      a given configuration sum described in the previous subsection 
 provides one basis wave vector if each individual configuration of the sum is written in mathematical form via four creation operators acting on the bare vacuum . in order to do this 
 , we have to fix the order of creation operators for each type of contribution , which has been done as follows . for two doubly occupied sites we write the creation operators of the couples next to each other , first the spin up , then the spin down contribution , as @xmath31 , where only the restriction @xmath32 exists . in the case of basis wave vectors containing only one 
 doubly occupied site at @xmath5 one uses @xmath33 , were @xmath34 and @xmath35 must hold . 
 finally , for cases without double occupancies , the convention @xmath36 is considered , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 must hold . using these conventions , for example , in the case of @xmath39 , taken at @xmath40 and depicted in fig.3 . 
 the result becomes @xmath41 similar procedure applies for all basis wave vectors . 
 we mention that the so obtained basis wave functions are orthogonal .    here 
 we must note that because of the fixed conventions presented above , sometimes an additional negative sign arises in the process of writing the mathematical expression corresponding to a basis wave vector component translated from the end to the beginning of the ladder in the presence of the periodic boundary conditions . 
 for example , if we translate the vector @xmath42 by an elementary translation along the ladder , according to the fixed conventions one obtains @xmath43 .      after the calculation presented above , we are in the possession of nine type of orthogonal basis wave vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 . now one observes that by applying the hamiltonian on a given @xmath46 basis wave vector with fixed @xmath47 , we obtain the result inside the @xmath48 set . 
 consequently , nine explicitly given analytic linear equations form a closed system of equations , whose secular equation , by its minimum eigenvalue , contains the ground state at attractive @xmath9 . 
 the nine equations are exemplified in appendix a and are available in their complete extent in ref.[@xcite ] . 
 the ground state nature of the minimum energy eigenstate has been tested by exact numerical diagonalizations taken on the full hilbert space for different @xmath12 values . 
 the fact that the analytic solution of the problem can be given in such a manner for arbitrary large ladder length is connected to the observation that with increasing @xmath12 , the type of the particle configurations describing the system ( see fig.2 ) , remains unchanged . 
 the deduction of the ground state itself from the system of equations presented in appendix a must be numerically given @xcite . 
 since the possible inter - particle distances ( e.g. the possible values of the @xmath49 indices in @xmath50 at fixed @xmath47 ) depend on the @xmath12 value , the number of equations which must be numerically treated depends on @xmath12 in the frame of the same analytic expressions . for example , 
 for the @xmath51 case we have @xmath52 , for the @xmath53 case we have @xmath54 , etc . 
 the number of obtained equations @xmath55 is however significantly lower than @xmath56 , the @xmath57 ratio being at least of order @xmath58 at intermediate @xmath59 values . increasing @xmath12 , @xmath60 further increases . 
 in fact , the deduced system of equations , based on symmetry properties , delimitates from the full hilbert space a @xmath55 dimensional space region , inside of which the ground state is placed . 
 the deduction of a such region is possible for other ( non - disordered ) models , and other particle numbers as well . in order to do this 
 , we mention that if the lattice sites are equivalent , the elementary translation of a particle configuration can be in principle given with a site independent multiplicative phase factor @xmath61 . 
 furthermore , the rotation of a particle configuration along a symmetry axis can be given in principle with a multiplicative phase factor of the form @xmath62 , both @xmath63 providing their contributions in the basis wave vectors @xcite . 
 in the described case , we have @xmath64 , but in other cases , the energy can be minimized in function of these parameters .    in deducing the linear system of equations describing @xmath19 in a new case characterized by a new @xmath65 , one must start from a given basis wave vector ( denoted by @xmath66 , for example ) . 
 this is obtained from a generating particle configuration , which is translated and rotated as specified above , all such obtained configurations being summed up . from technical reasons , the first generating particle configuration must be such chosen to contain ( for @xmath67 spin fermions ) only double occupied sites placed in nearest neighbor sites . calculating now @xmath68 , the result becomes a linear combination containing new base vectors @xmath69 , holding the same symmetry properties , but being related to new generating configurations . 
 continuing the procedure by calculating @xmath70 , etc . 
 , since periodic boundary conditions are used , the linear system of equations closes up . 
 it is even not important to know all distinct particle configuration possibilities , since these are automatically generated by the @xmath71 operation . 
 by diagonalizing the system of equations presented in appendix a and taking the minimum energy solution , one finds the ground state wave function @xmath72 . using this 
 , the complete quantum mechanical characterization of the ground state can be given . in order to exemplify the results , we present in ( [ gs1],[gs2 ] ) explicit expressions containing the leading terms of the ground state wave function for two parameter values . 
 even appendix b shows that in the leading terms of the ground state wave function , the particles have the tendency to be placed in pairs , the pairs tending to occupy the highest possible distance between them . 
 this is reflected as well in the density - density correlation function depicted in fig.4c . 
 ground state expectation values and correlation functions are exemplified in figs . 
 4 - 5 . calculated for @xmath73 , e.g. ladder containing 14 rungs described by periodic boundary conditions taken along the ladder . 
 the correlation functions are defined as follows . 
 the density - density correlation function has the expression @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 . 
 the spin correlations are studied via @xmath77 where @xmath78 . 
 the superconducting pairing s - wave @xcite correlation function is @xmath79 and the superconducting pairing d - wave @xcite correlations are studied via @xmath80 where @xmath81 . 
 the @xmath5 in @xmath82 denotes a rung connecting the lattice sites @xmath83 . 
 the @xmath84 values inside the figures are given in lattice constant units . 
 fig.4a presents the ground state energy and the potential energy in @xmath85 units in function of @xmath86 at @xmath87 . 
 fig.4b shows that the spin - spin correlations are exponentially decreasing , the decrease rate in the @xmath88 being of the form @xmath89 . 
 the density - density correlations depicted in fig.4c show that the particles tend to occupy opposite positions in the ladder closed by periodic boundary conditions .    in fig.5 
 the behavior of the superconducting correlation functions is presented . in these plots @xmath90 holds . 
 the correlations in fig.5 are decreasing with @xmath84 , and for @xmath91-wave case slightly increase by increasing the attractive @xmath9 value . 
 fig.5c further shows that the decrease of the inter - leg hopping amplitude at fixed on - site interaction is detrimental to @xmath92-wave pairing correlations . 
 similar behavior has been found also by others @xcite . 
 we describe a procedure which allows the exact deduction of ground state wave functions for few particles in lattice models . 
 the main result of our paper is that indeed , a such type of analytic description can be done . in the case of an arbitrary large two leg hubbard ladder taken with periodic boundary conditions and containing four electrons , presented in details 
 , the method leads for the singlet state to nine analytic linear and coupled closed system of equations , whose secular equation , through its minimum eigenvalue solution , provides the ground state wave function and ground state energy . 
 the procedure is based on a @xmath0-space representation of the wave functions and properly constructed symmetry adapted orthogonal basis wave vectors . 
 these are obtained from generating particle configurations translated and rotated in the lattice and finally added . 
 the linear system of equations is obtained by applying the hamiltonian on the deduced basis wave vectors . 
 the procedure can be applied for other systems as well . 
 the fact that the analytic structure of the ground state becomes visible by the use of the method underlines that the presented procedure contributes not only to the understanding of theoretical aspects related to exact descriptions , or development possibilities of new numerical approximation schemes , but has implications on a broad spectrum of subfields related to technological developments placed in between nano - devices and quantum computation , where the exact knowledge of the behavior of a small number of quantum mechanical particles plays a main role .

70,"it is remarkable in this current generation of highly developed spacecraft exploration of the solar system that scientific ballooning still remains a powerful and effective method of particle astrophysics investigation . 
 more than a century after balloon flights were first used  @xcite to establish the extraterrestrial nature of cosmic rays , balloon - based investigations still play a crucial role in their elucidation . since the time of viktor hess initial studies , a myriad of new techniques for the study of high energy radiation from the cosmos has been developed , including sophisticated methods utilizing direct detection , cherenkov , and fluorescence radiation , observed on the ground ; and particle detection in a wide range of spacecraft . 
 however , the unique role of cosmic ray investigations from balloons has not yet been superseded , for a variety of reasons : from the relatively low cost and risk for development of new and novel instruments as balloon payloads , the large lift capacity of a balloon system for modest costs , and in some cases , due to the fact that the suborbital trajectory of the balloon system is a necessary part of the science requirements .    the term _ particle astrophysics _ was initially synonymous with cosmic ray studies , but within the last several decades it has become increasingly evident that still - undiscovered fundamental particles may play a dominant role in the composition of the non - baryonic dark matter , which makes up of order a quarter of the closure density of the universe . 
 thus the scope of particle astrophysics has expanded to include dark matter investigations , although we can not yet be certain that the dark matter will yield to a particle physics solution . 
 in addition to the study of charged particles , high energy gamma - rays , and possible neutrons of extra - solar origin , neutrinos have now also emerged as another member of the particle astrophysics panoply . 
 the fluxes of high energy neutrinos in the tev to eev range are closely coupled to cosmic acceleration processes , and may provide `` smoking - gun '' evidence for the sources of both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays . for the latter , cosmogenic eev neutrinos are direct byproducts of intergalactic scattering of the highest energy cosmic rays , and have the potential to probe cosmic ray accelerators even back to the earliest epochs of cosmic ray sources . 
 balloon - borne payloads are active contributors to all of these particle astrophysics topics . in the following report 
 , we provide a `` user s view '' of the current state - of - the - art of nasa ballooning and highlight a number of the current and planned missions . 
 while this will not be a complete review of the nasa particle astrophysics program , we hope it will provide a useful introduction to an exciting and accessible part of the nasa astrophysics program , one that is often overshadowed by spacecraft missions , but has produced a very compelling portfolio of scientific accomplishments in the last few decades . 
 before turning to the payloads themselves , we first summarize the payload and flight profile capabilities of the program .        fig . 
 [ balloonscale ] shows a graphical summary of the scale of a typical balloon in various stages of the launch and ascent to float . 
 helium initially inflates only a relatively small volume of the balloon at ground level , and the flight train is typically around 800 ft long at liftoff . 
 balloon launches and flights produce very low dynamics compared to a rocket launch , and thus payloads may dispense with the rigorous vibration qualification required of spacecraft payloads . 
 the only significant dynamic event is at termination after the flight is complete , and the parachute opens after several tens of km free fall from the float altitude ( typically 120kft ) down to about 80kft , where the atmosphere has enough density to fill the parachute . by this time 
 the payload is falling at a high velocity , and the jerk from the filling chute can produce several gees of acceleration . 
 recent modifications to the flight train using dynamic load absorbers have greatly reduced even these dynamics , but payloads are still required to be designed for a maximum 10 gee acceleration at this stage . however , the requirement is only that the payload does not separate from the flight train , and this takes place after the science mission is complete.thus the science instrument does not have to be designed to operate after this acceleration event , only to survive it in a safe - mode state .    in fig . 
 [ qual ] we show current altitude vs. lift capabilities for nasa qualified balloons . 
 these come in both zero - pressure balloons ( zpb ) , and recently now in super - pressure ( spb ) versions . 
 zpbs are vented and stay at equilibrium density / pressure with the surrounding gas at float . 
 diurnal variations of solar heating and night - time cooling lead to substantial changes in the internal pressure of the gas , and the equilibrium conditions thus cause a diurnal change in altitude and balloon envelope shape for a zpb . 
 spbs were developed to address this drawback in zpb float profiles , as we discuss below . 
 the largest zpbs now routinely carry 2000 kg or more of science weights to altitudes over 130,000 ft ( nearly 40 km ) , where the atmospheric overburden is below 3 mbar , or less than 0.3% of sealevel pressure . 
 flights in antarctica have now exceeded 55 days at float , and 1-month - at - float has become a more routine expectation as nasa and the national science foundation , which manages the antarctic program , have developed more effective protocols for log - duration flight support .    while costs for such missions have grown steadily as more complex instruments are developed and required for more challenging science , typical missions are still at least an order of magnitude and often two orders of magnitude smaller than equivalent costs to get a comparable payload to low - earth orbit . 
 thus it has become common to use balloon payloads to validate instruments prior to their promotion as a potential spacecraft instrument , and this has the added benefit of introducing new investigators to the nasa flight hardware development process under a much lower risk and lower cost environment . 
 in contrast to zpbs , spbs are not vented , and are designed to maintain a slight overpressure ( typically less than 100 pa 
 compare this to sea - level atmospheric pressure of @xmath0  pa ) relative to the ambient atmosphere at float . 
 this leads to a vast improvement in their float altitude profile , and almost completely suppresses the diurnal altitude changes . 
 this is illustrated by fig . 
 [ spb_v_vented ] which shows the altitude profiles for three payloads that were aloft at the same time during the 2009 austral summer season in antarctica : anita , cream , and a 7mcft spb test flight , which flew for 54 days during that year . 
 while anita and cream saw diurnal variations of 8 - 10kft over the 1.8 day period shown here , the variations for the spb were in the tens of m rms range . 
 super - pressure balloons are still largely in a development phase within the nasa balloon program , although they are now considered part of the proposable launch vehicle inventory , up to the 18 mcf size , although this latter balloon is still in its final testing phases prior to being available for production . the current schedule for the spb program is shown in fig . 
 [ spbsched ] , including the proof - flights for the 7mcf and 14mcf balloons , both of which are capable of carrying quite substantial payloads , a thousand kg or more to at least 110kft . 
 one of the most important roles that spbs will play in the future of the balloon program is that they will create the possibility of mid - latitude flights for up to 100 days , engendering payloads that wish to make night - side observations in these regions without paying the stiff penalty of a loss of altitude during the night - time cooling period . to facilitate such flights , southern hemisphere launch sites 
 must be identified which will allow for a complete orbit around the earth , with overflight agreements from the nations in the flight path . 
 currently the best potential site appears to be in argentina , but as yet no agreements have been reached regarding the overflight requirements . 
 lacking a mid - latitude launch sight and corresponding overflight plan , antarctica remains the centerpiece of scientific ballooning , affording the longest possible flights . 
 these are made during the austral summer months , early december through early february , when the polar vortex creates stable circumpolar flight paths . 
 payloads can thus also be assured of continuous solar illumination , allowing them to derive all of their operational power from photovoltaics . 
 the drawback is of course that no night flights are yet possible ; launch operations during austral winter are not yet under consideration , and in any case circumpolar orbits would not be possible since the stratospheric wind patterns are completely different than the summer months . 
 the very long possible exposures at float have created a demand for these flight opportunities , and nasa and nsf have responded by expanding the program recently to allow for up to three large payloads to be launched in each of the antarctic seasons . 
 [ tracks2012 ] shows the results from the most recent season , where three payloads , super - trans - iron galactic element recorder ( super - tiger ) , balloon - borne large - aperture sub - millimeter telescope ( blast - pol ) , and e and b experiment ( ebex , a cosmic background telescope ) all completed successful missions , with super - tiger breaking the record for the longest flight to date , 55 days over three orbits of the pole . 
 this latter flight illustrates nicely the behavior of the south polar vortex , which is characterized by stable stratospheric circulation . 
 launches are made from near mcmurdo station , at williams field , about 10 miles from mcmurdo on the ross ice shelf , which is about 50 meters thick at the launch site , floating over the ross sea . 
 the shelf is gradually moving toward ross island , at a rate such that the base has been moved twice already over the last three decades since the program began . despite this additional challenge , 
 the smooth , flat surface of the ice shelf provides and ideal platform for balloon launches , and the nasa program has become highly adapted to this location , with two large payload integration buildings , and a host of other supporting facilities , and ( as many have noted ) and a galley with some of the best food in antarctica !        since the advent of antarctic long - duration ballooning in the early 1990 s , 
 there have been several notable scientific results that bear repeating :    * boomerang flew in the early 1990 s , creating one of the first detailed maps of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations , and demonstrating the euclidean geometry of the universe . 
 this led to the 2006 balzan prize for astronomy and physics  @xcite , and was instrumental in engendering follow - on space missions such as the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) and its successors wmap and planck . * in a 2007 flight the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic ) measured an unexpected excess of 300 gev cosmic ray electrons  @xcite . 
 these observations , combined with positron evidence from the pamela spacecraft , led to speculation that a dark matter particle annihilation signature might be the origin of the anomaly , although current belief now favors a relatively nearby unidentified object such as a pulsar , as the source . * the 2006 - 2007 flight of the trans - iron galactic element recorder ( tiger ) was used to make precise measurements of the abundances of elements from 26fe to 34se , leading to some of the best evidence that acceleration of galactic cosmic rays takes place in ob star associations  @xcite . 
 the record - setting 2012 - 2013 super - tiger flight should provide much higher precision measurements of refractory element abundances . * 
 the balloon experiment with a superconducting spectrometer ( bess ) , a joint japanese - american collaboration , flew nine times since 1993 , and has made measurements of low - energy antiprotons and searches for anti - helium at levels of precision that lead to useful constraints on certain dark matter models , especially in combination with other experiments such as atic and the space - based platforms  @xcite . * 
 the cosmic ray energetics and mass ( cream ) experiment has reported a hardening of the cosmic ray energy spectrum below the knee , and this feature appears to be in tension with standard models of propagation for galactic cosmic rays  @xcite this result was enabled largely by the six total flights that cream was able to achieve in the program , leading to about 160 days of exposure livetime , the largest of any balloon - borne experiment to date . 
 * the antarctic impulsive transient antenna ( anita ) mission was flown initially in 2006 - 2007 as the first nasa ultra - high energy neutrino payload . in the process of calibrating the payload at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) , 
 anita made the first measurements of the askaryan effect 
 radio cherenkov emission from the negative charge excess in an electromagnetic cascade  in ice , using a 7.5 ton block - ice target in the slac end station a experiment hall . 
 this experiment was chose for the cover of physical review letters , the premier fundamental physics journal worldwide , as seen in fig . 
 [ prl1 ] . * 
 then , during the first anita flight , the payload not only set the best world limits on uhe neutrino fluxes  @xcite , but made a serendipitous observation of radio emission from 16 ultra - high energy cosmic rays , which interacted in the antarctic atmosphere , producing a narrow radio beam which then reflected off the ice surface up to the payload . 
 this unexpected discovery was not the first time radio pulses were seen from cosmic rays , but it was the highest energy set of such events ever recorded , and was unique in that the instrument was completely self - triggered . 
 these led to a second physical review letters cover , shown in fig . 
 [ prl2 ]  @xcite . 
 as noted above the current very long near - space exposures possible for payloads in the antarctic long - duration balloon program has led to renewed interest in these opportunities , and several new particle astrophysics efforts will be highlighted here . 
 the general antiparticle spectrometer experiment ( gaps ) instrument is designed to search for low - energy cosmic - ray antideuterons . 
 the detection of any such events would be significant , since although antideuterons are produced in interactions in the interstellar medium , the kinetic energies from those processes are expected to be high compared to the kinetic energy of antideuterons generated by dark matter annihilation . thus low - energy antideuterons provide a dark matter detection channel , if sufficient sensitivity and particle identification can be achieved . 
 gaps has developed a novel approach using a lithium drifted silicon tracker coupled to a time - of - flight system to separate antiprotons from antideuterons , and the approach promises to extend the low - energy reach below any other existing instrument if it is successful . 
 gaps has completed a prototype balloon flight which validated the basic system , but much work is still needed to achieve the low - energy sensitivity needed  @xcite .          the exavolt antenna ( eva ) mission is currently funded for nasa technology development toward a mission which would center on the use of a super - pressure balloon . 
 eva s goal is the detection of ultra - high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays through observations over antarctica , following in the spirit of the successful anita payload series , but with a plan to increase the sensitivity by as much as two orders of magnitude  @xcite . 
 eva s novel approach makes use of toroidal radio reflector / concentrator optics that are integral to the superpressure balloon itself . a @xmath1 
 m high reflective equatorial band on the outer balloon membrane forms a powered toroidal radio - frequency mirror , with a focus inside the balloon , about halfway between the center and the portion that is reflecting . 
 the optics are such that the balloon can receive radio impulses from any direction near the horizon , covering a very large synoptically viewed area of 1 - 2 m square kilometers . at the focal zone inside the balloon 
 , a membrane is suspended containing a feed antenna array which receives the power from the focusing optics . 
 [ eva - cut ] shows a cutaway view of the basic geometry of the system . 
 the light blue band represents the reflector band , and the red band in the interior is the feed antenna support . 
 this finite element model had only a small number of gores ; in practice the 18mcf full - scale version will have 280 gores . 
 eva s optics must be stable and smooth enough to avoid degrading reflected rf signals up to frequencies of several hundred mhz ; this is only possible using a spb , since the overpressure maintains a stable surface profile . 
 physical optics simulations and exact microwave scale models have confirmed that the optics perform well at the required radio wavelengths , and a 1/10 to 1/5-scale demonstration balloon is expected to be fabricated sometime in 2014 . 
 if the approach is validated and the technology readiness level can be raised , eva can be expected to be a contender for a near - future small explorer mission of opportunity . 
 the success of the cream payload has now led to selection of a cream follow - on for the international space station ( iss ) , given the acronym iss - cream ( pronounced like the ice - cold dessert ) . 
 because of the extended mission now given the iss , engendered by the continuing support for the alpha magnetic spectrometer , iss - cream will allow an upgraded version of the cream instrument to gather much higher statistics needed to resolve the behavior of the cosmic ray spectrum at the knee . 
 iss - cream is expected to be launched in 2014 .        in a twist , a mission planned for many years for the iss 
 , the japanese experiment module extreme universe space observatory ( jem - euso ) , which is slated to be lifted to the iss late this decade , will first validate some of its required measurements using a balloon payload . 
 jem - euso uses a very large fresnel - lens and associated fast camera to image the optical fluorescence emission from uhe cosmic ray air showers transiting the atmosphere below it , from an altitude of 350 km on the iss . by careful timing of the arrival of the fluorescence pulse 
 , jem - euso can determine the arrival direction of the primary particles , and by integrating the received light , establish their energy . 
 jem - euso will be the first uhe cosmic ray observatory in space , but to ensure that the measurements can be made with the requisite accuracy , the euso - balloon mission will attempt three flights in the 2014 - 2016 time frame with an instrument which will allow an end - to - end test of jem - euso s key technologies .    finally we note that anita s discovery that a balloon payload could successfully observe ultra - high energy cosmic rays has generated interest in extending this method of observation to a space - based platform , where the acceptance could be large enough to greatly extend the reach compared to even the largest ground - based observatories , providing a method that is highly complementary to the approach used by jem - euso . 
 the synoptic wideband orbiting radio detector ( sword ) satellite mission , now under development at nasa s jet propulsion lab , is a new concept based on anita s results  @xcite , and shown in concept in fig . 
 [ sword ] . 
 sword will fly a deployable interferometric antenna array covering the 30 - 300 mhz range , lower than that used by anita , but more tuned to the largest amplitude radio emission from uhe cosmic rays . 
 sword observes uhecrs through the reflection of the impulsive beamed radio emission off the earth s surface , whether ocean , land , or ice . 
 challenges faced by sword will be calibration of the reflective surface for each event , along with deconvolution of the ionospheric effects , which are quite strong , especially at the low end of sword s frequency range . 
 sword is planned as a low - cost smex mission , but could achieve sensitivity of nearly two orders of magnitude compared to ground - based observatories , particularly in the super - gzk energy range , above @xmath2  ev , where little is known about the endpoint behavior , and the sources should become more evident due to the much lower deflection by intergalactic magnetic fields . 
 sword is planned to fly at the next solar minimum , roughly 2019 .    in the interim 
 , anita will fly again in 2014 , and should measure several hundred more radio - detected uhecrs . 
 this will go a long way toward refining the radio emission models that are necessary to more precisely calibrate the response of instruments like sword , and it is likely that an anita - iv instrument will be proposed for the antarctic ldb program , with a specific goal of measuring even more such events .

71,"cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) and a mass - donating late - type main - sequence companion star . intermediate polars ( ips ) , an important subclass of cvs , are considered to involve wds with magnetic field of @xmath4 g. in an ip , gas from the companion forms an accretion disk down to a radius @xmath5 where gravity is counter - balanced by the magnetic pressure . 
 then the gas is captured by the wd s magnetosphere , and accretes onto the wd surface to form accretion columns due to strong magnetic field . in the accretion column , 
 the gas is heated up to @xmath6 k by a standing shock , and lands onto the wd surface emitting thermal x - rays . 
 if @xmath5 is far enough from the wd surface , the temperature @xmath7 just below the shock is proportional to gravitational potential of the wd ( aizu 1973 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is mean molecular weight and @xmath10 is the proton mass . 
 therefore the wd can be estimated by combining the measured @xmath7 with the standard mass v.s . 
 radius ( @xmath11-@xmath12 ) relation ( nauenberg 1972 ) . 
 an x - ray spectrum from ips is a superposition of optically - thin thermal emissions of various temperatures , from @xmath7 downwards . to determine @xmath7 
 , it is hence important to accurately measure both the hard x - ray continuum , and the ratio of fe xxv and xxvi lines at @xmath13 kev . 
 this is because the hard x - ray continuum is sensitive to the hottest components ( with temperature @xmath14 ) , whereas the latter tells us contributions from cooler components arising closer to the wd surface . 
 this method has been established with x - ray satellites such as _ ginga _ 
 ( e.g. ishida 1991 ) , _ asca _ 
 ( e.g. fujimoto & ishida 1997 , ezuka & ishida 1997 ) , _ rxte _ 
 ( e.g. suleimanov et al . 2005 ) , _ integral _ ( e.g. falanga et al . 2005 ) , _ swift _ ( e.g. brunschweiger et al . 
 2009 ) , and _ suzaku _ 
 ( e.g. yuasa et al . 
 2010 , hayashi et al . 
 2011 ) . 
 gk persei , a cataclysmic variable system , is interestingly categorized as both a dwarf nova and an ip . after a classical nova explosion in 1901 ( williams 1901 
 ; hale 1901 ) , it repeats , every 23 years , dwarf nova outbursts each lasting for 2 months ( e.g. imon 2001 ) . during outbursts , the optical and x - ray luminosities increase by a factor of 1020 . 
 the distance was measured to be @xmath15 pc ( harrison & bornak 2013 ) . 
 reinsch ( 1994 ) and morales - rueda et al . 
 ( 2002 ) optically determined the wd mass as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . 
 an outburst from gk persei started in march 2015 , and continued for 2 months ( wilber et al . 
 2015 ) . during this outburst , a too ( target of opportunity ) observation of _ 
 nustar _ was triggered ( zemko et al . 2016 ) . 
 suleimanov et al . 
 ( 2016 ) analyzed the too data and constrained the wd mass as @xmath18 . 
 _ suzaku _ was serendipitously pointed at the onset of this outburst ( yuasa et al . 
 2016 ) . with _ nustar _ , we observed gk persei again , after the object returned to its quiescence . 
 the present paper describes a combined analysis of the outburst and quiescence data from _ 
 the x - ray satellite _ nustar _ ( harrison et al . 
 2013 ) , launched on 2012 june 13 , has a 379 kev sensibility . 
 it is thus suited for our purpose , because we can study both the hard x - ray continuum and the fe - k lines . 
 as described in  1 , gk persei was observed twice with _ nustar _ 
 , once at the outburst peak and the other after the outburst terminated . 
 details of the observations are shown in table 1 . 
 we extracted the data from the two focal plane modules ( fpma and fpmb ) with nupipeline and nuproducts included in nustardas version 1.5.1 . 
 the source region was chosen to be a circle of @xmath19 radius for the outburst data , and @xmath20 for the quiescence data . 
 the remaining region was used for background . 
 we used nustar caldb version 20150904 . 
 the x - ray spectra were analyzed with xspec version 12.9.0 .

72,"the great achievements in manipulating and probing ultracold atoms in a cavity offer a new platform for exploring many - body systems and their dynamics . up to now 
 , the strong atom - cavity coupling has been experimentally demonstrated in several laboratories by using an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite . 
 the bec - cavity experiments can be used to study the coupled atom - photon system with both large and small atom and photon numbers  @xcite . 
 the bec - cavity system provides an ideal platform for exploring exotic many - body quantum effects , such as quantum phase transition  @xcite , many - body quantum entanglement  @xcite , precision measurement  @xcite , and many - body quantum dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand , as an important fundamental problem , the many - body landau - zener ( lz ) tunneling with 
 bec had attracted much attention for a long time  @xcite . 
 however , the many - body lz tunneling in bec - cavity system , in particular , how the cavity field affects the lz dynamics of atoms , is still unclear .    due to the atom - atom interaction 
 , the many - body lz tunneling is very different from the single - particle one . 
 the sequential lz tunneling induced by interaction blockade have been found in bose - josephson system ( bjs )  @xcite , bose - hubbard ladder  @xcite and spinor bec within optical superlattices  @xcite . 
 for an example , in a bjs  @xcite , due to the interplay between inter - mode bias and atom - atom interaction , the resonant tunneling and interaction blockade take place  @xcite . 
 there appears a population ladder indicating a series of interaction blockade . 
 the variance of the relative population would exhibit several peaks representing the single - atom resonant tunneling . due to the fixed josephson coupling in such a bjs , the step slopes of the ladder and the resonant tunneling peaks are symmetric about the zero bias ( which corresponds to the zero detuning ) .    in a bec - cavity system , due to the quantization nature of the cavity field 
 , the picture of the sequential lz dynamics may have significant differences . in comparison with the bjs , the rabi frequency in a bec - cavity system 
 acts the role of the josephson coupling . unlike the josephson coupling , 
 the rabi frequency is no longer fixed and it is proportional to the square root of the cavity - photon number  @xcite . in the case of few photons , as the photon number changes in the lz process , the rabi frequency dramatically changes when the detuning is tuned . 
 furthermore , if there is no sufficient photons to excite all the atoms to the upper level , an incomplete sequential lz process would occur . 
 thus , in addition to the atom - atom interaction and the detuning , the photon number also plays an important role in the lz process of the bec - cavity system . 
 simultaneously , during the time - evolution , the atoms may also have an influence on the cavity field . 
 therefore , it is of great interest to investigate : ( i ) how the sequential lz dynamics is affected by the cavity field ? and 
 ( ii ) how the cavity field changes during such a lz process ?    in this article 
 , we study the lz process of an ensemble of interacting bose condensed atoms trapped in a cavity . in the framework of second quantization 
 , the bec - cavity system can be described by a modified tavis - cummings model with an additional nonlinear term determined by atom - atom interaction  @xcite . 
 if the initial cavity field is described by a fock state , the bec - cavity system only involves a single excitation number . in the adiabatic sweeping of the detuning , the interplay between the detuning and the atom - atom interaction results in the asymmetric sequential lz transitions , in which the atoms absorb or emit photons one by one and the sequential lz transitions are asymmetric . 
 if the initial cavity field is described by a coherent state , the bec - cavity system will involve multiple excitation numbers . 
 different from the case of single excitation numbers , in the asymmetric sequential lz process , the atoms may no longer absorb entirely one photon for every population step . 
 the amount of absorbed / emmited photons becomes less than one and it gradually decreases even in the adiabatic limit . during the lz process , 
 the cavity field is no longer a coherent state and its intermittent collapse and revival appear . 
 this article is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec2 ] , we describe the model and give its hamiltonian . in sec . 
 [ sec3 ] , we investigate the asymmetric sequential lz process involving single excitation numbers . in sec . 
 [ sec4 ] , we consider the atoms initially coupled with a coherent cavity field , and then study the asymmetric sequential lz process involving multiple excitation numbers . 
 we derive an analytical formula for sequential ladders of the photon number and the relative atom number . 
 the adiabaticity conditions for the sequential lz transitions are also analytically estimated . 
 an intriguing findings of fractional steps are observed when the average number is small compared with atom number . in addition , we analyze the effects of the cavity photon loss on the sequential lz dynamics . 
 the phenomena of collapse and revivals of the cavity field are also revealed . 
 finally , in sec .  [ sec5 ] , we give a brief summary and discussion . 
 we consider an ensemble of bose condensed atoms occupying two different hyperfine levels and trapped in an optical cavity  @xcite . the sketch is shown in fig . 
 [ fig - schematic ] . 
 the atoms are coupled with a cavity mode , in which one atom in the lower level may absorb a photon and jump to the upper level , or may be taken from the upper level into the lower level with a photon emitted .    . here , 
 the frequencies of the cavity field and the atomic transition are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . 
 the detuning is @xmath2 and the effective atom - atom interaction is characterized by @xmath3 . ] 
 assuming that the coupling fields are spatially uniform and the atom - atom collision do not change the internal states . 
 each atom identically couples with a single - mode cavity cavity field  @xcite . 
 therefore , the system obeys a second quantized hamiltonian within a single - mode approximation ( in the unit of @xmath4 throughout the paper ) @xmath5 where @xmath0 is the frequency of cavity mode , @xmath6 is the atom number , @xmath7 is the hyperfine energy of the atoms in state @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the atom - atom interaction energies of state @xmath8 , @xmath10 is the atom - atom interaction energy between states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the homogenous coupling strength between the cavity mode and the bose condensed atoms .    regarding all the atoms as spin-1/2 particles , one can define the angular momentum operators as @xmath14    the system has two good quantum numbers : the atom number @xmath15 and the excitation number @xmath16 , satisfying the commutation @xmath17=0 $ ] and @xmath18=0 $ ] . here , 
 when the excitation number is much larger than the atom number , i.e. , @xmath19 , it corresponds to the large excitation number condition , which is close to the classical field limit . 
 while if the excitation number is comparable with or smaller than the atom number , i.e. , @xmath20 , it refers to the small excitation number condition . 
 the quantization of cavity mode would make a difference with a classical field and the photon number may affect the properties of the whole system . 
 we will carefully compare the results under large and small excitation conditions in the following . 
 since @xmath15 and @xmath21 are conserved quantities , the constant terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be eliminated and the hamiltonian becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the raising and lowering operators of atoms , the atomic transition frequency @xmath26 , and the effective atom - atom interaction @xmath27 . 
 further , shifting the zero point of the hamiltonian  , one can get @xmath28 with the detuning @xmath2 . according to the last term , for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath15 , 
 the rabi frequency is proportional to the square root of photon number ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , which is changeable with respect to the state of cavity field . 
 the state of the system can be expanded as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the photon number of the fock state , @xmath32 is the relative atom number and @xmath33 are the coefficients of basis @xmath34 . due to the conservation of excitation number , 
 when @xmath35 , the number of bases can be reduced to @xmath36 , the state of the system can be expanded as @xmath37 while for @xmath38 , only @xmath39 bases are enough , and the state of the system can be expanded as @xmath40 here , @xmath41 in eq .   and   denotes the coefficient with @xmath42 photons and @xmath43 atoms populating in the upper level . 
 firstly , we consider the system with fixed single excitation numbers and study the static properties of the system in small and large excitation number conditions . starting from hamiltonian  , 
 we choose atom number @xmath44 and investigate the situations with excitation numbers @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here 
 , the system state @xmath48 can be expressed according to eq .   or eq .  . 
 we vary @xmath49 from negative detuning to positive detuning and obtain the corresponding groundstates . 
 the detuning @xmath49 tends to populate the atoms into the upper level while the repulsive atom - atom interaction ( @xmath50 ) tends to populate the atoms equally in both levels . for far negative detuning , i.e. , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the groundstate is @xmath53 , which corresponds to that all atoms are in the lower level and the photon number equals to the excitation number @xmath21 . for far positive detuning , i.e. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 
 , the form of groundstate is related to the excitation number . when @xmath56 , the groundstate is @xmath57 , which is the state that all atoms occupy in the upper level and the photon number becomes @xmath58 . when @xmath59 , it becomes @xmath60 , where only a portion of atoms occupy in the upper level and no photons remain . in other regions of detuning 
 , the groundstate depends sensitively on the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath49 and @xmath3 . for better revealing the properties of the system , 
 the expectations of photon number @xmath61 and the half relative atom number @xmath62 , and the variance of relative atom number @xmath63 for the groundstate are calculated and shown in fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ] . 
 there appear a series of ladder - like steps for the half relative atom number . 
 these sequential population ladders are induced by the atom - atom interaction . 
 the steps become steeper and the plateaus get more smooth when the atom - atom interaction becomes larger . 
 the height of every step equals exactly 1 . for every step , 
 one of the atoms in the lower level can absorb one photon and be excited to the upper level . 
 the appearance of sequential population ladders is similar to the interaction blockade observed in the bose - josephson junctions  @xcite . 
 for a two - component bose - einstein condensate linked by classical raman fields , the competition between detuning and nonlinear interaction will result in a sequential population ladder for the relative atom number , where the slopes of the steps are exactly symmetric about @xmath64 . 
 however , for the two - state bose condensed atoms coupled with a quantized cavity mode , the number of the photons make the shape of the ladders significantly different . 
 when the excitation number is smaller than atom number @xmath59 , the structure is totally asymmetric since there are not enough photons to excite all the atoms and the population ladder ceases to increase when there are no photons inside the cavity , see fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( a ) . in the situation of @xmath46 , 
 the step slopes of the population ladders are also no longer symmetric about @xmath64 . 
 for the same magnitude of detuning @xmath65 , the step slope under negative detuning @xmath66 is always less sharper than the one under positive detuning @xmath67 . 
 the asymmetry of the step slopes comes from the changing rabi frequency during the sequential lz processes . 
 adiabatically sweeping the detuning from negative to positive , the photon number decreases downstairs from @xmath21 to 0 . 
 therefore , the rabi frequency @xmath68 is getting smaller . 
 the sharpness is determined by the ratio between rabi frequency and the atom - atom interaction @xmath69 , where the smaller @xmath69 corresponds to the sharper step slope . 
 specially , when the photon number decreases to zero , the rabi frequency vanishes , and no transitions would happen . since the photon number under negative detuning @xmath66 is always larger than the one under positive detuning @xmath67 , the step slopes of the ladder for @xmath70 is asymmetric about @xmath64 . 
 the first and the last step slopes have the biggest difference because they respectively correspond to the largest and smallest photon number , see the insets of fig .  [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( c ) . while for other pairs of step slopes , 
 the difference is smaller .    as the excitation number increases , the photon number difference under @xmath66 and @xmath67 becomes less dramatic and the rabi frequency @xmath68 tends to be uniform . for large excitation number @xmath47 , the step slopes of the ladder become almost symmetric about @xmath64 , see the insets of fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( e ) . 
 this is because when the photon number is extremely large compared with the atom number , the cavity field can be treated as a classical field with fixed complex number , and the sequential behaviors would return to the symmetric one in a bjs .      for further investigation 
 , we look in the variance of relative atom number @xmath71 . 
 there are a series of peaks for @xmath71 . 
 the locations of the peaks correspond to the locations of the step slopes in the ladder of @xmath70 . 
 the stronger atom - atom interaction @xmath3 induces sharper and narrower peaks , which is consistent with the sharpness of the step slopes . 
 when @xmath45 , the peaks are completely asymmetric . 
 there appear several peaks when @xmath72 and no peaks for @xmath73 , see fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( b ) . 
 the asymmetry is also obvious for @xmath46 , see fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( d ) . 
 the total structure is asymmetric about @xmath64 . 
 the width and height of first and the last peaks are totally different . 
 the last peak is much sharper than the first one , which is in accordance with the situation of the step slopes of population ladder . 
 the plateaus in the ladder of @xmath70 indicate the interaction blockades . 
 in the regions of the plateaus , the system is approximately in the state @xmath34 with definite photon number and relative atom number . 
 therefore , the variance of the relative atom number are suppressed . 
 the resonance peaks are caused by the quasi - degeneracy between the two states @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 in the neighboring plateaus . in the intermediate region of the step slopes 
 , the superposition of these two states leads to @xmath71 increasing dramatically . 
 one can treat the atom - photon coupling term as a perturbation  @xcite and obtain the locations of the peaks with @xmath77 for @xmath78 , which is in agreement with the numerical results . 
 more importantly , since the rabi frequency becomes weaker when the photon number decreases , the relative atom number also shows asymmetric properties . 
 when the rabi frequency decreases , the perturbation term becomes smaller , and the two neighboring states @xmath74 and @xmath75 are closer to degeneracy . 
 therefore , the variance of the relative atom number would appear narrower and sharper peaks at the degeneracy location . while for large excitation number 
 , the asymmetry becomes much smaller . under @xmath47 , the structure of the variance 
 @xmath71 become more symmetric about @xmath64 , see fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( f ) . 
 the set of peaks that indicate the single - atom resonance transition can be used to design the single - atom device . 
 for this system , varying the photon number in the cavity can adjust the sensitivity of the response and the atom - atom interaction need not be too strong , which can be promising for application in sensitive detection and high - precision metrology . 
 in the following , we consider the ensemble of interacting bose condensed atoms coupled with a cavity field in a coherent state . 
 the coherent state of photons is natural and it is easy to be prepared in experiments . 
 we sweep the detuning to investigate the lz dynamics of the system . 
 initially , the atoms are all prepared in the lower level . the cavity field is a coherent state , which is the eigenstate of annihilation operator @xmath79 and can be written as @xmath80 , with @xmath81 being the average photon number of the coherent state . 
 therefore , the initial state of the whole system can be expressed as @xmath82 which involves multiple excitation numbers with @xmath83 . during the sweeping 
 , the time - evolution of the system state @xmath84 obeys the schrdinger equation , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the hamiltonian   with time - dependent detuning @xmath87 . 
 the system state can be expanded as @xmath88 is the time - dependent coefficient of the basis in subspace with @xmath21 excitation number . 
 there are @xmath21 subspaces with different excitation numbers and the bases of each subspace depend on the excitation numbers . 
 each subspace with different @xmath21 is orthogonal and decoupled with others . 
 therefore , the dynamics in each subspace is independent and we can deal with the time - evolution problem individually and then sum up together according to the weight factor of each subspace @xmath89 . in addition , the average excitation number of the system is always conserved and equals the initial average photon number .    in our calculation 
 , we fix the atom number @xmath90 , coupling strength @xmath91 and atom - atom interaction @xmath92 . 
 meanwhile , the detuning @xmath49 is linearly swept according to @xmath93 with the initial detuning @xmath94 and the sweeping rate @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the total sweeping time . here 
 , we use @xmath97 to characterize the non - adiabaticity of the sweeping . 
 the smaller sweeping rate @xmath97 refers to a slower sweeping of detuning , which means more probability staying in the instantaneous ground state when the lz process occurs . 
 the properties of lz dynamics with multiple excitation numbers may differ according to the distribution of the excitation numbers which is related to the average photon number of the initial coherent state . here , 
 for initial coherent states , we choose the average photon number to be @xmath98 and @xmath99 . 
 the evolution of the photon number , the variance of relative atom number and the half relative atom number versus the detuning @xmath87 for different sweeping rates @xmath97 are shown in fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ] . 
 the three observables of the evolved state can be respectively calculated according to @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 \nonumber\\ & = & 4\{\sum_{n_e , l}(-\frac{n_a}{2}+l)^2 |w_{n_e}c^{n_e}_{l}(t)|^2 \nonumber\\ & -&[\sum_{n_e , l}(-\frac{n_a}{2}+l ) |w_{n_e } c^{n_e}_{l}(t)|^2]^2\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    for @xmath98 , where the average photon number equals the atom number , the population ladder for half relative atom number coincides with the one in adiabatic limit when the sweeping rate is sufficiently small ( e.g. , @xmath103 ) , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( a ) . 
 when the sweeping becomes fast ( e.g. , @xmath104 ) , the population ladder oscillates and the heights of the steps become less obvious . 
 the sequential lz transitions gradually disappear when the non - adiabatic effect is strong enough for extremely fast driving ( e.g. , @xmath105 ) . for @xmath99 , where the average photon number is much greater than the atom number , the sequential lz dynamics versus the non - adiabatic effect is similar , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( b ) 
 . however , it does not require such slow driving to attain its adiabatic limit ( e.g. , @xmath106 is slow enough while for @xmath98 is not ) . 
 that is because when the average photon number increases , the rabi frequency as well as the gaps of the avoided energy level crossings become larger . 
 the analytical analysis for adiabaticity condition is given in the next subsection . 
 the variances of the relative atom number for small and large @xmath81 are very different , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( c ) and ( d ) . for the adiabatic sweeping with @xmath99 , the variance @xmath107 is similar to the one with large single excitation number shown in fig . 
 [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( f ) . while for the adiabatic sweeping with @xmath98 , the variance @xmath107 appears two peaks for the first and second lz transitions and then shows a ladder - like structure with unequal step heights . 
 if the sequential lz transitions for small @xmath21 are incomplete , the atomic state is a superposition state of different @xmath32 and the corresponding variance @xmath107 becomes large . 
 thus , as the detuning increases , the systems is dominated by the incomplete sequential lz transitions for small @xmath21 , and the atomic number variance changes from peaks to ladder - like steps . while for large @xmath81 
 , the atomic state in every subspace changes synchronously and the variance would appear a series of peaks due to the quasi - degeneracy . 
 when taking the non - adiabatic effects into account , the variances change dramatically . for both @xmath98 and @xmath99 , under a very slow sweeping , the variances approach to their adiabatic limits . under intermediate sweeping , 
 the atomic state becomes a superposition state of different @xmath32 after every lz transitions . 
 as the lz transitions occur sequentially , more different @xmath32 components accumulate and induce the variance @xmath107 to increase in ladder - like steps ( e.g. , the blue dash - dotted lines in fig .  [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( c ) and ( d ) ) . 
 while for the fast sweeping , the system states hardly follow the instantaneous ground state and change slightly and the variances change more smoothly .    more interestingly , the sequential population ladders for small average photon number exhibit another kind of asymmetric property . 
 the heights ( but not the slopes ) of the steps are obviously unequal and become fractional , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( a ) and ( e ) . for @xmath98 , even though in the adiabatic limit , the height of each step is less than one and different with others . 
 the relative atom population ladder increases upstairs with the height of the steps gradually becomes smaller and smaller . 
 the 4 photons on average could not be entirely absorbed by the 4 atoms even after 4 times of lz transitions . 
 in contrast , for @xmath99 in adiabatic limit , the population ladder of half relative atom number increases upstairs with the each step s height equals nearly one , which is similar to the lz process with single excitation numbers shown in fig .  [ fig - single - excitation ] . 
 the coherent state with large average photon number can be approximately treated as a classical field . when the average photon number is large enough 
 , the initial atoms in the lower level could gradually absorb the photon one by one through every lz transitions , , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ]  ( b ) and ( f ) . 
 it is worth to mention that , when @xmath87 is swept adiabatically to 0 , the evolved atomic state becomes a twin fock state , in which the populations in upper and lower levels are exactly equal ( @xmath108 ) and the variance of the relative atom number @xmath109 . 
 the atomic twin fock state is a highly entangled state that can be used to implementing quantum metrology  @xcite . in our system , preparing the initial atomic state into @xmath110 and the cavity photon field into a coherent state with large @xmath81 , an atomic twin fock state can be generated via an adiabatic linear sweeping from negative detuning to zero . 
 this offers a new scheme for quantum state engineering on highly entangled state preparation .      . here 
 , @xmath21 are chosen from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , @xmath15=4 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . 
 the solid lines are obtained analytically according to eq .  . 
 the dashed lines are the numerical results . ]    to explore the sequential lz dynamics , we derive an analytical formula for ladders of the photon number and the relative atom number . in our model , the whole hilbert space can be divided into several decoupled subspaces and we can investigate the dynamics individually in every subspace and finally sum up together . for a subspace with excitation number @xmath21 and atom number @xmath15 , it would respectively occur @xmath15 and @xmath21 times of lz transitions for @xmath56 and @xmath113 . 
 the @xmath114-th lz transition happens between the states @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath115 . 
 therefore , the sequential lz transitions in a subspace can be treated as a sequence of conventional two - level lz transitions . in a conventional lz transition of a sweeping rate @xmath97 with the minimum gap @xmath116 for its avoided energy level crossing , and starting from its ground state at time @xmath117 , 
 the probability of finding the system remaining in the ground state at time @xmath118 is given by the lz formula  @xcite , @xmath119    by applying the conventional two - level lz formula to each avoided energy level crossing , the probability of staying in the instant ground state at @xmath114-th lz transition reads @xmath120.\ ] ] where @xmath121 denotes the minimum gap of the @xmath114-th lz transitions , which corresponds to the energy gap at @xmath122 with @xmath123 . 
 the @xmath114-th minimum gap is proportional to the atom - photon coupling term of the hamiltonian  , and it can be expressed in the form of @xmath124    by applying the lz formula   one by one , we can obtain the final probability of staying in the instant ground state after @xmath114 times of lz transitions , which is given as @xmath125 for every lz transition , the probability of remaining in the ground state also corresponds to the probability of absorbing one photon . 
 from this point , we can figure out the heights of every population steps of the photon number during the sweeping . 
 the height of the @xmath114-th step equals exactly @xmath126 . 
 therefore , the photon number of the plateaus in the ladder can be obtained analytically , @xmath127 correspondingly , the half relative atom number can be expressed as @xmath128 where @xmath129e_c$ ] and the index @xmath123 . 
 given a sweeping rate @xmath97 , one can figure out the population ladders analytically . in fig . 
 [ fig - lz ] , we plot the population ladders of photon number for @xmath130 under sweeping rates @xmath131 . 
 the dashed lines are the numerical results while the solid lines are obtained analytically according to eq .  . 
 it is obvious that , the analytical population ladders are well consistent with the numerical ones . since the minimum gap @xmath132 increases with excitation number @xmath21 , it needs slower driving for smaller @xmath21 . for fast sweeping @xmath105 
 , the step height decreases obviously when @xmath21 changes from @xmath112 to @xmath111 . while for slow sweeping @xmath104 , the step heights for most @xmath21 approach to 1 . 
 therefore , for small @xmath81 , the dominated @xmath21 is small and requires slower sweeping to access the adiabaticity condition .    by summing up the results of all subspaces , the average photon number and the half relative atom number of the system 
 are given as @xmath133 and @xmath134 in our system , the adiabatic condition can be estimated approximately according to @xmath135 ^ 2}{2\beta } \gtrsim 2.\ ] ] for @xmath98 , @xmath136 ; for @xmath99 , @xmath137 . 
 this estimation can be confirmed by the comparison with numerical calculations , see fig . 
 [ fig - dynamical - lz ] . 
 one of the interesting findings is the appearance of fractional steps in population ladders for small @xmath81 even under adiabatic sweeping . 
 this peculiar phenomenon results from the property of coherent state with few average photon number . 
 the initial coherent state is a superposition of infinite fock state including the vacuum state with different weight coefficients @xmath89 . for small @xmath21 
 , there is no sufficient photons to excite all the atoms to the upper level , and this incomplete sequential lz process would contribute to the fractional steps if the weight coefficient @xmath89 is non - ignorable . 
 below we give an analytical explanation for the fractional steps . 
 when the sweeping is adiabatic ( @xmath138 ) , all @xmath139 and so that the average photon number in subspace of @xmath21 becomes @xmath140 according to eq . 
 , the average photon number of the system can be obtained , @xmath141 using the condition that @xmath142 , we can simplify eq . 
 to @xmath143 from eq .  , we can further obtain the @xmath114-th step height of the photon number ( as well as the relative atom number ) , @xmath144 as a result , for small @xmath81 , the weight coefficients @xmath145 of small @xmath21 are dominated , which leads to the fractional steps . for example , @xmath98 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 and we can get @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . 
 the results are the same with the numerical findings . 
 while for large @xmath81 , the weight coefficients @xmath145 of small @xmath21 are nearly zero , and the height of every step equals 1 . since the total excitation number of the system is conserved , the explanation is also valid to the relative atom number .          in cavity qed experiments , the system would suffer decoherence induced by the escape of photons out of the cavity or the decay of the atoms without emitting photons  @xcite . 
 these decoherence effects may affect the sequential lz transitions . in this subsection 
 , we mainly discuss the effect of dissipation ( cavity photon loss ) on the sequential lz dynamics . during the sweeping 
 , the cavity photons may escape from the cavity and the total excitation number would no longer be conserved . 
 therefore , it is necessary to describe the system state by a reduced density matrix @xmath154 , where the bases of @xmath155 include different total excitation numbers and differ from the ones in eq .  . 
 the sequential dynamics under cavity photon loss can be characterized by the lindblad master equation  @xcite @xmath156+l_{\kappa}[\rho],\ ] ] with @xmath157=\frac{\kappa}{2}\left ( 2\hat a \rho \hat a^{\dagger } - \hat a^{\dagger } \hat a \rho -\rho \hat a^{\dagger } \hat a \right),\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the cavity photon loss rate .    in our calculation , the reduced density matrix of the system is broken up into different density matrices @xmath159 in subspaces . 
 then we solve the master equation   independently and calculate the observable expectation by @xmath160 and sum up together according to @xmath161 . 
 the time - evolution of photon number and half relative atom number under dissipation for @xmath98 are shown in fig . 
 [ fig - dissipation ] .    for @xmath162 
 , it returns to the ideal case , where the total excitation number is conserved . for @xmath163 , 
 the influences of the dissipation become obvious when the sweeping rates getting smaller . 
 given @xmath105 and @xmath104 , the influences of dissipation are very small and the sequential lz dynamics are almost unchanged , see fig . 
 [ fig - dissipation ]  ( a)-(d ) .    when the sweeping becomes slower , the total evolution time becomes longer and more photon losses accumulate . for @xmath103 , which approaches to the adiabatic limit for @xmath98 , although the cavity photon loss decreases the photon number , it only changes the step heights of the fractional ladders slightly , see fig . 
 [ fig - dissipation ]  ( e ) . 
 the cavity photon loss affects the ladder of the half relative atom number gradually , but the step heights shrink only a little during the whole processes , see fig . 
 [ fig - dissipation ]  ( f ) . 
 it is shown that , the cavity photon loss may also affect the sequential population ladders . 
 obviously , the sequential population ladders will disappear if the lost photons is large compared with @xmath81 . 
 however , if the lost photons is small compared with @xmath81 , which may be realized in the strong coupling regime  @xcite , the fractional steps of half relative atom number can still be observed . 
 we further investigate how the coherence of the cavity field varies during the lz processes with different sweeping rates . 
 since the evolution of each photon fock state will accumulate a phase dependent on the photon number , the phase differences between different fock state will also play an important role during the lz dynamics . in order to study the effect of this phase difference during the evolution , 
 a common quantity to measure is the expectation of the photon filed annihilation operator  @xcite @xmath164 which well describes the coherence of the cavity field . 
 the coherence of the photon filed @xmath165 versus the evolution time @xmath166 with different sweeping rates @xmath97 are shown in fig . 
 [ fig - collapse - revivals ]  ( a ) and ( b ) . 
 the dynamical behaviors of @xmath165 are much different with the ones of photon number @xmath167 . 
 when @xmath99 , for very fast sweeping @xmath105 , the coherence of the cavity field @xmath165 changes slightly . for modest sweeping @xmath168 , @xmath165 oscillates in ladder shape . for slower sweeping @xmath169 , 
 @xmath165 drops dramatically and remains zero when passing through all the lz transitions . 
 however , for very slow sweeping @xmath170 , @xmath165 drops rapidly to zero when the first lz transition happens and begins to increase and oscillate after the second lz transition . 
 finally , the coherence remains a certain value after all the lz transitions . 
 this is some kind of collapse and revivals of the cavity field coherence due to the long time accumulated phase difference between different fock state components of the coherent state . 
 the changes of the cavity field coherence for @xmath98 is similar with the one of @xmath99 . 
 for fast sweeping , the coherence of the photon filed @xmath165 changes slightly with small oscillations . for modest sweeping , @xmath165 oscillates in a downstairs ladder - like shape . 
 for very slow sweeping , the coherence of the cavity field @xmath165 first collapses and then revives . 
 it drops quickly at the first lz transition point and oscillates a lot afterwards until all the lz transitions finished . 
 however , for @xmath98 , the coherence of the cavity field seldom decreases to zero and the oscillations are more dramatic compared with the ones of @xmath99 . 
 the coherence of the cavity field will tend to a steady value after all the lz transitions and the final coherence @xmath171 depends on the sweeping rate . 
 below the dependence of @xmath171 on the inverse sweeping rate @xmath172 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig - collapse - revivals ]  ( c ) and ( d ) . obviously , the final coherence of the cavity field versus the inverse sweeping rate also exhibits the behavior of collapse and revivals . for @xmath99 , with fast sweeping , the collapse occurs as the difference between different fock state grows leading to a destructively interference . with slower sweeping 
 , the coherence drops to death and remains zero for a wide range . for much slower sweeping 
 , the phase differences grows back in phase and the coherence gradually begins to revive . 
 however , the revival will oscillate and finally cease for extremely slow sweeping . while for @xmath98 , the coherence changes more rapidly . 
 the final coherence of the cavity field drops dramatically at first but revives quickly and then begins to oscillate in disorder around a modest range . 
 it may be seen that , the cavity field coherence for small average photon number would not exhibit obvious collapse and revivals , which is different from the one for large average photon number . 
 in summary , we have explored the novel phenomena of asymmetric sequential lz dynamics in an ensemble of interacting two - level bose condensed atoms trapped in an optical cavity . 
 the features of bose condensed atoms in a cavity with small photon number are extremely different from the ones with large photon number . 
 for relatively small photon number , the interplay between the detuning and the atom - atom interaction leads to asymmetric sequential lz transitions . 
 there appear asymmetric interaction blockade and single - atom resonance tunneling when the lz process involves only a single excitation number , which is mainly due to the photon - number - dependent rabi frequency . 
 the single - atom resonance may be used to design high - precision devices and sensitive detectors .    instead of an initial fock state , considering an initial coherent cavity field with small average photon number , an asymmetric population ladder with unequal fractional height steps is observed . 
 the asymmetric sequential lz dynamics of the system are also studied . 
 we derive an analytical formula for sequential population ladders . 
 the adiabaticity conditions for the sequential lz transitions are analytically estimated . 
 an intriguing findings of fractional steps are also explained . 
 in addition , we analyze the effects of the cavity dissipation on the sequential lz dynamics . 
 on the other hand , the state of the cavity field changes dramatically during the time - evolution process . 
 the behaviors of collapse and revivals of the cavity field coherence are revealed . 
 further , for an initial coherent state with large average cavity - photon number , the sequential lz dynamics in a cavity approach to the one in a continuous laser field . starting from all atoms in the lower energy level , the atoms can absorb photons one by one in the sequential lz process if the detuning is swept sufficiently slow . 
 when the detuning is swept to zero , an atomic twin fock state can be generated . 
 in addition , the photon state is no longer a coherent state and its coherence changes dramatically . 
 this may be associated to the generation of photon - deleted coherent states  @xcite , which is totally non - classical . 
 similarly , if one sweeps the detuning oppositely , and the atoms are initially in the upper level , there would be the phenomenon that the atoms emit photons one by one during the sequential lz process . 
 this may be related to the creation of the photon - added coherent states  @xcite . 
 different from most previous schemes which add or subtract only a single photon , our this scheme can add or subtract desired number of photons by dynamically controlling the detuning . 
 this indicates that it may provide a new tool for preparing non - classical photon states and also may be applied to demonstrate the bosonic commutation relations  @xcite .

73,"understanding entanglement in quantum many - body systems is a powerful way to unveil their properties ( see the reviews  @xcite ) . among all possible ways to quantify non - local correlations in a many - particle system a key role is played by the entanglement entropy  @xcite . for a system characterized by a ( pure state ) density matrix @xmath1 the entanglement entropy is defined  given a partition into two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and a corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath4  as the von neumann entropy of @xmath5 , @xmath6 . 
 the scaling of @xmath7 with the size of the subsystem @xmath2 carries distinct information on the state of the system  @xcite . 
 the ground state of a short - range hamiltonian obeys an area law ( scaling like the measure of the border of subsystem @xmath2 ) , with important corrections arising when the system approaches a critical point . 
 excited states , on the other side  in a similar fashion as thermal states 
 follow typically a volume law , where the scaling is with the measure of subsystem @xmath2 ( a notable exception are many - body localized states  @xcite ) .    understanding the behaviour of entanglement entropy is also important in the description of the non - equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum many - body systems  @xcite . 
 numerous examples support this statement . 
 entanglement entropy was analysed in the adiabatic dynamics of a many - body system passing through a critical point  @xcite . on the opposite case of a rapid change of the coupling parameters 
 a quantum quench 
 calabrese and cardy  @xcite were the first to study the time - dependence of the entropy in a conformal field theory , specializing then to the case of a one - dimensional integrable spin chain . 
 they found that the entropy increases linearly before saturating to an asymptotic value ( that scales with the volume of the subsystem ) ( see also ref . 
 @xcite ) . in the presence of disorder , for a many - body localized state 
 , the entropy increases logarithmically  @xcite  a behaviour intimately connected to the dephasing mechanism characteristic of this phase . for a disordered ergodic system  on the opposite  the disorder - averaged entanglement entropy increases linearly in time before saturation , and the asymptotic disorder - distribution of the entanglement entropy coincides with the thermal one  @xcite . 
 in addition to the interest in its own , the study of the entanglement is also of utmost importance in connection with the possibility to numerically study correlated systems by means of classical simulations , as e.g. the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite . 
 indeed the power of numerical simulations is limited by the amount of entanglement present in the quantum state . 
 we will analyse the entanglement entropy in another class of non - equilibrium dynamics in which the quantum system is subject to a periodic driving . in recent years 
 there has been an uprising interest for periodically driven closed quantum systems , with special emphasis on the existence of an asymptotic time - periodic steady state and the conditions under which it shows thermal properties  @xcite . 
 the asymptotic state of open driven quantum systems has also been studied in refs . 
 @xcite .    from now on , 
 we will focus our attention on closed driven quantum systems . by means of floquet theory  @xcite , 
 formal similarities between this case and that of a quantum quench have been discovered ; at the same time , many results first obtained in the case of a quantum quench have been generalized to the periodic driving case . 
 one example is the relaxation to the floquet diagonal ensemble of periodically driven systems  @xcite . 
 the behaviour of the entanglement entropy has been analysed as well in periodically driven systems . 
 the relation between the way entanglement entropy grows in time and the system being many - body localized or ergodic is the same in periodically driven systems and quantum quenches  @xcite . 
 transitions between regimes with anomalous scaling exponents in the finite - time entanglement entropy of an integrable fermionic system was discussed in ref . 
 @xcite . in ref . 
 @xcite the authors study the entanglement entropy of a free electron chain undergoing a periodic quench , discussing relations to equilibrium lattice models . 
 they find the entanglement entropy saturating to an asymptotic value proportional to the volume of the subsystem , displaying in general slow oscillations in time . in ref . 
 @xcite the authors describe the periodic driving of the heisenberg model . 
 they see that the entanglement entropy saturates after a transient to an asymptotic value obeying a volume law . 
 remarkably , this asymptotic value is the same as the @xmath8-completely mixed density matrix : the periodic driving makes this system thermalize ( due to the absence of energy conservation a periodic driving can induce only @xmath8-thermalization  see  @xcite ) ) . 
 in this paper we consider the entanglement properties of an integrable quantum spin chain . 
 we focus on the entanglement entropy @xmath9 of a subchain of length @xmath10 for a quantum ising chain in transverse field undergoing a time - periodic driving of period @xmath0  @xcite . 
 the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time , until in the long - time limit an asymptotic @xmath0-periodic value @xmath11 is reached  . the asymptotic value , at leading order , is linear in @xmath10 : in the asymptotic regime the entropy follows a volume law , as occurs in the driven integrable system of  @xcite . 
 we go beyond the results of ref . 
 @xcite because  whatever is the form of the periodic drive  we are able to show this convergence analytically by means of floquet theory : we express the asymptotic value in terms of the floquet states of the driven system . 
 moreover , we are able to provide a semi - analytical formula for the coefficient of the leading - order - in-@xmath10 term : we find that it is not only @xmath0-periodic but even time - independent . 
 the system is integrable and locally relaxes to a non - thermal asymptotic condition  @xcite described by a special form of generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) density matrix  @xcite which we term floquet gge ( for more results on the gge in sudden quenches , see  @xcite ; refs . 
 @xcite discuss in detail gge for sudden quenches in the quantum ising chain ) . 
 we find that the leading - order - in-@xmath10 term in the asymptotic entanglement entropy is completely determined by the floquet gge . 
 therefore , by means of the entanglement entropy , we see that relaxation to the gge occurs at arbitrarily large length scales . in agreement with the absence of thermalization , 
 the asymptotic entropy is always well below the completely mixed @xmath8 density matrix value @xmath12 and depends on the parameters of the driving : we can see marked peaks in the asymptotic entropy in correspondence to some non - equilibrium quantum phase transition of a floquet - state - analog of the ground state  @xcite . 
 the behaviour we observe is peculiar to driven integrable systems . in the driven non - integrable case , on the contrary , there are two possibilities . 
 if the dynamics is ergodic , then the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time until the completely mixed state value is eventually reached  @xcite ; in the many - body localized case , instead , the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic increase  @xcite . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in section 
 [ ising : sec ] we introduce the dynamics of the uniform quantum ising chain in a time - periodic transverse field . 
 we discuss the application of floquet theory to this problem and introduce the form of the floquet gge density matrix describing the asymptotic periodic condition of local observables . 
 section  [ enta_dyna : sec ] is the heart of this paper : we evaluate the entanglement entropy in the periodically driven case showing that the entanglement entropy for any subchain relaxes to an asymptotically periodic value . 
 we show also that the leading term of the asymptotic value obeys a volume law ; we find a semi - analytical formula for this term and we see that it is completely determined by the floquet gge . in section  [ numerically : sec ] we show some numerical results corroborating our analysis and in section  [ conclusion : sec ] we draw our conclusions . 
 most technical details and analytical derivations can be found in the appendices . 
 while this manuscript was about to be submitted for publication , we became aware of similar results obtained by t. apollaro , g.  m. palma and j. marino  @xcite . 
 in this section we discuss the dynamics of a uniform quantum ising chain in transverse field ; we provide more details in  [ bogoliubov : sec ] and [ enta_entra : sec ] . 
 the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath13 here , the @xmath14 are spins ( pauli matrices ) at site @xmath15 of a chain of length @xmath16 with boundary conditions which can be periodic ( pbc ) @xmath17 or open ( obc ) @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a longitudinal coupling ( @xmath20 in the following ) . the transverse field is taken uniform and time - periodic , @xmath21 . 
 this hamiltonian can be transformed , through a jordan - wigner transformation ( see eq .   and refs . 
 @xcite ) , into a quadratic - fermion form . at equilibrium and for a homogeneous transverse field , 
 @xmath22 , the model has two gapped phases , a ferromagnetic ( @xmath23 ) , and a paramagnetic ( @xmath24 ) one , separated by a quantum phase transition at @xmath25 . 
 assume now that the transverse field oscillates periodically , for @xmath26 , around the uniform value @xmath27 , with some amplitude @xmath2 . 
 if we assume pbc for the spins , we can quite simplify the analysis : going to @xmath28-space ( we discuss more general cases in  [ bogoliubov : sec ] ) @xmath29 becomes a sum of two - level systems : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the sum over @xmath28 is restricted to positive @xmath28 s of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath16 even , corresponding to anti - periodic boundary conditions ( abc ) for the fermions @xcite , as appropriate to the subsector with an even number of fermions , where the initial ground state @xmath35  [ multiblock footnote omitted ] and the ensuing time - evolved state @xmath36 live  @xcite . 
 we will briefly refer to such a set of @xmath28 , in the following , as @xmath37 . 
 the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized in each @xmath28 sector with instantaneous eigenvalues @xmath38 . 
 we assume that at time @xmath39 the coherent evolution starts with the system in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath40 . 
 this ground state has a bcs - like form @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 expressed in terms of an angle @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 . 
 the evolution of the system can be naturally described through a floquet analysis @xcite . 
 details on how to compute floquet modes and quasi - energies in this case are given in @xcite and the related supplementary material . 
 in  [ bogoliubov : sec ] we show how to extend this picture to the case of obc or inhomogeneous couplings ; in this section we focus on the case of pbc for the spins because it is more transparent and instructive . 
 the state of the system at all times can be written in a bcs form @xmath46 where the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 obey the bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xmath49 with initial values @xmath50 and @xmath51 . 
 the previous analysis applies to a general @xmath52 . for a time - periodic @xmath52 
 , we can find a basis of states which are @xmath0-periodic `` up to a phase '' in each @xmath28-subspace . 
 these are the floquet states @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are @xmath55periodic , and are called floquet modes , while the @xmath56 are real and are called quasi - energies . 
 the two quasi - energies have opposite signs because @xmath57 has vanishing trace  @xcite . the state of the system at any time @xmath58 
 can then be expanded as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the overlap factors between the initial state @xmath61 and the floquet modes @xmath54 .    in  @xcite 
 we find that local observables @xmath62 in this system relax to an asymptotic @xmath0-periodic condition . in  @xcite 
 , we show that the asymptotic @xmath0-periodic condition is described by a @xmath0-periodic gge density matrix @xmath63 , which we define floquet generalized gibbs ensemble ( see also  @xcite ) . 
 we find @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( see eq . 
 for the definition of @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 are fermionic quasi - particle - number - operators @xmath0-periodic in time . 
 there are @xmath16 different @xmath67 operators ( as many as the degrees of freedom ) , which are in involution ( @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 ) . 
 the expectation value of the operators @xmath67 is conserved in time . in order to see that 
 , we show the precise definition of these operators . they are defined as @xmath71 , where the quasi - particle operators @xmath72 are a linear combination of @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath75 the @xmath55periodic objects @xmath76 and @xmath77 are defined in eq . 
 ( they are the components of the periodic floquet mode @xmath78 in the basis @xmath79  see eq .  ) . with these definitions , 
 it is not difficult to show that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant defined in eq .  . as we can see , the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble eq 
 depends on the initial conditions ( encoded in @xmath82 ) and is never thermal : the system is integrable and there are too many conserved quantities ( the @xmath83 ) to allow thermalization . 
 we would like to emphasize that the picture above is strictly analogous to the well known situation of the relaxation to the gge of an integrable system with @xmath84 degrees of freedom after a quantum quench  @xcite . 
 in this case the system has @xmath84 ( local or quasi - particle - number - like ) operators @xmath85 , which are in involution and have an expectation value constant in time  @xcite . 
 the system locally relaxes to a gge density matrix @xmath86 which is expressed in terms of the operators @xmath85 and has a structure very similar to eq . 
 ( @xmath87 , where @xmath88 are some constants fixed by the initial state ) .    in the next section 
 we are going to see how the floquet theory allows us to show that the stroboscopic entanglement entropy of any subchain attains an asymptotic @xmath0-periodic regime . 
 we find a semi - analytical expression for its leading - order value , which depends only on the information contained in the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble . 
 the entanglement entropy can be obtained from the solutions @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations . in  [ enta_entra : sec ] we show how to use these solutions to compute a special @xmath89 time - dependent toeplitz matrix ( eq .  ) . in terms of its @xmath90 eigenvalues 
 @xmath91 , @xmath92 , we can construct the entanglement entropy of the subchain as @xmath93 , where we have defined the function @xmath94 . 
 this holds true for a generic time - dependent @xmath52 .    in the case of a periodic driving , @xmath95 
 , we can say something more . by applying the floquet theory and the riemann - lebesgue lemma , we are able to show that the entanglement entropy tends towards an asymptotic value which is @xmath0-periodic . 
 we find that this asymptotically periodic entanglement entropy can be obtained from the eigenvalues a special @xmath89 @xmath0-periodic toeplitz matrix ( eq .  ) which can be evaluated starting from the solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations expanded in the floquet basis ( see eqs .   and  ) 
 defining the eigenvalues of such a toeplitz matrix as @xmath96 , @xmath92 , the asymptotic entanglement entropy turns out to be given by @xmath97 all the details of the derivations of this expression are reported in  [ relaxation : sec ] . 
 the discovery of this relaxation phenomenon is one of the main results of the paper . 
 an important , we believe , observation is that @xmath98 obeys a volume law . with an argument analogous to the one used in ref . 
 @xcite , we show in  [ appendix - semi ] that @xmath99 \ 
 , , \ ] ] where @xmath66 have been defined in eq .  . hence , remarkably , the leading term in the asymptotic @xmath0-periodic entanglement entropy is _ time - independent _ and proportional to @xmath10 ( with at most logarithmic corrections ) : this is reminiscent of the result valid in the case of a quantum quench , found in ref . 
 the coefficient @xmath100 is @xmath101 times the von neumann entropy of the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble density matrix @xmath63 ( eq .  ) . 
 so , the entanglement entropy shows that the system relaxes to the floquet gge ensemble at any arbitrarily long spatial scale @xmath10 . 
 we can see that @xmath66 depend strongly on what is the chosen initial state , and so does @xmath100 ; in particular , we never see thermalization , as we are going to show in the next section where we substantiate our analytical formulae with numerical results . 
 numerically solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations   by means of a 4th - order runge - kutta algorithm ( see for instance  @xcite ) , we can explicitly see the relaxation of the entanglement entropy and the validity of the asymptotic value expansion eq .  . 
 in all this section we choose a driving of the form @xmath102 where we assume for simplicity @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the presentation of the results we will restrict to stroboscopic times of the form @xmath106 with @xmath107 . on one side , this choice simplifies the numerical calculations . on the other side 
 , the asymptotically periodic condition for @xmath98 appears as an approach to an asymptotic constant value @xmath108 , which can be seen more easily . 
 we show some examples of stroboscopic relaxation in fig . 
 [ entroppo : fig ] . in all the cases 
 we have considered , we see that the ( stroboscopic ) entanglement entropy reaches , after a transient , its asymptotic value @xmath108 . 
 we can see that the transient lasts for a time linearly scaling with @xmath10 . 
 it is not difficult to qualitatively understand this fact . in each point of the system 
 the periodic drive generates quasi - particle excitations which propagate at finite velocity , bringing with them correlations : a longer subchain takes proportionally more time to get fully entangled with the rest of the system . 
 this picture strictly resembles the case of quantum quench of  @xcite . 
 it explains why the leading term in the asymptotic entanglement entropy follows a volume law : quasi - particles are generated in every point of the subchain so , after a while , the whole subchain is correlated with the rest of the system . in the top panels of fig . 
 [ entroppo : fig ] we show the situation in the case of pbc on the spins ( abc on the fermions ) , in the bottom ones we consider the case of obc . in the second case the convergence to the asymptotic value is slower ( more or less ) by a factor 2 : we are considering a subchain with a loose end , and excitations can propagate only towards one direction . 
 moreover , taking obc , the oscillations around the asymptotic value seem to be smaller than in the pbc case .    [ cols=""^,^ "" , ]     we would like to stress that in all the cases we have considered , @xmath109 is always well below the thermal @xmath8 value @xmath110 ( being the system periodically driven , due to the absence of energy conservation , it can only thermalize at @xmath8  @xcite ) . 
 the system can not thermalize because it is integrable and locally relaxes to the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble eq .  . 
 as we go to small frequencies , @xmath109 decreases . 
 this is expected in the adiabatic limit , where the driving excites a vanishingly small number of excitations : there is indeed nothing which can propagate quantum correlations . 
 the adiabatic limit occurs when the characteristic frequency scale of the perturbation is much smaller than the minimum energy gap encountered during the dynamics  @xcite . 
 thanks to the factorization of the hamiltonian ( see eq .  ) , only the single - particle gaps ( those for each @xmath111 @xmath112subspace ) are important : the adiabatic limit hence corresponds to @xmath113 . from a numerical point of view 
 , it would be quite time - consuming to consider very small frequencies in fig . 
 [ sinfomega : fig ] . 
 when the frequency is very small , the floquet spectrum undergoes multiple foldings in the first floquet - brillouin zone @xmath114 $ ] : as @xmath28 changes the quasi - energies @xmath115 undergo many avoided crossings . at each crossing 
 , the quantities @xmath116 undergo quite sudden changes ( see the sm of  @xcite ) : hence the integrand in eq . 
 is a strongly oscillating function of @xmath28 . 
 for very low frequencies , we need indeed very fine meshes in @xmath28 ( hence , very long chains ) to obtain a good estimate of the integral . 
 we have discussed the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in a time - periodically - driven quantum ising chain in transverse field . we have observed that the entanglement entropy relaxes asymptotically to a time - periodic value with the same period of the driving . 
 the asymptotic entropy is attained after a transient in time whose duration scales linearly with the size of the subsystem ; we are able to express the asymptotic regime in terms of the floquet states of the driven system . 
 the asymptotic entropy , at leading order , follows a volume law in the size of the chain : we have found a semi - analytical formula for the coefficient of the leading order term . 
 quite remarkably , this coefficient is not periodic but time - independent ; its dependence on @xmath117 is reminiscent of quantum phase transitions of the floquet ground state . 
 although following a volume law , the asymptotic entropy stays always well below the thermal value : the system is integrable and locally relaxes to a floquet gge ensemble . 
 noteworthy , the leading term in the asymptotic entropy is proportional to the von neumann entropy of the floquet gge density matrix . 
 so the floquet gge gives the asymptotic properties of the system at any arbitrarily long spatial scale @xmath10 . 
 it is interesting to consider what happens to the picture we have described in the presence of disorder . in principle , arbitrary inhomogenous couplings can be tackled by the approach presented in [ bogoliubov : sec ] . but disorder should lead to localization of the states , and hence correlations should not be able to propagate efficiently  @xcite . 
 we defer to future publications the analysis of this case and the study of different time - driving protocols 
 . it would also be interesting to know if an analysis for generic driven one - dimensional systems based on conformal field theory is possible , in the spirit of what ref . 
 @xcite does for quenched one - dimensional systems .

 in this appendix we briefly describe the quantum dynamics of ising / xy chains  @xcite . here 
 we do not assume translational invariance , therefore fourier transform to momentum space can not be employed . 
 we closely follow the discussion of ref . 
 generically , if @xmath119 denote the @xmath16 fermionic operators originating from the jordan - wigner transformation of spin operators  @xcite @xmath120 we can write the hamiltonian in eq .   as a quadratic fermionic form @xmath121 here @xmath122 are @xmath123-components ( nambu ) fermionic operators defined as @xmath124 ( for @xmath125 ) and @xmath126 , and @xmath127 is a @xmath128 hermitian matrix having the explicit form shown on the right - hand side , with @xmath129 an @xmath130 real symmetric matrix , @xmath131 an @xmath130 real anti - symmetric matrix . 
 such a form of @xmath127 implies a particle - hole symmetry : if @xmath132 is an instantaneous eigenvector of @xmath127 with eigenvalue @xmath133 , then @xmath134 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath135 . 
 let us now focus on a given time , @xmath39 , or alternatively suppose that the hamiltonian is time - independent . 
 then , we can apply a unitary bogoliubov transformation @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are @xmath130 matrices collecting all the eigenvectors of @xmath139 , by column , turning the hamiltonian in eq .   in the diagonal form @xmath140 where the @xmath141 are new quasiparticle fermionic operators . 
 the ground state @xmath142 has energy @xmath143 and is the vacuum of the @xmath141 for all values of @xmath144 : @xmath145 . to discuss the quantum dynamics 
 when @xmath146 depends on time , one starts by writing the heisenberg equations of motion for the @xmath122 , which turn out to be _ linear _ , due to the quadratic nature of @xmath29 . 
 a simple calculation shows that : @xmath147 the factor @xmath148 on the right - hand side originating from the off - diagonal contributions due to @xmath149 . 
 these heisenberg equations should be solved with the initial condition that , at time @xmath39 , is @xmath150 a solution is evidently given by @xmath151 with the same @xmath152 used to diagonalize the initial @xmath39 problem , as long as the time - dependent coefficients of the unitary @xmath153 matrix @xmath154 satisfy the ordinary linear bogoliubov - de gennes time - dependent equations : @xmath155 with initial conditions @xmath156 . it is easy to verify that the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes form implies that the operators @xmath157 in the schrdinger picture are time - dependent and annihilate the time - dependent state @xmath158 . 
 notice that @xmath154 looks like the unitary evolution operator of a @xmath123-dimensional problem with hamiltonian @xmath159 . 
 this implies that one can use a floquet analysis to get @xmath154 whenever @xmath160 is time - periodic . 
 this trick provides us with _ single - particle _ floquet modes and quasi - energies in terms of which we can evaluate , through the heisenberg picture prescription , any two - point correlator @xmath161 , @xmath162 . because the state is gaussian , from those objects one can reconstruct the expectation of any operator and also the entanglement entropy of any subchain as we show in  [ enta_entra : sec ] . to that purpose , it is very useful to rewrite eq .   in the schrdinger representation : we obtain @xmath163 here we have defined @xmath164 as an @xmath16-components fermionic operators defined as @xmath165 for @xmath166 ; @xmath167 is the time - evolution operator in the full hilbert space such that @xmath168 and @xmath169 . with these definitions , 
 it is easy to see that @xmath170 
 in this section we show explicitly the computation of the entanglement entropy in the driven quantum ising chain which leads to the results of sec . 
 [ enta_dyna : sec ] . 
 we express the entropy in terms of the solution of the dynamical bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( [ bogoliubov : sec ] ) . 
 we generalize to the case of driven systems the methods for the evaluation of the entanglement entropy in the static chain introduced in ref . 
 @xcite .      in this subsection 
 we introduce majorana fermions starting from the bogoliubov fermions of  [ bogoliubov : sec ] and then we express their correlation matrix in terms of the solution of the dynamical bogoliubov - de gennes equations . 
 we are going to see in subsection  [ entroval_subsec ] that this correlation matrix is an essential ingredient to evaluate the entanglement entropy of any sub - chain . 
 we are going to see first the generic case and then the translationally - invariant one . in the latter case , 
 the correlation matrix assumes a block - diagonal form in @xmath28-space , which allows to fasten the numerical calculations . 
 we consider a generic form of external driving : we can apply the results of  [ bogoliubov : sec ] . 
 in particular , by inverting the unitary matrix @xmath171 obeying eq .  , we can rewrite eq .   in the form @xmath172 
 \left(\begin{array}{c}{{\hat{c}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{j}}\\                                                       { { \hat{c}^{\dagger}}_{j } }                                        \end{array}\right)\,.\ ] ] to obtain the entanglement entropy , we have to introduce two sets of majorana operators ( see refs . 
 @xcite ) @xmath173       \left(\begin{array}{c}{{\hat{c}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{l}}\\{{\hat{c}^{\dagger}}_{l}}\end{array}\right ) \quad{\rm

 we can immediately find @xmath177    \left(\begin{array}{c }     { { \check{c}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{2j-1}}\\     { { \check{c}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{2j } }    \end{array}\right)\ , . \ ] ] we can recast this formula as @xmath178 thanks to the unitarity of the @xmath130 matrix @xmath179 , we can see that the @xmath128 matrix @xmath180 ( @xmath181_{\sigma n}=w_{\sigma n}(t)$ ] ) is an orthogonal matrix @xmath182 . at this point 
 we can evaluate the correlation matrix of the operators @xmath183 . to do that , we notice that  thanks to eq . 
 we have the following averages @xmath184 where the bracket indicates the average over the state @xmath36 . using eq . 
 it is easy to verify that\right\rangle}_t\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[1-i{\left\langle { { \check{\gamma}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{2\mu-1}}{{\check{\gamma}^{\phantom \dagger}}_{2\mu}}\right\rangle}_t\right]\,.\ ] ] in this way we show that @xmath185 . because of the anticommutation rules , we have also @xmath186 . to show that all the other correlators of those majorana operators vanish , we take @xmath187 and the conclusion follows substituting eq .   in the relations @xmath188 . ] 
 the correlation matrix is @xmath189 where we have defined the @xmath128 matrix @xmath190\,.\ ] ] the correlation matrix of the original majorana operators @xmath191 can be obtained from this one by means of the transformation eq .  ; the orthogonality of the transformation matrix @xmath192 and eq .   give @xmath193 where we have defined the @xmath128 matrix @xmath194 both the matrices @xmath195 and @xmath196 are skew - symmetric . the coefficients @xmath197 and @xmath198 from which these matrices are obtained can be numerically evaluated by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations eq .  .      when the system is translationally invariant , it is possible to relate the coefficients @xmath199 , @xmath200 of the matrix @xmath201 to the coefficients @xmath202 and @xmath203 , rapidly found by moving to @xmath28-space and integrating there the @xmath16 decoupled @xmath111 bogoliubov - de gennes systems of equations eq .  . here 
 the fermionic hamiltonian is block - diagonal ( see eq .  ) . 
 also the bogoliubov operators eq 
 .   have definite momentum and are related to the @xmath73 by means of a unitary transformation constructed by means of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 of eq . 
 @xmath204 introducing the majorana operators as in eq .  , we find that the @xmath205 and the @xmath206 are related by means of the orthogonal transformation @xmath207 using the polar representation @xmath208 , @xmath209 , we can write the matrix @xmath210 in the form @xmath211 because of the orthogonality of the matrix @xmath210 , we have the relations @xmath212 thanks to eq .  , we see that the correlation of the @xmath205 has the @xmath28-factorized form @xmath213 from this we can find the correlation matrix of the @xmath73 operators , defined analogously , which is still factorized in @xmath28 : it has the form @xmath214 it is not difficult to see that @xmath215\sigma^y}\nonumber\\     & & \hspace{1.5cm}=2i\left[{\operatorname{\re{\rm e}}}(u_k(t)v_k^*(t))\,\sigma^x-{\operatorname{\im{\rm m}}}(u_k(t)v_k^*(t))\,\sigma^z\right]\ , . \ ] ] from this we can find the correlation matrix @xmath216 of the operators @xmath217 . because we have @xmath218 we can write @xmath219 from this relation , defining the matrix @xmath220 we find that the correlation matrix is a @xmath128 matrix composed by @xmath111 blocks .

 let us also consider  for reasons that will be clear soon  the @xmath89 submatrix @xmath222 which corresponds to some specific subsystem . 
 this submatrix has the block toeplitz form @xmath223 where we have defined @xmath224 the @xmath47 and @xmath48 are solutions of eq .  . 
 is the bloch - sphere representative of the state @xmath225 . 
 moreover , it is not difficult to verify that  taking for @xmath202 and @xmath203 the values which these objects assume in the ground state 
 .   reduces to the well - known formula given in ref . 
 @xcite ] the hamiltonian matrix in eq 
 .   obeys the symmetry relation 
 @xmath226 : this implies that @xmath227 and @xmath228 . from this 
 it follows that @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 : this implies that the matrix @xmath232 is antisymmetric , as it should be . 
 it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath233 is hermitian : it has @xmath90 eigenvalues of the form @xmath234 . in the next subsection we are going to show how to use these eigenvalues to evaluate the entanglement entropy of the considered subchain . 
 here we specialize the considerations of the section above to the case of periodic driving with period @xmath107 . expanding the floquet states @xmath276 in the basis @xmath277 ( see sec . 
 [ ising : sec ] ) we can find the floquet solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations eq . 
 @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 are @xmath55periodic objects . 
 expanding eq .   in the basis @xmath281 , we can write a generic solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations as @xmath282 substituting in eq .  , we find @xmath283 with @xmath284 when @xmath58 is large , the terms with superscript @xmath285 are wildly oscillating in @xmath28 because of the factor @xmath286 : integrating them over @xmath28 we obtain a vanishingly small contribution . only the terms with superscript @xmath287 survive : they are objects periodic with period @xmath0 . 
 therefore , asymptotically , the correlation matrix becomes the @xmath0-periodic object @xmath288 @xmath289 @xmath290 we see indeed that the correlation matrix relaxes asymptotically to a periodic value , and the same does the entanglement entropy . 
 if the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath291 are @xmath96 , @xmath292 ( they are real and @xmath293 $ ] as we show in  [ entroval_subsec ] ) , the entropy asymptotically becomes @xmath294 with @xmath295 defined in eq .  . 
 in this appendix , we are going to explicitly demonstrate eq .  . 
 we perform an analysis very similar to the one introduced by calabrese and cardy in ref . 
 we define @xmath305 being @xmath306  '' and we do not make explicit the dependence on @xmath58 in the @xmath306 in order to have a simpler notation . ] the eigenvalues of @xmath307 , we see that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath308 are @xmath309 . 
 its determinant is therefore @xmath310 applying the cauchy theorem to eq .  , we find that we can write the asymptotic entanglement entropy @xmath98 as  @xcite @xmath311 ( the second equality can be verified by direct substitution ) . 
 the contour encircles the interval @xmath312 $ ] where there are the poles of @xmath313 ; it tends to this interval as @xmath314 . 
 the @xmath315 in the first argument of @xmath316 is necessary to make the branch cuts of @xmath316 to be outside the integration contour : inside the contour the function is analytical and this justifies the application of the cauchy theorem .    using the definitions we find @xmath317 where we have defined @xmath318 which is remarkably _ time - independent_. we see that @xmath319 because this is the norm of the bloch - vector representative of the floquet gge density matrix ( eq .  ) which can also be written as @xmath320 we find indeed ( omitting the logarithmic corrections ) @xmath321 substituting in eq .   and using the value of @xmath322 
 , we find @xmath323 being @xmath324 , both the poles fall inside the integration contour and we can explicitly perform the integral in @xmath325 eq .  . 
 after this straightforward integration , we send @xmath314 and find eq . 
 @xmath326 \,,\nonumber \ ] ] where @xmath295 is defined in eq . 
 and we have used the symmetry @xmath327 which is implied by the hamiltonian matrix in eq .   obeying the relation @xmath226 
 we stress that we can not apply the foregoing argument for @xmath58 finite : in that case we have @xmath328 for all @xmath28 . 
 all the poles in eq .   coincide and this analysis is not suitable . 
 that is so because in this case @xmath329 is the norm of the bloch vector of the pure state @xmath330 .

 this point of view is similar to the approach used in universal source coding of individual sequences where the goal is to asymptotically attain for each sequence the same coding rate achieved by the best encoder from a model class , tuned to the sequence . 
 this framework is an evolution of those considered in shayevitz and feder @xcite and eswaran et . 
 @xcite and is presented in more detail in our papers @xcite and @xcite , together with the relevant background . 
 we will give a brief introduction below . 
 the setting we consider includes a single encoder receiving a message to transmit and emitting symbols @xmath0 and a decoder receiving a sequence of symbols @xmath1 and attempting to reconstruct the message . in the present paper 
 the input and output symbols are real - valued vectors , i.e. @xmath2 and @xmath3 . 
 the relation between @xmath4^t$ ] and @xmath5^t$ ] is unknown to the encoder and decoder . 
 we consider two communication scenarios : with feedback ( possibly imperfect ) and without feedback . 
 for the case in which there is no feedback the communication system transmits in a constant rate , and outage is unavoidable , i.e. one can not guarantee a small probability of error in all circumstances 
 . in the case feedback exists , the communication rate may be dynamically adapted and outage may be prevented . in both cases 
 we assume common randomness exists in the encoder and the decoder . 
 the results in the current paper extend the previous results , yet only for the first case , of transmission in a constant rate . 
 the performance is measured by a rate function @xmath6 representing an empirical measure of the achievable rate between the channel input and channel output , over @xmath7 channel uses . in examples here and in @xcite@xcite , 
 @xmath8 can be viewed as the mutual information achieved in a certain family of statistical models ( in the current scope , all zero mean gaussian channels ) , when the model parameters match the empirical ones . in communication without feedback 
 we say that a given rate function @xmath9 is achievable with an input distribution @xmath10 if for large block size @xmath11 , it is possible to communicate at any rate @xmath12 and an arbitrarily small error probability is obtained whenever @xmath13 . the communication system is required to emit blocks with probability distribution @xmath10 , which is possible due to the use of randomization . by placing this additional constraint 
 we leave aside the question of adapting the input distribution , so that the current framework attempts at achieving the empirical `` mutual information '' rather than the empirical `` capacity '' . 
 another reason for the fixed prior is avoiding degenerate systems which may transmit only `` bad '' sequences with low ( or zero ) @xmath8 . 
 this constraint is further discussed in @xcite , section viii.c . 
 the main result of this paper is that for the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel @xmath14 ( i.e. with @xmath15 transmit and @xmath16 receive antennas ) the rate function defined below is asymptotically achievable , in the fixed rate case : @xmath17 where the @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 denotes the channel input over @xmath7 symbols , and the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 denotes the output . 
 @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24^t [ \mt x \mt y]$ ] are the input , the output and the joint empirical correlation matrices , respectively . 
 this is a generalization of the result of @xcite where the rate function @xmath25 was proved to be achievable for real valued siso channel @xmath26 ( @xmath27 denotes empirical correlation ) . as in @xcite , 
 the proof is geometrically intuitive . 
 the results easily extend to the _ complex _ mimo case , and to rate function using the empirical _ covariance _ 
 ( rather than the correlation ) , but we focus here on the simpler case .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : rate_function_origin ] we explain the motivation for this rate function and its relation to the probabilistic gaussian channel , in section [ sec : main_result ] we present in detail the main result , which is proven in section [ sec : proof_of_lemma ] . 
 section [ sec : comments ] is devoted to comments and further research items . 
 we use lowercase boldface letters to denote vectors , and uppercase boldface letters to denote matrices . 
 we use the same notation for random variables and their sample values , and the distinction should be clear from the context . 
 consider the channel from @xmath28 to @xmath29 which are real valued vectors . 
 for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) mimo channel @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32 it is well known that the mutual information is @xmath33 see for example @xcite@xcite . 
 this reflects the maximum achievable rate with the fixed covariance matrix @xmath34 , and is sometimes termed the _ open - loop mimo capacity _ , since equal power is a reasonable choice when the transmitter does not know the channel . 
 a more general form of the mutual information is obtained by assuming @xmath35 are any jointly gaussian random vectors and writing : @xmath36\right ) \right|\end{aligned}\ ] ] therefore : @xmath37 \right ) \right| } \right]\ ] ] where the factors @xmath38 cancel out since the dimension of the covariance matrix in the denominator is the sum of the dimensions in the nominator . the expression ( [ eq : mi_mimo ] ) 
 is more general than ( [ eq : mi_mimo_awgn ] ) since it does not assume the noise is white , and is suitable for our purpose since it expresses the mutual information through properties of the input and output vectors without using an explicit channel structure . for the case of the awgn mimo channel it yields the same value as ( [ eq : mi_mimo_awgn ] ) . for the particular scalar case where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are scalars with variances @xmath41 
 , @xmath42 and correlation factor @xmath43 , equation ( [ eq : mi_mimo ] ) evaluates to @xmath44 , as previously obtained for the siso case . 
 the empirical rate function we defined in ( [ eq : remp_mimo ] ) is an empirical version of the mutual information expression in ( [ eq : mi_mimo ] ) , except that the covariance matrices are replaced by empirical _ 
 ( rather than covariance ) matrices , i.e. we do not cancel the mean . 
 when @xmath45 or @xmath46 ( which leads also to @xmath47 ) , the rate function will be defined by removing the columns of @xmath19 or @xmath21 ( respectively ) , which are linearly dependant on the others , until these determinants become positive . 
 it is not important which columns are removed to break the linear dependence , due to this function s invariance to linear transformation ( property [ property2 ] below ) . for the case of @xmath48 or @xmath49 
 we define @xmath50 . 
 the rate function has the following properties which are expected from an empirical metric of the `` mutual information '' :    1 . 
 [ property1 ] * non - negativity : * @xmath51 . 
 this is evident from the fact @xmath52 is the mutual information between two gaussian vectors with the respective covariances . 
 it will also be shown in passing as part of the derivation in section [ sec : proof_of_lemma ] . 
 [ property2 ] * invariance under linear transformations : * any invertible linear matrix operation on the input or output ( for example , multiplying any of the input or output signals by a factor , adding signals , etc ) does not change @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 . + _ proof : _ suppose we multiply @xmath19 and @xmath21 by arbitrary matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively 
 . define @xmath56 then @xmath57 . and likewise for @xmath21 . since @xmath58 = [ \mt x , \mt y ] \cdot \left [ \begin{array}{cc } \mt g_x & 0 \\ 0 & \mt g_y \end{array } \right]$ ] then from the same considerations we will have @xmath59 , therefore the factors cancel out and @xmath60 3 . 
 [ property3 ] * symmetry : * @xmath61 
 [ theorem : continuous_nonadaptive_mimo1 ] given the channel @xmath14 , define the input over @xmath7 symbols as an @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 , and the output as an @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 . 
 let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24^t [ \mt x \mt y]$ ] be the input , the output and the joint empirical correlation matrices , respectively . define the rate function @xmath62 then for every @xmath63 , a positive definite @xmath64 matrix @xmath65 and @xmath66 there exists random encoder - decoder pair of rate @xmath12 over block size @xmath7 , such that the distribution of the input sequence is @xmath67 and for any @xmath68 the probability of error for any message given an input sequence @xmath69 and output sequence @xmath70 is not greater than @xmath71 if : @xmath72 where @xmath73 specifically , for every @xmath74 and @xmath75 there exists @xmath7 large enough so that the probability of error is not greater than @xmath71 if : @xmath76    the theorem almost directly follows from the next lemma which we will prove subsequently :    [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] for any @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 , the probability of @xmath77 where @xmath19 is randomly drawn @xmath67 is bounded by : @xmath78 for any @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 , and where @xmath81 is defined in ( [ eq : value_of_c_l ] ) . 
 note that the bound does not depend on @xmath65 . to prove theorem [ theorem : continuous_nonadaptive_mimo1 ] , the codebook @xmath82 is randomly generated by i.i.d . 
 selection of each codeword from the gaussian matrix distribution @xmath83 . 
 the common randomness is the codebook itself . 
 the encoder sends the @xmath84-th codeword , and the decoder uses maximum empirical rate decoder i.e. chooses : @xmath85 where ties are broken arbitrarily . by using lemma [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] and the union bound , the probability of error given @xmath86 is bounded by : @xmath87\end{gathered}\ ] ]    therefore if ( [ eq : cond_on_r_to_fall_below_pe ] ) is satisfied , then @xmath88 , which proves the first part of the theorem . 
 the second part follows directly from the first part . for any @xmath75 and @xmath89 
 there is @xmath7 large enough so that the condition @xmath68 is satisfied , and then @xmath7 could be increased till the redundancy in ( [ eq : cond_on_r_to_fall_below_pe ] ) , @xmath90 would be smaller than @xmath91 ( note that @xmath81 is decreasing in @xmath7 ) , therefore @xmath88 will be satisfied if ( [ eq : asymptotic_cond_on_r_to_fall_below_pe ] ) is satisfied . 
 to prove lemma [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] we use the chernoff bound : @xmath92    to prove the lemma we need to calculate @xmath93 where the expected value is taken with respect to @xmath19 . 
 the remainder of this section is devoted to upper bounding @xmath94 . 
 we will first assume that @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 , and then extend to general @xmath65 . 
 define @xmath97 $ ] . 
 we perform a qr decomposition of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in order to obtain more friendly expressions . as a reminder 
 , qr decomposition of a matrix @xmath100 ( with @xmath101 and @xmath102 upper triangular ) is performed by gram - schmidt process . 
 we start from the left column of @xmath103 and work our way to the last one . at each time 
 we take a column of @xmath103 and split it to the part which can be represented by a linear combination of the columns to the left of it ( equivalently , to the columns of @xmath104 already generated ) , and the `` innovation '' , i.e. the part which is orthogonal to the subspace generated by the previous columns . the vector representing 
 the innovation is normalized , and becomes the respective column of @xmath104 , and its power becomes the diagonal element in @xmath102 . 
 the coefficients representing the part of the vector which is in the subspace of previous columns become the elements of @xmath102 above the diagonal . 
 another important property of qr decomposition is that the determinant of @xmath105 can be written in terms of the diagonal elements in @xmath102 : @xmath106 . 
 now define the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix in the qr decomposition of the matrices @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath99 respectively to be the vectors @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 $ ] . 
 i.e. if @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 then @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath109 = \mathrm{diag } ( \mt r_z)$ ] . 
 the lengths of the vectors @xmath115 are @xmath116 respectively , so that they overlap with the columns of @xmath21 and @xmath19 in the matrix @xmath99 . 
 we have : @xmath117 note that the @xmath118 factors cancel out because the matrix dimensions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the nominator and @xmath119 in the denominator . since the gram - schmidt process operates sequentially from the first column to the last , and the first @xmath16 columns of @xmath99 and @xmath21 are equal , we will have @xmath120 . 
 therefore we can write : @xmath121 
 note that @xmath122 and @xmath123 both relate to the same vector , the @xmath124-th column of @xmath19 . 
 the ratio @xmath125 is the ratio between the innovation of the @xmath124-th column of @xmath19 with respect to the subspace spanned by previous columns of @xmath19 alone ( nominator ) or these columns together with the columns of @xmath21 ( denominator ) . obviously from this reason 
 @xmath126 ( and therefore @xmath51 - property [ property1 ] ) . 
 the key observation in this derivation is as follows : consider a sequential drawing of the columns of @xmath19 and calculation of the factors @xmath125 . 
 since the @xmath124-th column of @xmath19 is chosen isotropically and independently of the previous columns , the value of previous columns does not affect the distribution of the innovations @xmath127 ( only the number of dimensions in previous columns does ) . using this observation which we will prove subsequently 
 , we would be able to break @xmath94 represented as the expected value of a product ( [ eq : r_as_ad ] ) into a product of expected values ( equations ( [ eq : l_prod_induction])-([eq : l_as_prod_d ] ) ) , and the proof is completed by a ( tedious ) calculation of these expected values .    to show the independence of @xmath128 in previously drawn values , denote by @xmath129 a matrix including the columns @xmath130 to @xmath124 of @xmath19 , and by @xmath131 the @xmath124-th column . 
 define a a unitary @xmath132 matrix @xmath104 whose first @xmath133 columns span the subspace spanned by the first @xmath133 columns of @xmath19 , its next @xmath16 columns extend this subspace to cover also the columns subspace of @xmath21 , and the next @xmath134 columns complete it to an orthonormal basis . 
 this matrix does not depend on @xmath135 and specifically on the column @xmath124 . 
 we assume that the columns of @xmath21 are linearly independent ( we will relax this assumption later ) . also , in probability one , assuming @xmath66 , the columns of @xmath136 are linearly independent of each other and of the columns of @xmath21 . to see this , 
 it is easy to show that the projection of each column in any direction orthogonal to the subspace already spanned by previous ones ( including @xmath21 ) , is also gaussian therefore has probability @xmath137 to be @xmath137 , as long as there exists such an orthogonal vector , i.e. the number of previously generated vectors is smaller than @xmath7 . 
 now define @xmath138 . since @xmath139 also @xmath140 . 
 the first @xmath133 elements of @xmath141 represent the projections of @xmath131 to the subspace spanned by previous columns of @xmath19 , and the next @xmath16 elements represent the projections to the subspace spanned by columns of @xmath21 . 
 so @xmath142 collects the energy of all elements except the first @xmath133 , and @xmath143 collects the energy of all elements except the first @xmath144 . to see this formally , in the gram - schmidt process the coefficients of the projection of @xmath131 on the subspace spanned by @xmath136 are @xmath145 , and 
 the projection itself is @xmath146 , therefore the innovation is @xmath147 . since @xmath148 and @xmath149 we have @xmath150   \vr v_i \right\|^2 = \left\| \left [ \begin{array}{c } 0 \\ { \mt q_{i}^n}^t \vr x_i \end{array } \right ]   \right\|^2 = \left\|   \vr z_{i}^n 
 \right\|^2 $ ] and similarly , @xmath151 . 
 therefore @xmath152 are independent of @xmath21 and the previous columns of @xmath19 , and can be given by norms over parts of a gaussian i.i.d . 
 vector of length @xmath7 . defining @xmath153 where the equality is due to the independence shown above 
 , we have for any @xmath154 : @xmath155 = \\= e \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{k-1 } \left ( \frac{a_i}{d_i } \right)^{\gamma n } \cdot e \left ( \left . 
 \left ( \frac{a_k}{d_k } \right)^{\gamma n } \right| \mt x_{1}^{k-1 } \right ) \right ] = \\= e \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{k-1 } \left ( \frac{a_i}{d_i } \right)^{\gamma n } \cdot d_k \right ] = e \left ( \prod_{i=1}^{k-1 } \left ( \frac{a_i}{d_i } \right)^{\gamma n } \right ) \cdot d_k\end{gathered}\ ] ] therefore by induction : @xmath156^{\frac{\gamma \cdot n}{2 } } = e \prod_{i=1}^{t } \left ( \frac{a_i}{d_i } \right)^{\gamma n } \stackrel{(\ref{eq : l_prod_induction})}{= } 
 \prod_{i=1}^{t } d_i\ ] ]    now we bound @xmath157 ( using the previously defined gaussian vector @xmath141 ) : @xmath158 where in ( a ) we used independent chi - squared distributed @xmath159 , and in ( b ) we changed variables from @xmath160 to @xmath161 , with inverse transformation @xmath162 and jacobian @xmath163 . 
 the first integral in the expression above evaluates to : @xmath164 by definition of @xmath165 . 
 the second integral behaves like @xmath166 near @xmath167 and like @xmath168 at @xmath169 
 . therefore it will exist ( converge ) iff the power of @xmath170 near @xmath137 is larger than @xmath171 and at @xmath172 is smaller than @xmath171 . 
 the first condition is @xmath173 . 
 the other condition always holds since @xmath174 . note that since the power of @xmath175 is larger by more than 1 than the power of @xmath170 it is positive ( when the first condition holds ) . 
 therefore we can bound :    @xmath176    combining ( [ eq : d_i_derivation ] ) , ( [ eq : w_integral ] ) and ( [ eq : v_integral_bound ] ) we obtain : @xmath177    since @xmath94 results in a rate loss of @xmath178 , and @xmath179 is superexponential in @xmath7 , we would like to express more explicitly the dependence on @xmath7 . using @xmath180 with @xmath181 , @xmath182 
 we can obtain the bound @xmath183 therefore @xmath184 and @xmath185    substituting the above into ( [ eq : chernoff_error_bound ] ) proves lemma [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] for @xmath186 . 
 the two assumptions on the parameters of the problem we have made in order for @xmath94 to be bounded are ( a ) @xmath187 which was needed in order that each new column of @xmath19 would not be spanned by the previous columns and the columns of @xmath21 in probability 1 , and ( b ) @xmath188 , is needed for the existence of @xmath189 . 
 suppose now that @xmath190 . 
 using the cholesky decomposition we can define a coloring matrix @xmath191 , @xmath192 so that @xmath193 and @xmath194 . since by property [ property2 ] the rate function is invariant to a linear transformation of @xmath19 we would have @xmath195 , therefore if lemma [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] holds with respect to the white signal @xmath196 it also holds with respect to @xmath19 . with regard to the assumption that the columns of @xmath21 are linearly independent : if they are not , then the rate function is defined with respect to a smaller matrix @xmath197 containing only the independent columns . comparing with a full rank @xmath21 , the random variables @xmath123 increase ( i.e. @xmath198 ) due to the smaller dimension of @xmath199 , therefore @xmath200 and the lemma still holds 
 * comparison with the siso case : * comparing lemma [ lemma : pairwise_mimo ] with lemma 4 of @xcite for the siso case @xmath201 , which is proven by a direct calculation , the bound here is slightly worse due to the limitation @xmath202 which stems from the use of the chernoff bound . * comparison with mimo capacity : * the scheme above achieves the mutual information of a gaussian mimo channel but not its capacity . 
 achieving the capacity requires adaptation of the input distribution , which for the known awgn channel @xmath30 is performed by svd and water pouring @xcite . 
 the strength of the scheme is in the lack of any assumptions about the probability distribution , which make it applicable for example for non gaussian noise or one that depends on the transmitted signal .    * exploiting temporal correlation : * in the current results , as in previous ones @xcite , the rate function depends on the zero order empirical probability , and lacks the ability to exploit temporal correlation . 
 however the results can be used to exploit such correlation in the siso or mimo channel , in a crude way , by applying the scheme on blocks of @xmath203 channel uses . the rate function over blocks is always superior to the single letter case , and the penalty is an increase in the fixed redundancy .    * using empirical covariance instead of correlation : * when the matrices @xmath204 in ( [ eq : remp_mimo ] ) are replaced with the empirical correlation @xmath205 ( where @xmath206 ) , the derivation is similar , except projection on an additional dimension ( the all - ones vector ) precedes the other projections . 
 the results are the same with a loss of one dimension : @xmath207 and @xmath208 are required , and there is a small variation in @xmath81 .    * 
 the complex mimo channel : * the results easily extend to the _ complex_-valued mimo channel , using the same technique . 
 the main difference is a double number of degrees of freedom in the derivation of @xmath157 , which doubles the rate compared to equation [ eq : remp_mimo ] . 
 * adaptivity : * in @xcite@xcite we presented a communication scheme using a low rate feedback , which dynamically adapts the transmission rate and achieves the rate functions without outage . 
 such schemes are of higher practical interest . 
 it is possible to show that the adaptive scheme of @xcite@xcite achieves @xmath8 of ( [ eq : remp_mimo ] ) up asymptotically vanishing redundancy , and up to a set of @xmath39 sequences having vanishing probability .

75,"the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) is an optimized iterative numerical method . since its development by white in 1992@xcite 
 , this method has achieved tremendous success in studying ground state properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electrons . 
 it has also been successfully extended to finite temperatures@xcite , to momentum space @xcite , and to the calculation of dynamic correlation functions@xcite . 
 the dmrg starts from a small system which can be handled rigourously . a large chain , called superblock , 
 is then built up from this small system by adding a number of sites at a time . at each stage , 
 the superblock consists of system and environment blocks in addition to a number of extra sites . 
 graphically , a superblock can be represented as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the system and environment blocks and @xmath5 and @xmath6 the extra sites added to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( similarly @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) form an augmented block , which becomes the system ( environment ) block in the next iteration . however , in order to keep the size of the superblock basis from growing , the basis for the augmented blocks is truncated . 
 hence the dmrg is a basis truncation method . 
 however , unlike the conventional renormalization group method , the truncation is done for each augmented subblock and the basis states retained are determined not by their energies but by their probabilities projecting onto the ground state ( or other targeted states ) of the superblock . 
 these probabilities are determined by the reduced density matrix of the augmented system ( or environment ) block .    to construct the density matrix , 
 the ground state @xmath7 of the superblock is first diagonalized with the lanczos or other sparse matrix diagonalization algorithm . 
 the reduced density matrix of the augmented system ( or environment ) is defined by tracing out from @xmath8 all the degrees of freedom that do not belong to this block : @xmath9 thus @xmath10 is considered as a statistical bath to the augmented system . 
 the density matrix is semi - positive definite . 
 its eigenvalue is equal to the projection probability of the corresponding eigenvector in @xmath11 , i.e.    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is an eigenpair of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a basis set of @xmath10 . 
 given the density matrix , an entropy can be defined for the augmented system according to the standard thermodynamic relation @xmath16 the maximum of the function @xmath17 is located at @xmath18 . 
 when @xmath19 , @xmath20 increases monotonically with @xmath21 . 
 when @xmath22 , @xmath20 decreases with @xmath21 . 
 no more than two @xmath23 can be larger than @xmath24 since @xmath25 . 
 thus if the contribution to the entropy from the largest @xmath26 is larger than that from the largest discarded eigenvalue of @xmath27 , the dmrg is also a maximum entropy method . 
 there are two approaches in forming a superblock . in literature 
 they are often referred as the finite and infinite lattice approaches . in the infinite lattice approach in one dimension , the environment block is generally chosen as the space reflection of the system . in the finite lattice approach , 
 the size of the superblock is fixed and the environment block is chosen as the remaining part of the lattice for a given system block . 
 the infinite lattice approach allows the size of the superblock to be flexible and can be used to study the thermodynamic limit directly . 
 however , the finite size approach is more accurate in calculating quantities for a system with fixed lattice size . 
 the dmrg can also be used to study thermodynamic properties of a 1d quantum @xcite or 2d classical system@xcite . in this case 
 , the transfer matrix of a hamiltonian system , instead of the hamiltonian itself , is diagonalized . the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities 
 are determined by the maximum eigenvalue of the transfer matrix . 
 the transfer - matrix dmrg method treats directly an infinite lattice system and has therefore no finite lattice size effect . 
 a simple extension of the dmrg to more than 1d would be to replace the single sites added between the blocks with a row of sites , either along a principal axis@xcite or along a diagonal@xcite . 
 however , the extra degrees of freedom added to the system would make the size of the hilbert space prohibitively large . 
 therefore , the two - dimensional algorithm should be developed so that only a single site is added to each subblock at a time .    in practice 
 the extension of the dmrg to more than 1d is to map a higher dimensional lattice onto a 1d one , namely to choose a path to order all lattice sites@xcite . 
 the mapping breaks the lattice symmetry and introduces long range interactions among lattice sites . 
 therefore , the 2d procedure differs from the 1d one in that there are additional connections between the system and environment blocks .    a typical mapping , as illustrated in fig . 
 1 , is to fold a 1d zipper into 2d . 
 this is basically a multi - chain approach since the length of the folded zipper is unlimited but the width is fixed . for a 2d gas of non - interacting electrons , liang and 
 pang found that the number of states needed to maintain a certain accuracy grows exponentially with the width of the lattice @xcite . 
 this convergence was also confirmed for an algorithm where a row of sites was added at each step@xcite . 
 although no proof has been given , this statement is often referred to as most probably valid for any 2d dmrg calculation . 
 this multi - chain approach is simple to implement in the dmrg iteration . 
 however , with this approach , the calculations on @xmath1 and @xmath28 are performed independently . 
 the information obtained from the iterations on a @xmath29 lattice is not used in the preparation of the initial sub - block matrices in the calculation for a @xmath0 lattice . 
 this is undoubtedly a loss of the efficiency . 
 it may result in the loss of the accuracy as well , since the topological characteristics of square lattices is not well manifested in the preparation of the initial block states and the sweeping procedure of dmrg iterations . 
 the momentum space dmrg provides an alternative way to implement the dmrg in two or higher dimensions@xcite . in this representation 
 the momentum is conserved . 
 this leads to a strong restriction on the basis states and allows the number of states kept to increase substantially . unlike its real space counterpart , the momentum space dmrg treats the kinetic energy rigorously . 
 hence this method works better in the weak coupling limit . 
 however , the application of the momentum space dmrg has its own limitations . 
 for example , it is very difficult , if not completely impossible , to apply this method to a pure spin system like the heisenberg model .    in this paper , we introduce a new approach to implement the dmrg in real space in 2d . instead of ordering the lattice sites row by row as in the multi - chain approach , we order the lattice sites by the order along the diagonal direction . 
 as will be shown later , this is a truly two - dimensional method which allows us to build up the initial system and environment of a @xmath30 lattice system based on the results on a @xmath1 lattice and is particularly suitable for handling 2d lattice models . 
 the rest of the paper is arranged as the following . in sec . 
 ii a truly 2d algorithm of the dmrg is introduced . in sec . 
 iii , as an example of the application of the algorithm , the ground state energy of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model is evaluated on both square and triangle lattices . 
 the study is summarized in sec . 
 in this section we will take the square lattice as an example to show how to build up initial blocks of a @xmath0 lattice from a @xmath31 lattice . 
 the extension to any 2d lattice which can be topologically transformed to a square lattice by adding or removing some of the nearest or next nearest neighbor interactions from the square lattice , such as triangle , hexagonal and kagomi lattices ( an example for such a transformation is given in fig . [ triangle ] ) , is straightforward . 
 let us start from a @xmath32 lattice . 
 [ fig3by3]a shows the order of the sites after the @xmath33 mapping . 
 as the system is small , the hamiltonian can be fully diagonalized . 
 [ fig3by3](b ) shows the configuration of the initial superblock for a @xmath34 lattice system . as indicated by the number shown in the figure , 
 the lattice sites are ordered from the lower left corner to the uppper right corner along the diagonal . 
 the initial system contains three sites linked by the solid line in the lower left corner . 
 the initial environment contains all the four sites in the upper right @xmath32 lattice . 
 all the matrix elements for these initial subblocks can be obtained from the results previously obtained on the @xmath35 lattice . 
 we add site @xmath36 to the system and site @xmath37 to the environment to form the augmented system and environment blocks . 
 unlike in a real 1d system , these two added sites are not nearest neighbors in the mapped 1d system . after a standard dmrg calculation for this superblock , 
 the augmented system block can be updated and taken as the new system in the next iteration .    in the next iteration ( fig . 
 [ fig3by3]c ) the system contains four sites ( i.e. sites 1 - 4 ) and the environment contains only three sites at the upper right corner ( i.e. sites 7 - 9 ) . since the two sites ( i.e. sites 5 and 6 ) to be added to the system and environment are nearest neighbors in the mapped 1d lattice , from now on the dmrg finite system sweeping can be done exactly as in a true 1d system . 
 similarly , the dmrg iterations on a @xmath38 lattice can be done based on the results of the @xmath34 lattice . as for a @xmath34 lattice , a @xmath39 lattice ( fig . 
 [ fig4by4]a ) can be formed by two corner cut off @xmath34 lattices with two isolated sites . 
 the initial system contains 6 sites linked by a solid line in the lower left corner ( i.e. sites @xmath40 ) and the initial environment contains @xmath41 sites , also linked by a solid line , in the upper right @xmath34 lattice ( i.e. sites @xmath42 ) . 
 the configurations of these two blocks can be found from the previously studied @xmath34 lattice with or without a space reflection . 
 we add site @xmath43 to the system and site @xmath44 to the environment to form the augmented system and environment blocks . 
 again , these two sites are not nearest neighbors in the mapped 1d system . but the standard dmrg calculation can be done as usual . 
 the augmented system block is then updated and taken as the new system in the next iteration .    in the next iteration ( fig . 
 [ fig4by4]b ) , the augmented system in the last iteration becomes the new system . 
 it contains seven sites ( i.e. sites @xmath45 ) . in this case , since the total number of sites in the environment is also seven , the environment can therefore be taken as the space reflection of the system with respect to the center of the @xmath38 lattice , i.e. sites @xmath46 . 
 all the matrix elements of this environment can be obtained from the space reflection of the system . 
 the sites now added into the system and environment are the two nearest neighboring sites in the mapped 1d system . thus starting from this iteration , the standard finite 
 system sweeping can be done as in a 1d system , without considering how the @xmath38 lattice is constructed from the @xmath34 lattices . 
 the above procedure can be repeated to larger square lattices . in general , the initial superblocks of a @xmath0 lattice can be formed based on the results of the system and environment blocks in a @xmath1 lattice . 
 we order all the lattice sites like a folded zipper with inequal width along the diagonal . 
 if the first site at the lower left corner of the @xmath0 lattice is labeled as 1 , then the two sites to be added in will have the coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the mapped 1d system , respectively . 
 ( an example is given in fig . 
 [ fig5by5 ] for a @xmath49 lattice system . ) 
 we take the first @xmath50 sites in the lower left corner as the initial system and all the sites in the upper right @xmath1 square lattice not used by the system as the initial environment . 
 the dmrg calculation can be done as before . 
 the system is always augmented and updated . at the first few iterations , 
 the site which is added to the environment is fixed at @xmath51 and is not exactly next to @xmath52 in the mapped 1d lattice . 
 this continues until the environment can be generated by the center reflection of the system and the two sites added to these two blocks become nearest neighbors in the mapped 1d system . 
 after that the standard finite system sweeping can be done as in an ordinary 1d lattice . 
 in this section , we take the spin-1/2 heisenberg model as an example to demonstrate how good our approach is compared with the multi - chain approach . 
 the ground state energies on both square and triangle lattices are evaluated . for these 2d systems , there are currently rather precise results available , mainly from large - scale monte carlo calculations and series expansions 
 . therefore the accuracy of our results can be assessed by comparing with these results . 
 the heisenberg model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin operator and the summation runs over all nearest neighbors . in real space at the same parameters and number of states , the truncation error in a system with periodic boundary conditions is usually much higher than with free boundary conditions , therefore we use free boundary conditions .    the total spin @xmath55 is a good quantum number for the isotropic heisenberg model . 
 this symmetry has been used in obtaining all the results presented below . 
 we have also performed finite system iterations using both our algorithm and the multichain one . in the multichain calculations 
 , we have used an algorithm introduced in ref to build up the initial system or environment blocks . 
 table i compares the ground state energy per bond obtained by the true 2d approach , @xmath56 , with that obtained by the multichain approach , @xmath57 , on both square and triangle lattices . for square lattices 
 , @xmath56 is always lower than @xmath57 . 
 since the dmrg satisfies the variational principle , this means that the true 2d results are more accurate than the multichain ones . 
 moreover , the difference @xmath58 increases with increasing lattice . 
 thus the improvement of the true 2d approach over the multichain approach becomes more and more significant as the lattice size is increased . for triangle lattices 
 , @xmath56 is slightly higher than @xmath57 when @xmath59 is small . 
 however , for large lattices @xmath56 is much more accurate than @xmath57 . 
 the increase of @xmath60 with increasing size in the triangle lattice is even larger than in the square one .    for a given @xmath59 , an accurate estimate of the ground state energy ( similarly other physical quantities ) 
 can be obtained by extrapolating @xmath56 to the limit @xmath61 . 
 this can also be done@xcite by extrapolating @xmath56 with respect to the truncation error @xmath62 , since the limit @xmath63 is equivalent to the limit @xmath64 . 
 the extrapolation with respect to the number of retained states is difficult to implement since the asymptotic behavior of @xmath56 in the limit @xmath61 is unknown and there is some uncertainty in determining the function used in the extrapolation . 
 however , we find that the @xmath62 dependence of @xmath56 is generally very simple and can be well described by a power law in the limit @xmath64 . 
 an example is given in fig . 
 [ sqtrunerr ] where the @xmath65 dependence of @xmath56 on a @xmath66 square lattice is shown . in the figure , the solid line is a polynomial fit ( up to the quadratic term in @xmath62 ) to the data . from the fit 
 the ground state energy per bond for this @xmath66 system is estimated to be @xmath67 . 
 for other cases , this fitting procedure can be similarly done .    to obtain the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit 
 , we need to do a finite size scaling for the results obtained from the above extrapolation . in a periodic system , 
 the leading size correction to the ground state energy per bond is of order @xmath68.@xcite however , in an open system as considered here , the finite size effect is stronger and the leading size correction is of order @xmath69 .    figs . 
 ( [ sqeng ] ) and ( [ trieng ] ) show the scaling behavior of the ground state energy on square and triangle lattices , respectively . for the square lattice , 
 the extrapolated ground state energy in the limit @xmath70 is @xmath71 . 
 this agrees very well with the probably best currently available estimate , obtained from large - scale quantum monte carlo calculations , of @xmath72.@xcite the result of spin wave theory is @xmath73 up to the fourth order correction@xcite . for the triangle lattice , 
 the extrapolated result is @xmath74 . 
 it is also consistent with the quantum monte carlo results obtained by capriotti et al @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and by bernu et al@xmath77 , @xmath78 . 
 the second order spin wave result is @xmath79.@xcite    the above comparison indicates that accurate results for the ground state energy can be obtained using the algorithm introduced above . in obtaining these results , the symmetry of the total spin @xmath55 is considered and up to @xmath80 states are retained . this calculation can be readily done on a moderate workstation . with the aid of modern parallel computers 
 , we should be able to keep more number of states ( e.g. @xmath81 states ) and to further increase the accuracy . 
 we have developed a new approach to implement the real space dmrg in 2d . 
 we point out that a @xmath0 lattice can be taken as an assembly of two partially overlapped @xmath1 lattices plus two extra sites and therefore the initial blocks of a @xmath0 system can be built up directly from the blocks of a @xmath82 system . 
 this is a truly 2d algorithm of the dmrg . 
 it preserves a higher degree of the symmetry of 2d lattice than the multichain approach and can be readily used in the dmrg calculation . for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on both square and triangle lattices , 
 the ground state energies obtained with this approach are consistent with the quantum monte carlo results and better than those obtained with the multichain approach for large lattice systems .

76,"magnetic collapse , either being transition from ferromagnetic state to paramagnetic state , or from high spin ( hs ) state to low spin ( ls ) state , under pressure , is a widely observed phenomenon . 
 experiments , such as hyperfine field measurements@xcite , x - ray magnetic dichroism@xcite , nuclear forward scattering@xcite , can have a direct or indirect access to this phenomenon . 
 theoretical calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) were widely adopted to explain and predict it . 
 for example , the hs - ls transition of transition metal monoxides ( e.g. feo , mno , etc . ) under the hydrostatic pressure as high as about 200 gpa were predicted by cohen@xcite . 
 magnetic transition in these highly correlated insulators is the results of competition among the kinetic energy , exchange energy and coulombic repulsion@xcite . 
 the magnetic collapse in metals on the other hand can be qualitatively understood with the help of the stoner model : in a simplified version of this model , a magnetic state is stable if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the stoner parameter , which is weakly dependent on the atomic distance , while @xmath8 , the density of states at the fermi level , decreases as the band width increases under the pressure . at a certain critical pressure , the criterion is no longer satisfied , then the ferromagnetism can not be sustainable . 
 the magnetic moment collapse is highly expectable in zrfe@xmath0 under pressure when we compare the three isostructure compounds : yco@xmath0 , zrfe@xmath0 , and yfe@xmath0 , which have 93 , 92 , and 91 electrons , respectively . 
 yco@xmath0 is metamagnetic , while yfe@xmath0 is ferromagnetic with magnetic moments about 2.90 @xmath9 . 
 experiments towards this direction are not carried out according to our best knowledge . 
 here we approach it by calculations based on density functional theory . 
 magnetism was proposed to be entangled with the invar effect , where the material shows almost zero temperature dependence of the volume in a certain temperature region . 
 the invar effect is related to the magnetic collapse by the fact that the thermal expansion of the lattice can be ( partly ) compensated by the decrease of the lattice constant induced by the decrease of the magnetic moment at the same time@xcite .    as an invar alloy , together with other interesting properties , zrfe@xmath0 and its doped versions were investigated by many researchers . 
 shiga@xcite reported the experimental evidence of the invar effect in laves phase intermetallic compounds , giving the spontaneous volume magnetostriction @xmath10 in zrfe@xmath0 being 0.01 . 
 the @xmath10 is defined in terms of the ratio of the equilibrium volumes in the ferromagnetic fm ( v@xmath11 ) and the paramagnetic pm state ( v@xmath12 ) @xmath13 the pressure dependence of the curie temperature(t@xmath14 ) was measured by brouha@xcite . 
 t@xmath14 was reported to be around 625 k at the ambient pressure . 
 a negative @xmath15 up to hydrostatic pressure of 35 kbar showed the characteristics of the strong ferromagnetism , as they proposed , in which only one spin subband is fully occupied . 
 the pressure dependence of the hyperfine field ( h@xmath16 ) at the fe site of zrfe@xmath0 was measured up to 0.8 gpa by dumelow@xcite . 
 the value of @xmath17 was @xmath18/kbar . 
 the total magnetic moment in zrfe@xmath0 were measured by two authors as summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] . 
 klein @xcite _ et al . 
 _ discussed the electronic structure , superconductivity , and magnetism in zrx@xmath0 ( x = v , fe , co ) with the c15 structures . 
 their results show that the stoner theory is quantitatively inaccurate in these compounds because there is a significant covalent bonding . 
 this bonding mechanism in zrfe@xmath0 was proposed by mohn@xcite . 
 the consequence of this bonding is that the weights of doss of the majority and minority electrons also changes , rather than only a rigid shift of the subbands . 
 the tiny energy difference between the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic state at small lattices in their calculation has already indicated the magnetic collapse in zrfe@xmath0 under pressure , but no detailed information about the magnetic transition was given there@xcite . 
 recently , the laves - phase alloy ( zr , nb)fe@xmath0 was re - examined by mohn@xcite , where the connection of invar with magnetic moment frustration were disentangled .    in this work , 
 we investigate the magnetic behavior of zrfe@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressures by dft . 
 we show that the magnetic moment evolution envolves three steps : a continuous transition from a high spin ( hs ) state to a low spin ( ls ) state , followed by a discontinuous decrease to a metastable state ( ms ) , and finally arriving at a nonmagnetic ( nm ) state under successively increasing the pressure up to 26.0 gpa . 
 zrfe@xmath0 crystalizes in the c15 ( space group f@xmath19 ) structure laves phase with two formula units per face centered cubic unit cell . 
 the full - potential local orbital minimum basis band structure code ( fplo)@xcite was used in our calculation . the local spin density approximation of perdew - wang 92@xcite was adapted here . 
 the number of k - points in the full brillouin zone is @xmath20 , which can guarantee the convergence of the total energy to microhartree . 
 both scalar relativistic and full - relativistic treatment were conducted and the results are compared . the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) 
 calculations were used to investigate the possible multiple local energy minima with respect to the magnetic moment . 
 the calculated properties and their comparison with the experimental and other theoretical ones are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] . 
 .[tab : table1 ] the calculated parameters of the cubic laves phase zrfe@xmath0 compared with the experimental ones . 
 the values without references are obtained in this work . [ cols=""<,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     our theoretical lattice constant ( 0.685 nm ) by the scalar relativistic calculation is about 3% smaller than the experimental ones ( 0.706 nm by warren@xcite , 0.707 nm by yamada @xcite ) . 
 however , it is within the systematic error of l(s)da , which usually underestimates the lattice constant@xcite . 
 the total magnetic moment obtained at the theoretical lattice is 3.06 @xmath9 , which is quite deviated from the experimental ones , while the calculation using the experimental lattice constants gives acceptable total magnetic moments of 3.14@xmath9 by the full - relativistic calculations . 
 the orbital moment of fe atom is 0.054 @xmath1 , and zr 0.008 @xmath1 which compensates parts of the spin moment in the scalar relativistic case where the total spin moment are 2.60 @xmath9 and 3.07 @xmath9 at these two lattice constant , respectively . at equilibrium the body modulus and its derivative with respect to the pressure at the hs state are @xmath21 gpa and @xmath22 respectively by fitting the _ e - v _ curve to the birch - murnaghan 3rd order equation of state ( eos)@xcite . 
 the bulk modulus given by different fitting schemes , such as cubic polynomial , gives deviations of @xmath232 gpa from the present value . 
 the nm state gives @xmath24 gpa and @xmath25 , respectively . 
 after projecting the magnetic moment on different orbitals , we can observe that the 3d electrons of the two irons contribute about 4.08 @xmath1 to the total magnetic moment . 
 other orbitals have negative contributions . 
 the magnetic moment of zr consists of -0.4 @xmath1 from the 4d electrons and -0.15 @xmath1 from the 4sp electrons . 
 this population analysis is in agreement with the previous results by mohn@xcite , who shows that there were diffusive negative moment background , which were from the d electrons , as well as the sp electrons . 
 ( color online ) the magnetic moment evolution with the lattice constants . 
 the experimental lattice constant is indicated by the solid vertical line , while the theoretical one by the dashed line . 
 the inset gives the pressure - lattice relation of the three different states . ]    the enthalpy differences between the _ ls _ and _ ms _ states , and _ 
 ms _ and _ nm _ states under the pressure . 
 the pressure is zero at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant in this figure . 
 the pressure at the experimental equilibrium lattice is about -3 gpa . ] 
 the variation of total magnetic moment with the lattice constants is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mom - lat ] . 
 the corresponding hydrostatic pressures of different magnetic states are shown in the inset and also in the upper abscissa . 
 very obviously , the magnetic moment decreases continuously from the larger value of 3.14 @xmath1 at @xmath26 nm to the smaller of 1.5 @xmath1 at @xmath27 nm , corresponding to a hydrostatic pressure about 3.6 gpa . 
 the pressure is calculated by taken the difference of the pressure at experimental lattice constant and the one considered . 
 further compression of the lattice to about 0.657 nm , a metastable state ( ms ) is initiated with the magnetic moment about 0.5 @xmath1 under the pressure about 6.0 gpa . 
 continuous decreasing the lattice to about 0.637 nm results that the ls state disappears . 
 the phase transition can be shown by taken the differences of the enthalpy between the corresponding states . 
 as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : enthapy ] , ls to ms transition takes places at 11.9 gpa , and ms to nm at 12.3 gpa . 
 total magnetic moment collapses at @xmath28 around 0.630 nm . 
 the softening of the lattice due to the magnetism can be observed in the p - v curve in the inset of fig . 
 [ fig : mom - lat ] . 
 the rather small magnetic moment about 0.2@xmath1/f.u . at the metastable state 
 can possibly be suppressed by quantum fluctuation . 
 thus we anticipate a quantum phase transition of first order under pressure . when the magnetic moment disappears , superconductivity may be observed . 
 this can be quite interesting , because according to our estimation the required pressure is about 15 gpa , which is readily available by the experiments . 
 ( color online)the total doss and partial doss at different lattice constants . from ( a ) to ( d ) , the lattice constants are 7.08 , 6.85 , 6.80 , and 6.70  , respectively . 
 the sign of the coordinate indicates the doss of the majority(+ ) and minority(- ) spins . in ( a ) , 
 the partial doss of fe and zr are also shown . ] 
 the electronic origin of the magnetic moment behavior under the pressure can be explored by the doss . according to fig . 
 [ fig : dos ] ( a@xmath29d ) , which show the dos evolution with the lattice constants , the relative shift of the doss of the up and down spins is the reason for the decrease of the magnetic moment : the doss of the up spin electrons shift to higher energy while those of the down spin electrons shift to the lower energy when the lattice constant is reduced from ( a ) to ( d ) . 
 the shape of the doss near the fermi level ( e@xmath30 ) determines whether the magnetism collapses gradually or sharply . from fig . 
 [ fig : dos](a ) , it is observable that at the experimental lattice constant the doss of the up spin , contributed mainly from the iron , has a gradual increase below the fermi level , while the dos of the down spin has a wide band dip about 0.8 ev below it and a sharp increase just above it . 
 the majority states of the fe and zr resonate above e@xmath30 , but the minority resonates below e@xmath30 . 
 this is the consequence of the covalent bonding . 
 thus an antiferromagnetic coupling between fe and zr is induced . 
 applying the pressure will broaden the bandwidth due to the increase of the overlapping between the orbitals . 
 this decreases the majority spin population while increases the minority spin electrons in order to conserve the total electron number . 
 this process of gradual decrease of the magnetic moment is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mom - lat ] , when the lattice constant is larger than 6.85  . 
 the decrease of the magnetic moment results in the decrease of the exchange field which is proportional to the magnetic moment . 
 thus the exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin is reduced . 
 this shifts the high peak of the down spin nonbonding bands downward . 
 when the fermi level passes through the high dos peak of the minority spins ( fig . 
 3(c ) ) , the magnetic moment is rapidly reduced , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mom - lat ] , when the lattice constant is between 6.85 and 6.72  . 
 the occurrence of the ms state when a is between 6.32 and 6.58 is due to the details of the doss . 
 it is impossible to give an argument without calculations , but one thing is essential : a narrow peak around the fermi level , so that the multiple magnetic solutions can exist@xcite . in this lattice region , 
 the material becomes weak ferromagnetism , with rather small magnetic moment : 0.1  @xmath1/fe . 
 more than twenty different models have been published in the past half century for understanding the invar offect . 
 a general review about the invar can be found , for example , in the handbook edited by buschow and wohlfarth@xcite and references therein . 
 one model called 2@xmath31-model is based on the hypothesis of weiss that there exist two separated energy minima with different volumes and magnetic states : hs - high - volume and ls - low - volume states . 
 first principle calculations by entel@xcite and other authors supported this proposal . 
 they argued that the special position of the fermi level in the minority band , being at the crossover between nonbonding and antibonding states , is responsible for the tendency of most invar systems to undergo martensitic phase transition . 
 the hs - ls transition can also be continuous as proposed in this work in the cubic phase zrfe@xmath0 , according to our calculation . 
 the thermal excitation will cause the majority spins in the antibonding states flips to the minority nonbonding states . 
 increasing temperature , therefore , leads to a gradual loss of the spontaneous volume expansion associated with the ferromagnetic state . 
 this gradual process , contrary to the hs to ls in some invar ( e.g. fe@xmath32pt ) , will not cause any discontinuity in the pressure dependence of physical properties , which , to our knowledge , has not been observed experimentally . 
 if we follow this , and estimate the magnetovolume coupling constant @xmath33 by fitting the data around the transition region ( a@xmath34=6.7@xmath296.85  ) to @xmath35 , @xmath36 is obtained , which is comparable with the experimental value @xcite @xmath37 . 
 the overshooting of the spontaneous volume magnetostriction ( @xmath10 ) and the underestimation of the magnetovolume coupling constant can partly because of the nonvanishing local magnetic moment above the transition temperature . 
 in summary , we have shown that the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment in the cubic phase zrfe@xmath0 and elucidated it by the variation of the doss . 
 the magnetic moment undergoes continuous transition from high spin state(3.14  @xmath9 ) to low spin state ( 1.26  @xmath9 ) at the hydrostatic pressure of 3.6 gpa , and further to lower spin state ( 0.5  @xmath9 ) at about 14.9 gpa . 
 the total magnetic moment collapses at the pressure about 15.3 gpa . 
 we suggest that the invar effect in this compound can be qualitatively understood by the spin flip transition due to the thermal excitation . 
 we would also like to intrigue the experimentalist to investigate their volume ( pressure ) dependence of the magnetic and transport properties where the pressure are reachable in laboratories .

77,"while there has been much debate about the exact nature of the quantum state , the most persuasive interpretation is that the state represents the knowledge or belief of an observer about a given quantum system . using the state , 
 the observer can assign probabilities to the outcomes of any possible measurement of the system . from this point of view , a pure state represents a state of maximal knowledge ( or minimal ignorance ) about a system , and a mixed state represents a description with incomplete knowledge . 
 whether the state also reflects the structure of an underlying physical reality is a subject of heated debate ; but at a practical level , we make state assignments based on our available information . 
 if the state assignment reflects the information of an observer , it follows reasonably that two observers with different information will make different state assignments . 
 this can arise naturally in a number of ways ; for example , one observer may have access to certain measurement outcomes that another observer does not , or may have additional information about how the system was prepared . in @xcite 
 this question was examined , and a necessary and sufficient condition was found which must be satisfied by any two or more state assignments which reflect differing information about the same physical system , provided that the information underlying all of these assignments is accurate and reliable . 
 classically , the state of knowledge about a system is described by a probability distribution . 
 new information about the system can be acquired by performing a measurement , and updating the state assignment based on a measurement result is done using the bayes rule . 
 classically , two probability distributions can be compatible so long as they are not actually contradictory . 
 furthermore , it is possible to pool the information of different observers using only their individual states of knowledge ( probability distributions ) , _ provided _ that the information of different observers is independent . in this case 
 , other information ( such as how the knowledge was obtained ) is not required . 
 a reasonable question is whether similar conditions hold in quantum mechanics . 
 can we take the state assignment to reflect all information about a quantum system ? 
 if so , under what conditions ? 
 what assumptions do we have to make about how the information underlying the state assignments was acquired ?    in this paper , we look at different ways that a state can be derived from underlying information , and show that in general the state assignment does not completely summarize all the information used to derive it . 
 in particular , we consider two significantly different ways of constructing the state . in the first case , 
 the information is derived from measurement . 
 each party obtains his or her information by making a measurement . in the second case , 
 each observer is given _ classical _ information about how the system was prepared , for example from the third party who prepared it . 
 the method of pooling information becomes clear once we know how the information was obtained , but different types of information can result in very different ways of acquiring a joint state assignment . 
 however , this does not rule out the possibility that within a very sharply defined context , it may be possible and useful to both define reasonable measures of compatibility , and give rules for for pooling state assignments 
 .    there have been various studies concerning compatibility of state assignments and pooling of information @xcite . 
 quite recently , the authors in ref . 
 @xcite used the conditional states formalism @xcite to show that earlier results @xcite can be recast in this more general formalism . 
 our results differs from theirs in that the main focus of this paper is an attempt to _ quantify _ the degree of compatibility in the assigned quantum states . 
 we also note that the problem of pooling information , so that a unique joint state assignment can be derived , is very sensitive to the type of information used to make the state assignment in the first place , and illustrate this with a couple of representative examples .    in sec . 
 [ sec2 ] , we briefly describe the necessary and sufficient condition for two different states to be compatible . 
 we discuss the possible existence of a compatibility measure ( or measures ) that quantifies how much the two states are compatible . in sec . 
 [ sec3 ] , we show two significantly different ways of obtaining the state assignment , and argue that the state does not encapsulate the whole information in general . in sec . 
 [ smr ] , we explore a particular compatibility measure , and show that this measure is actually a distance measure between two states , while in sec . 
 [ sec5 ] we show how if we assume that the state assignments were derived from a particular type of measurement , there is a simple rule for forming a joint state assignment . in sec . 
 [ sdp_sec ] we extend this measure to compatibility of states for @xmath0 observers , and show that it is the solution of a semidefinite program ; we then define similar compatibility measures for two more restrictive notions of compatibility , post - peierls ( pp ) and equal support ( es ) compatibility . 
 we conclude the paper in sec . 
 [ sec7 ] . 
 it seems necessary to make a bit more concrete what we mean when we talk about different observers have different _ information _ about a given system . 
 what , exactly , do we mean by information in this context ?    for clarity , we will draw somewhat arbitrary distinctions between _ information _ , _ knowledge _ , and _ 
 belief_. when does it make sense even to talk about compatibility and state pooling ? 
 arguably , two observers will only have a basis for comparison between their state assignments if they start from a fairly substantial base of shared knowledge about the system . 
 for example , the two observers might both know that the give system was prepared by a given type of experimental apparatus , or by performing a particular generalized measurement . 
 this would represent their shared knowledge base about the system . 
 given that shared knowledge , the two observers might still have different _ information _ about the system . 
 for instance , they might each have partial , but different , information about the settings of the device that prepared the system ; or they might each have partial , but different , information about the outcome of the generalized measurement . 
 when we refer to _ information _ in the discussion that follows , we will mostly be using it in this rather restrictive sense  that is , some amount of numerical data about the system , or more generally , a probability distribution over such data . 
 if the two observers do not have a shared knowledge base then it becomes harder to compare their state assignments , or for such comparisons to even make sense . 
 if two observers think that the system was prepared in radically different ways , then it is hard to see how they could share their knowledge , even if their state assignments were almost identical . 
 this is where knowledge shades over into belief . 
 a number of authors have pointed out that two observers in possession of the same facts might nevertheless arrive at quite different state assignments if they have different _ prior distributions _ or _ priors_. ( see , for example , @xcite . )    in most discussions of compatibility  including that in this paper  we are implicitly assuming that the observers with compatible state assignments begin with identical ( or very similar ) priors about the system , and a strong base of shared knowledge . 
 their state assignments differ due to the acquisition of different data about the system . 
 while there is certainly no necessity that different observers should start from the same prior  quite the contrary  in practice , it is quite common in science for observers to come to consensus about particular experimental systems , generally by sharing large amounts of data from repeated trials or preparations . 
 it would be interesting to study the idea of compatibility for observers with different priors , and in particular the process whereby consensus can be reached , but that is beyond the scope of the current paper . 
 let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two different assignments of density matrix to the same system . if we assume that these assignments were made by two observers with different information , what restriction does this place on the state assignments ? 
 we call two states that satisfy such a restriction _ compatible_. a necessary and sufficient criterion @xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be compatible is that _ the intersection of their supports _ is nonempty : @xmath3 to show that this condition is necessary , we assume that the information used to derive state descriptions @xmath1 and @xmath2 is _ accurate and reliable_. the two observers should then be able to combine their information to produce a joint state description @xmath4 . since their information is accurate and reliable , any measurement result which is ruled out ( i.e. , assigned zero probability ) by either party should also be ruled out in the joint state @xmath4 
 . this then implies    ( _ a ) , & ( _ b ) ( _ ab ) + & \{(_a),(_b)}(_ab ) + & ( _ ab)(_a)(_b ) .    sufficiency is proven by constructing an explicit situation in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 could arise as state estimates by two observers making different measurements . 
 we introduce purifications of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with two ancillas , and then combine them into a single state . 
 the given state then results from alice and bob each measuring his or her own ancilla and getting a particular outcome . 
 see @xcite for details . 
 the compatibility criterion in eq . 
 ( [ compatibility ] ) is robust against sufficiently small distortions of the states . 
 for example , given @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the two states remain compatible until @xmath7 . 
 unfortunately , it is in some ways not very informative . 
 the criterion is an all - or - nothing property ; it says only that two state assignments _ could _ 
 result from observers with differing information , but gives no clue how likely it is that they did . 
 this makes it natural to seek a measure of compatibility that would indicate this likelihood . 
 the measure would be zero for incompatible states , and go up to one for identical states . 
 we discuss the possibility of such measures in secs . 
 [ smr ] and [ sdp_sec ] . 
 we note that other ( more restrictive ) notions of compatibility also exist : see ref . 
 @xcite for an extensive discussion of this subject and a variety of different compatibility criteria . 
 we briefly look at two of these other criteria in sec . 
 [ sdp_sec ] . 
 we think of the state assignment as being based on information possessed by the observer ; but information can come in many different forms . in this paper , we consider two different types of information in particular : classical information about the state preparation , in which the state assignment is made using the _ maximum entropy estimate _ , and information derived from measurements .      if an observer acquires classical information about the way a system was prepared , he or she can make a state assignment based on the _ maximum entropy principle _ 
 @xcite : choosing the state with the highest entropy consistent with the given information . 
 this takes a particularly simple form if the information is in the form of an expectation value @xmath8 . 
 the observer can construct a state assignment by maximizing the von  neumann entropy @xmath9 under the following two constraints :    [ constrain ] f ( ) & \ { } = o + g ( ) & \ { } = 1 . 
 this is a constrained maximization problem , and can be solved with lagrange multipliers : @xmath10 the estimated state is @xmath11 where we can solve for @xmath12 and @xmath13 from ( [ constrain ] ) . 
 this assignment is obviously based on the observer s knowledge ; further information can alter the assignment . 
 if an additional piece of information @xmath14 is given , the state changes accordingly : @xmath15 if alice and bob wish to form a joint state assignment , they must share all the information they have about the state preparation and perform a maximum entropy assignment with this shared information . 
 it is easy to see that as long as all the information provided to alice and bob is consistent  that is , that there exists a state with all those expectation values  their state assignments will be compatible . moreover , the entropy of the joint state @xmath4 must be less than or equal to the entropies of the individual states : @xmath16 and @xmath17 . 
 consider now a different situation . 
 suppose that alice and bob share two halves of an entangled state , which we write in the schmidt decomposition : @xmath18 with @xmath19 . 
 alice has the reduced state @xmath20 which can accurately predict the probabilities for any measurement she makes . 
 suppose bob makes a measurement in the basis @xmath21 , and gets outcome @xmath0 . 
 then alice s state should immediately become @xmath22 . 
 she can not , however , update her state until she learns the outcome of bob s measurement . until that point , 
 her original state assignment @xmath1 is the best she can make .      as mentioned in sec . 
 1 , the state itself does not always include all the information an observer has about a system . for information acquired from measurements , 
 this was shown by jacobs @xcite , who demonstrated that if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are compatible state assignments , which are assumed to be obtained from the results of measurements by alice and bob , then it is possible to construct an initial state and choice of measurement such that the joint state assignment @xmath4 can be _ any _ density matrix at all , so long as @xmath23 . 
 thus , in general more information is needed than @xmath1 and @xmath2 in order to construct @xmath4 ; @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not encapsulate all of alice and bob s information about the system . 
 here we give another example showing that the same is true if alice and bob make their state assignments using classical information and the maximum entropy principle . 
 suppose alice assigns the state of a qubit : @xmath24 where @xmath25 . 
 this same state can be obtained from classical information in many ways . here 
 are two examples :    &  a+b = a^2+b^2 ,   = c + &  b+c = b^2+c^2 ,   = a.    suppose that bob makes his state assignment @xmath26 based on the classical information that @xmath27 . 
 we can readily see that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are compatible . 
 ( indeed , any two qubit states are compatible unless they are two distinct pure state assignments . ) 
 now suppose that alice and bob share their information to obtain a joint state assignment @xmath4 . 
 the joint state in cases 1 and 2 will be different :    &   _ ab = ( + ( a+b(b - d)/a)+d+c)/2 + &   _ ab = ( + a+d+(c+b(b - d)/c))/2 . 
 this shows that knowledge of the state assignments @xmath1 and @xmath2 alone is not sufficient to know how to pool information in the case where the information is classical , as well . 
 the state assignment does not encapsulate all information about the system . 
 the compatibility criterion of @xcite is all - or - nothing : either two states are compatible , or they are not . 
 this includes extreme examples like @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for any @xmath30 these states 
 are compatible , even though they are practically orthogonal for very small @xmath31 . 
 this leads to the natural question : can we define _ measures _ of compatibility ? 
 intuitively , while compatibility indicates that two state assignments _ could _ represent different information about the same system , such a measure would represent a probability that they actually _ do_. we should therefore expect the measure to go from 0 for incompatible states to 1 for identical states , with some kind of smooth behavior in between .    from our earlier discussion , 
 some caveats are clearly needed . 
 since the states do not represent all information about the system , it is impossible to _ truly _ measure the compatibility based on the state assignments alone . 
 for example , it is impossible to arrive at compatible state assignments using classical information which is contradictory ; e.g. , the two pieces of classical information @xmath32 and @xmath33 lead to compatible state assignments for a qubit , but are obviously inconsistent with each other . 
 ( this inconsistency comes from the assumptions of the maximum entropy procedure , where these expected values are taken to be guaranteed properties of the state . ) therefore , in defining a compatibility measure , one must implicitly assume that the state assignments represent information which was acquired in a consistent manner 
 for example , by alice and bob performing measurements on the same system . 
 one such measure was proposed by poulin and blume - kohout , in close analogy with the measure of distance between classical probability distributions @xcite . 
 the correct interpretation of this measure is not exactly clear in the quantum case , but it does have the right sort of qualitative behavior , and reduces to a known measure in the case of essentially classical state ( i.e. , when @xmath1 and @xmath2 commute ) . 
 in other cases , however , it is somewhat difficult to compute , since it requires taking a minimum over all pure state decompositions of density matrices .    here 
 we examine a different compatibility measure , which was originally suggested by kitaev @xcite . 
 the original idea is to find a positive matrix @xmath34 that `` fits '' into both the state matrix @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the greatest degree possible . 
 let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be compatible states . consider all positive matrices @xmath35 such that    [ mr ] _ a-&0 , + _ b-&0 . 
 the compatibility measure @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37    we have found no simple formula for this measure , in general . 
 ( in sec .  [ sdp_sec ] 
 we show that this value can be found as the solution of a semidefinite program . ) 
 however , it is possible to upper bound @xmath38 with the _ trace distance _ between @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the trace distance : @xmath41 to see this inequality , define @xmath42 . 
 we can rewrite eqs . 
 ( [ mr ] ) and ( [ kitaevmeasure ] ) in terms of @xmath43 :    [ mr1 ] & 0 , + _ b-_a+ & 0 , + _ a - & 0 ,    and @xmath44 this just rewrites the original definition of the measure in terms of the new operator @xmath43 . 
 however , we can put an upper bound on this quantity by relaxing the third requirement above that @xmath45 . in this case 
 , we can find an exact expression for ( [ bound ] ) . from @xcite , we know that @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are positive operators with orthogonal support . 
 this implies that @xmath50 
 . we can satisfy ( [ mr1 ] ) and minimize @xmath51 by choosing @xmath52 then @xmath53    it is easy to see that this measure has the right qualitative behavior for a measure of compatibility : it goes from @xmath54 for incompatible states ( where , in general , the above bound will be nonzero unless the states are actually orthogonal ) to @xmath55 for identical states ( at which point it will agree with the above bound ) . 
 we will now show a couple of examples of this compatibility measure for states of qubits , in which the information which produces the state assignment is either classical information about the preparation , or the results of measurements . for our first example , suppose that charlie prepares the pure state @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . 
 define an hermitian operator @xmath59 . 
 charlie gives the expectation values @xmath60 to alice , and @xmath61 to bob . 
 alice and bob s state estimates are , respectively , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . 
 the measure @xmath38 is then    k(_a,_b ) & = 1- + & = 1-(/2 ) . 
 this expression obviously depends both on charlie s choice of state and his choice of observables to pass on to alice and bob . 
 if we average this over all possible pure states , then we get a simple result which depends only on the choice of observable :    k_a , b&=_=11-(/2 ) + & = 1 - ( 1/3)(/2 ) . 
 we plot this in fig . 
 [ fig : me ] . 
 the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 become identical when @xmath65 , and therefore are perfectly compatible .     versus angle @xmath66,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our second example , the information comes from measurement . 
 assume that the initial state is unknown to alice and bob , so that they assume a completely mixed state . 
 that is , @xmath67 alice performs projective measurement @xmath68 with outcome @xmath54 and @xmath55 , a_0= ,   a_1= , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for @xmath71 
 this is a @xmath72 measurement ; for @xmath73 it is an @xmath74 measurement . 
 bob also performs a projective measurement of @xmath74 : b_0= ,   b_1= . 
 however , as in the paper of jacobs @xcite , we assume that alice and bob do nt know the order of their measurements , and that they each know only the outcomes of their own measurements . 
 their state estimates are thus    _ a^i=_j=0 
 ^ 1,p_i=_j=0 ^ 1p_ij + _ b^j=_i=0 ^ 1,p_j=_i=0 ^ 1p_ij +    where @xmath75 . 
 let @xmath76 , and @xmath77=\sum_{i , j}p_{ij}k_{i , j}$ ] . shown in fig . ( 
 [ fig : mm.eps ] ) is the compatibility measure @xmath78 versus the angle @xmath66 , where the compatibility measure saturates when @xmath73 .     versus angle @xmath66,scaledwidth=50.0% ] 
 one caveat should be inserted here . 
 when the degree of compatibility is high , this implies that alice and bob each have information that leads to almost the same state assignment . 
 this might lead one to think that when the degree of compatibility is low , their information is only marginally consistent . but 
 this need not be the case . consider the example given in eq . 
 ( [ reduced_alice ] ) . 
 while alice s and bob s state assignments are guaranteed to be compatible , it is possible for their degree of compatibility to be quite low  particularly if bob makes a measurement with many possible outcomes . 
 but their information is clearly perfectly consistent ; alice merely lacks one piece of data possessed by bob . 
 as we will see in the next section , this compatibility measure has a natural interpretation in terms of a particular method for gathering information , which also leads to a natural rule for pooling states . 
 kurt jacobs showed @xcite that one can construct different measurement situations  that is , initial states , choices of measurement , and measurement outcomes  which yield @xmath1 and @xmath2 when alice and bob each have only partial knowledge of the outcomes , but that upon sharing information will produce any state @xmath4 at all , so long as the support of @xmath4 is in the intersection of the supports of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 given only @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the problem of determining @xmath4information pooling  is not uniquely solvable . 
 however , if we make particular assumptions about the type of measurement used to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we can single out a particular state @xmath4 , by choosing the measurement which maximizes the probability of the outcome yielding @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 this probability turns out to be essentially identical to the compatibility measure @xmath38 . 
 assume that alice and bob have no information regarding the quantum system , then the density matrix @xmath79 is maximally mixed , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the dimension of the state space . 
 alice and bob carry out some joint measurement @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , and alice gets result @xmath84 while bob gets result @xmath0 . then @xmath85 given fixed states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , consider all measurements which yield @xmath1 and @xmath2 for some pair of outcome of @xmath84 and @xmath0 . 
 we will show that the particular measurement that maximizes the probability of @xmath4 is the positive matrix that satisfies ( [ mr ] ) . 
 this gives a particular interpretation for the compatibility measure defined in section 4 . 
 for simplicity , we start by considering only positive measurement operators , @xmath86 we can lump together all the measurement outcomes other than the `` correct '' one ( i.e. , the one that is assumed to actually occur ) , so we can restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and @xmath89 without loss of generality , we assume that the outcome @xmath90 is the case of interest 
 . then we can rewrite ( [ pool1 ] ) as    [ pool2 ] _ a & = , + _ b & = , + _ ab & = .    let @xmath91 , @xmath92 . 
 we want to make @xmath93 as large as possible while keeping @xmath1 and @xmath2 fixed and having @xmath94 all still positive . 
 this corresponds to the measurement for which the particular outcomes @xmath90 are most probable . 
 assume first that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant and @xmath97 . 
 note that [ supp ] supp()()=. otherwise , we can always move the intersection part to @xmath98 to make the above statement true . 
 since    [ ine ] &  _ 
 a- r 0 , + &  _ 
 b- r 0 , +    together with ( [ supp ] ) , implies that @xmath99 thus , the constant @xmath96 is chosen to equal to @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and matrix @xmath102 . 
 we have one last requirement @xmath103 from that , we can choose @xmath96 to be the largest value such that @xmath104 . from the solution for @xmath34 in section 4 , we see that @xmath105 the probability of @xmath90 outcome is then @xmath106    we now show that the probability of @xmath90 outcome will be maximized if @xmath107 is as large as possible within the constraints given by ( [ mr ] ) . 
 consider a different positive operator @xmath108 that satisfies    -0 , + _ a-0 , + _ b-0 .    defining @xmath109 retains the positivity of @xmath110 , while the probability of @xmath90 outcome becomes @xmath111 so to maximize the probability of the @xmath90 outcome , we must choose @xmath107 as large as possible subject to the constraints of ( [ mr ] ) . 
 this concludes our proof . the combined density matrix will then be @xmath112 , and the probability of the outcome will be @xmath113 where @xmath96 is given in ( [ valc ] ) . 
 we have shown that we can actually find the particular measurement such that when two parties pool their information , the probability of the joint outcome is maximized . 
 note , however , that this required us to make very particular assumptions about the initial state ( maximally mixed  the state of maximal ignorance ) and the type of measurements that were done ( positive measurement operators ) . with a different initial state or more general measurements , this result 
 need not have held . 
 such assumptions must always be made to justify a particular choice of compatibility measure and information pooling procedure . 
 the measure of state compatibility in sec .  [ smr ] was defined for two states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 this can be generalized to a set of @xmath0 states , @xmath114 , by defining the compatibility of the set @xmath115 , @xmath116 , to be the value obtained from the following optimization : @xmath117,\\ \label{k state bfm } \textrm{subject to : } & r\leq\rho_i , \ 
 1\leq i\leq k;\quad r \geq 0 . \end{split}\end{aligned}\ ] ] while no simple formula is known for this measure for any number of states @xmath0 , the optimizations in eqs . 
 ( [ mr ] , [ k state bfm ] ) are examples of a general class of problems called _ semidefinite programs _ ( sdps ) @xcite . 
 these are efficiently numerically solvable ( e.g. , using @xcite ) .    within the sdp formalism , for a given problem it is possible to construct a related dual problem ( see appendix [ sdp appendix ] for an outline of how to do so ) . for the sdp in eq . 
 ( [ k state bfm ] ) this dual problem is @xmath118 , \\ 
 \textrm{subject to : } & \sum_{i=1}^{k}m_i\geq \mathbb{i } ; \quad m_i\geq0,\   \forall i. \end{split}\end{aligned}\ ] ] any feasible solution to this dual sdp upper - bounds @xmath116 due to the property of weak duality that all sdps obey . 
 furthermore , the two optimal solutions will be equal . 
 ( this can be shown using slater s theorem . ) 
 note that the set @xmath119 resembles a measurement , except that it is required to sum to _ more _ than the identity in the sdp s constraints 
 . it would be interesting if there was an operational interpretation of this .      the sdps given in eqs . 
 ( [ k state bfm ] ) and ( [ k state bfm dual ] ) are similar in form to an sdp found in @xcite where the task of _ state exclusion _ is addressed . 
 state exclusion asks : given a system prepared in an unknown state from a given set @xmath114 , when is it possible to perform a measurement on the unknown state to conclusively rule out one of the preparations ? if it is not possible , how small an error can one make when attempting to exclude a preparation by performing a measurement ? 
 the task of state exclusion can be regarded as encapsulating another compatibility criteria , that of _ post - peierls _ ( pp ) compatibility @xcite . for a set of states to be compatible in the pp sense , 
 for any measurement that could be performed , there should exist at least one outcome that would occur with non - zero probability for all states in the set . 
 hence , if state exclusion is possible , the set of states is pp incompatible . 
 how small an error it is possible to make when attempting to exclude a state gives a measure of the set s pp compatibility . 
 we can use the sdp from @xcite to define a measure @xmath120 of pp compatibility for a set @xmath115 , as the result of the following optimization :    the pp compatibility of a set @xmath115 , @xmath120 , is defined as : @xmath121 , \\ 
 \textrm{subject to : } & n\leq { \rho}_i , \ 1 \leq i\leq k ; \quad n = n^\dagger 
 \label{k state pp } \end{split}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the associated dual to this sdp is : @xmath122 , \\ 
 \textrm{subject to : } & \sum_{i=1}^{k}m_i=\mathbb{i } ; \quad m_i\geq0 , \   \forall i. \label{k state pp dual } \end{split}\end{aligned}\ ] ] by strong duality , the result of both optimizations eqs . 
 ( [ k state pp ] ) and ( [ k state pp dual ] ) will be the same . 
 notice the similarity in form to eqs . 
 ( [ k state bfm ] ) and ( [ k state pp ] ) on the one hand , and to eqs . 
 ( [ k state bfm dual ] ) and ( [ k state pp dual ] ) on the other . 
 caves _ et  al . _  show that if a set of states is bfm compatible , then it is also pp compatible @xcite . 
 this can readily be seen from the two measures of compatibility defined by eqs . 
 ( [ k state bfm ] ) and ( [ k state pp ] ) . 
 if the set @xmath115 is bfm compatible then @xmath123 and there exists a positive semidefinite @xmath124 satisfying the constraints of eq . 
 ( [ k state bfm ] ) such that @xmath125>0 $ ] . 
 being positive semidefinite implies that @xmath124 is hermitian , so by setting @xmath126 we obtain an @xmath127 satisfying the constraints of eq . 
 ( [ k state pp ] ) such that @xmath128>0 $ ] . 
 this implies that @xmath129 and the set is also pp compatible . 
 thus , we have the following result :    @xmath130 .      a third compatibility measure for quantum states , stronger than both bfm and pp compatibility , 
 is that of _ equal support _ ( es ) @xcite . 
 a set of states @xmath115 is es compatible if and only if the states have the same support . 
 again , we can define a measure of es compatibility @xmath131 by an sdp :    the es compatibility of a set @xmath115 , @xmath132 , can be defined as : @xmath133    it can be shown ( appendix [ es sdp appendix ] ) that the dual sdp is : @xmath134 , \\ 
 \textrm{subject to : } & \sum_{i=1}^{d}\alpha_i\geq1 ; \\ & \sum_{j=1}^{k}\rho_j \sum_{i=1}^{k } m_i \geq \begin{pmatrix } \alpha_1 & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & \alpha_d \end{pmatrix};\\ & \alpha_i\in\mathbb{r } , \alpha_i\geq0 ,   m_i\geq 0,\   \forall i. \label{k state es dual } \end{split}\end{aligned}\ ] ] again , the primal and dual sdps will give the same value , and will return 0 if the states in @xmath115 are es incompatible as they do not have equal support . 
 caves _ et  al . 
 _  show that if a set of states is es compatible , then it is also bfm compatible . 
 equivalently , if the states are bfm incompatible , then they are also es incompatible 
 . this can be rederived by comparing the sdps in eqs . 
 ( [ k state bfm dual ] ) and ( [ k state es dual ] ) . 
 if @xmath115 is bfm incompatible , then there exists a set @xmath135 that satisfies the constraints of eq . 
 ( [ k state bfm dual ] ) such that : @xmath136=0.\ ] ] by picking the set @xmath137 to be the eigenvalues of @xmath138 , @xmath139 will be a feasible solution to the sdp in eq . 
 ( [ k state es dual ] ) that returns @xmath140 . 
 therefore , @xmath115 is also es incompatible . 
 the fact that a feasible solution to the bfm dual sdp can be used as the basis for a feasible solution to the es dual gives :    @xmath141 . 
 the problem of state compatibility is rather subtle , because state assignments do not perfectly reflect the information used to create them . different measures of compatibility ( and different methods of pooling information ) may make sense for different ways that alice and bob may have acquired their information . 
 it is certainly impossible to define a measure of compatibility without some assumption about what type of information was used to produce the state assignments . by contrast , the qualitative criterion of @xcite only requires that the states _ might _ describe the same system . 
 looking at different methods of acquiring information , however , remains an interesting question . within a particular assumption about information gathering 
 , it may make sense to define measures of compatibility and methods of pooling states , and these might be useful in practice . 
 we defined one such measure  which is the solution of a semidefinite program  and one such pooling method , which have an interpretation based on the assumption that the observers state assignments derive from information acquired by measurements of a particular form . 
 there is still considerable room for development in this area . 
 moreover , as discussed in sec . 
 [ sdp_sec ] , there are other quite different approaches to the problem of state compatibility @xcite , based on the existence of measurements that discriminate between pairs of states ; these approaches lead to an entire hierarchy of compatibility conditions . 
 we have shown that for two of these criteria ( pp and es compatibility ) , we can define measures of compatibility based on sdps , just as for bfm compatibility 
 . it would be interesting to determine whether compatibility measures for the other definitions given in @xcite ( weak and weak@xmath142 ) also can be formulated as sdps . 
 the status of these other idea of compatibility leaves much to be explored , and may be the key to understanding compatibility and the ability ( or inability ) to achieve consensus between observers with different priors .

78,"transport coefficients such as shear viscosity represent fundamental properties of a system and contain direct information about the underlying physics . for 
 qcd matter in the temperature range probed by an ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision , such quantities are exceptionally difficult to calculate from first principles . on the other hand , observables in these experiments 
 can be quite sensitive to transport coefficients , potentially allowing for a measurement to be extracted from data  @xcite . 
 thus , such a precision extraction is a topic of significant interest . in the past 
 , a precision extraction has been hampered by significant theoretical uncertainty , especially that arising from poor knowledge of particle production and thermalization in the earliest stages . 
 a number of viscous hydrodynamic calculations have been performed , which have been quite successful at reproducing flow measurements  @xcite . 
 typically , a small value of viscosity is required in order to fit data  not too much more than a few times the conjectured lower bound @xmath2 . 
 however , the precise best - fit value depends on various aspects of the calculations that are not fully constrained , and this introduces uncertainty in any extraction from data . 
 although these uncertainties have been the target of significant investigation , it has so far been done in a piecemeal fashion  @xcite . 
 no one has yet attempted to compile this information in a systematic study of all sources of uncertainty in order to place a robust and reliable upper bound on @xmath0 . 
 in addition , the conjectured bound is now known not to be universal , so it is of great interest to determine if one can place a lower bound on the quantity . 
 currently , there is no convincing evidence that measured data can not be reproduced with ideal hydrodynamics , and in fact most flow data can be reproduced quite well in such calculations  @xcite . in these proceedings 
 we present a proposal for how to extract @xmath0 with the smallest uncertainty currently possible , as well as preliminary results on such an extraction including a quantitative error bar obtained by systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty . 
 , mc - kln  @xcite v3.43 and its glauber implementation [ glauber ( discs ) ] , mckt - v1.25 with negative binomial fluctuations  @xcite ( mcrcbk ( nb ) ) , dipsy  @xcite , and urqmd  @xcite . ]    in a standard picture of a heavy - ion collision , the asymmetric region of overlap in a collision between two nuclei results in a anisotropy in the transverse density of the system at early times . over time 
 , this spatial anisotropy is transformed into a momentum anisotropy by a collective response that is well described by ( viscous ) hydrodynamics . 
 in fact , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 is ( to a good approximation ) directly proportional to this initial eccentricity in a given collision event : @xmath4 . 
 the proportionality constant depends sensitively on the viscosity of the medium , however , poor knowledge of the earliest stages of the collision result in significant uncertainty in @xmath5 see , for example , the top left panel of fig . 
 [ ecc ] , which shows root - mean - square values of @xmath5 from a number of commonly - used models for initial conditions measurements are sensitive to the rms value of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath6 . 
 the resulting uncertainty in @xmath3 has been the largest source of uncertainty when determining @xmath0 from data  @xcite . 
 though there has been much recent study concerning the physics of the early stages of a collision  @xcite , it is not yet possible to make a reliable statement about what range of values of initial eccentricity are within the realm of possibility . 
 it is now known that quantum fluctuations are also a significant source of anisotropy in the initial state , and therefore anisotropic flow . 
 this is especially apparent from the presence of large odd harmonics , such as triangular flow @xmath7 , which is generated from a spatial `` triangularity '' , defined similarly to the eccentricity @xmath8 this would be zero at midrapidity in the absence of event - by - event fluctuations . 
 the triangularity that one sees in a calculation is largely determined by the strength of these fluctuations . 
 in contrast , the differences in particle production mechanisms that lead to very different @xmath5 in non - central collisions has very little effect on @xmath9 . 
 compare , for example , the triangularities of the mc - kln model versus glauber ( discs ) in fig . 
 [ ecc ] , which contain only fluctuations from random position of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , implemented in exactly the same way in the mc - kln code . 
 the triangularity @xmath9 is very similar , despite the fact that the two pictures of particle production result in a very different eccentricity @xmath5 .    by comparing the results from other models , 
 it is clear that there still remains some uncertainty due to different way fluctuations are implemented . despite the seemingly modest reduction in uncertainty ( as compared to the uncertainty in @xmath5 ) , one can reasonably argue that the results in the second panel of fig . 
 [ ecc ] represent the full range of results that can be expected , in marked contrast to the results in the first panel . 
 the models with the lowest triangularity are known to be missing important sources of fluctuations , while the large fluctuations in the models with the largest @xmath9 can not be reconciled with constraints from @xmath10 measurements  @xcite . 
 one might thus propose to extract @xmath0 from measurements of @xmath7 to minimize uncertainty from the initial conditions . 
 however , we can make use of more experimental constraints by noting that in the most central collisions , all harmonics are generated entirely from fluctuations , and the above discussion still applies . 
 one further convenient factor is that , for ultra - central collisions , the approximate proportionality @xmath11 holds for all @xmath12  @xcite . 
 this allows for a comprehensive parameter study with reasonable computing resources . 
 thus , our proposal is to extract @xmath0 from a simultaneous fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements from ultra - central collisions at the highest - energy heavy - ion collisions . 
 these data are least sensitive to uncertain aspects of theory , and therefore allow for the the most precise extraction of @xmath0 with the smallest possible uncertainty . 
 such data are available from the atlas collaboration for @xmath3@xmath14 in the 1% of most central collisions  @xcite .     for n = 26 at 01% centrality , as a function of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath0 . 
 right : fit values corresponding to the minimum chi - squared curves in the left plot . 
 the green bars represent measured values from the atlas collaboration  @xcite ; the vertical thickness represents the combined statistical and systematic error . 
 models with large fluctuations and a correspondingly large best - fit @xmath0 tend to have a steeper slope than models with smaller eccentricities . 
 the range of best - fit viscosity values for the curves in the left plot gives an indication of the uncertainty in an extraction of @xmath0 due to the uncertain initial anisotropy in the initial state ( @xmath15 0.05 ) .

 in a theoretical calculation , the viscosity of the medium can be taken to be a free parameter . with all other parameters fixed , 
 one can calculate @xmath13 as a function of @xmath0 , and perform a least - squares fit to find the preferred value . if a particular parameter is uncertain , one can vary that parameter within the allowed range and redo the fit . 
 the shift of best - fit @xmath0 indicates the size of the resulting error bar in @xmath0 due to this particular source of uncertainty . 
 if one then varies all possible aspects of the theory in all possible combinations , the smallest and the largest extracted values thus represent a robust , if conservative , upper and lower error bar for the quantity . 
 this is the idea behind the preliminary results shown at this conference . 
 details will be given in a forthcoming publication , but an example fit for a calculation using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters but different initial conditions is shown in fig . 
 it is notable that hydrodynamics can , in fact , simultaneously give a good description of all @xmath13 . 
 however , it is also interesting to note the tendency for tension in the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 for all initial conditions tested . 
 we reported a preliminary result of @xmath16 , but a few comments are in order . 
 first , the calculations used a constant value of @xmath0 during the hydrodynamic evolution . 
 therefore , the result is an average value that corresponds to the viscosity at the typical time when flow is built up . 
 the lower bound indicates that purely ideal hydrodynamic calculations can not describe these data . 
 this is a significant result . 
 however , it is technically possible that the viscosity could dip below our lower bound at some point during the evolution , so this result does _ not _ represent a lower bound for the viscosity of qcd over its entire temperature range . 
 second , since it has never before been done , we want to be confident at every stage that we have a robust and reliable error bar . 
 the preliminary result , therefore , is fairly conservative , and the error bar will likely be smaller in the final result after further study . 
 we argue that at the current time , the most precise value for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 of the quark - gluon plasma can be obtained by a fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements in ultra - central collisions . 
 we further report preliminary results such an extraction , including an error bar from a systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty .

79,"it is well known that a single linear ( non - branched ) polymer consisting of @xmath1 monomers in a diluted solution with a good solvent where it is in a swollen conformation with gyration ( flory ) radius @xmath2 , @xmath3 , undergoes a phase transition to a collapsed globule  with flory radius @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the dimensionality of space ) if the solvent quality deteriorates as it usually does when the temperature of the solution is lowered below the so - called @xmath6-point . 
 many theoretical tools have been successfully applied to linear polymers , and considerable progress has been made in understanding this collapse transition  @xcite . 
 in contrast , much less is known about collapse transition of randomly branched polymers , which are usually assumed being macroscopically either isotropic or directed . 
 as far as the isotropic case is concerned , a number of numerical studies has been performed over the last 20 years or so  @xcite . 
 the picture that arises from these studies is much more complex than that for the collapse of linear polymers . 
 the basic reason for this added complexity is the possibility for introducing more than one fugacity to drive the collapse . 
 it appears that the line of collapse transitions in the phase diagram consist of 2 qualitatively different parts . 
 one part of the line , called the line of @xmath6-transitions , corresponds to continuous transitions with universal critical exponents from swollen polymer configurations with tree - like character to compact coil - like configurations . 
 the other part of the transition line , the line of @xmath7-transitions , corresponds to the collapse of swollen foam- or sponge - like polymers with many cycles of bonds between the monomers to vesicle - like compact structures . 
 if this transition is assumed to be continuous , one finds nonuniversal exponents  @xcite . 
 the two different parts of the collapse - transition line are separated by a higher multicritical point which belongs to the isotropic percolation universality class . 
 one of the open questions regarding the phase diagram is the existence of a possible further transition line between the configurations of the collapsed polymers .    as far as directed branched polymers ( dbp ) and their collapse ( cdbp ) 
 is concerned , the theoretical picture  @xcite is somewhat clearer than in the isotropic case , in particular in @xmath8-dimensions ( one transversal and one longitudinal ; in the following , we will denote the full space dimension as @xmath9 ) . noting that branched polymers , lattice animals , and lattice trees belong to the same universality class 
 , one can use the results of dhar @xcite on collapsing directed strongly embedded or site animals . 
 this way , henkel and seno @xcite have shown that there is only one type of @xmath6-transitions which describes the collapse of directed branched polymers in @xmath10-dimensions . 
 this collapse transition belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . 
 furthermore , dhar has shown in ref . 
 @xcite that the collapse transition is also of directed percolation type in @xmath11 if a special relation between the potentials ( fugacities ) of directed site animals holds . 
 flory theory was applied by redner and coniglio @xcite . 
 they correctly derived the upper critical dimension @xmath12 , but they found critical exponents for the cdbp transition that are different from the dp exponents which , however , is incorrect as we shall see .    whereas a comprehensive field theory for swollen ( extended ) polymers 
 has been existing for quite some time , the field theory for the collapse of branched polymers is much less developed . 
 as far as we know , there exist to date no field theory for the directed case . for the isotropic case 
 , there is the seminal work by lubensky and isaacson @xcite and harris and lubensky @xcite . 
 however , it turns out that these papers , as far as they consider the collapse transition , contain a fundamental error in the renormalization procedure ( they overlook a required renormalization ) , and as a consequence the long - standing @xmath13-loop results for the collapse transition are not entirely correct  @xcite . in an upshot , one may say that there are important open questions and unresolved issues in the theory for the collapse of directed and isotropic branched polymers .    here and in a following publication  @xcite , we develop dynamical field theories for the collapse of directed and isotropic branched polymers , respectively . the idea behind these theories 
 is to start out with stochastic activation processes which lead to percolation clusters and then to exploit the well know connection between branched polymers and lattice animals , i.e. , cluster of a given mass . 
 we concentrate on large animals below the percolation point , and we equip the theory with enough parameters to allow for triciticality which corresponds to the collapse of large branched polymers . as alluded to above , the directed case has the benefit of being simpler than the isotropic case . 
 it allows us to learn about the fundamental structure of dynamical field theories for the collapse of branched polymers and thereby to sharpen our tools for the more complicated isotropic case . 
 the most important concrete result of the present paper is that we show to arbitrary order in renormalized perturbation theory with @xmath0-expansion that the cdbp transition is of dp - type . 
 the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows : in sec . 
 [ sec : towardsfieldtheory ] , we develop our field theoretic model . in sec .  [

 [ sec : polymerscaling ] , we translate our field theoretic results for the collapse transition into a form that is more commonly used in polymer theory , and we compare them to numerical simulations . in sec . 
 [ sec : concludingremarks ] , we give a few concluding remarks . 
 there are tow appendixes . in appendix 
 [ app:1loop ] , we present some details of our 1-loop calculation , and in appendix  [ app : essentialsingularities ] , we discuss essential singularities . 
 in this subsection , we develop a field theoretic stochastic functional @xcite for dbp based on very general arguments alluding to the universal properties of a corresponding markoffian stochastic percolation process . 
 we consider polymers as clusters in @xmath5 transversal and @xmath13 longitudinal ( time ) directions . below the percolation threshold 
 all of the clusters generated by such a process are finite . 
 the distribution function for the large clusters decays exponentially with their mass ( number of monomers ) . 
 it is well known @xcite that untypical very large clusters with linear sizes essentially larger than the correlation lengths are generated as rare events . 
 the statistical properties of these fractal clusters belong to the universality class of lattice animals . 
 thus , they also form the prototype model for single randomly branched polymers in a dilute solution . allowing for a further mechanism in the percolation process which favors contacts of the monomers , we introduce a possible tricritical instability that leads to the collapse of the large clusters describing the branched polymers .    a langevin equation 
 which describes directed percolation processes allowing for tricritical behavior has been well known for many years @xcite . 
 it is based on the fundamental phenomenological principles of absorbing processes in conjunction with a density and gradient expansion . 
 the basic variable or field is the density @xmath14 of agents ( infected individuals ) , which models the fractal monomer - density of the polymer generated from a given source @xmath15 . 
 this choice of field is possible because the stochastic process generates clusters such that the numbers of monomers , branching- , and end - points are all of the same order which is in contrast to the case of linear polymers . in other words , 
 the density is a proper field for the current problem because branched polymers are really `` fur - bearing animals '' . 
 the langevin equation in ito - interpretation is given by    [ stochproz ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a kinetic coefficient , and the noise correlation reads @xmath18\,\delta(\mathbf{x } -\mathbf{x}^{\prime})\,\delta(t - t^{\prime})\ , . 
 \label{langkorr}\ ] ]    we assume gaussian noise which we can for our purposes without loss of generality because higher order noise does not change the universal properties of the process . 
 the leading terms of the expansions are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . 
 further terms in the expansions are possible but they turn out being irrelevant . in mean - field theory , the percolation transition occurs at @xmath23 . 
 as announced above , we restrict ourself in the following to the region @xmath24 in which only non - percolating directed branched clusters with a typical linear size @xmath25 are generated from a time- and space - localized source . however , our primary interest is in the rare events where the fractal clusters of linear size essentially larger than @xmath26 are generated . as long as @xmath27 , 
 the second order term @xmath28 of the rate @xmath29 is irrelevant . 
 we permit both signs of @xmath30 so that our model accounts for a tricritical instability . 
 consequently , we need the second order term with @xmath31 for stabilization purposes , i.e. , to limit the density @xmath32 to finite values . the parameters @xmath33 ( which are irrelevant for the original percolation problem ) are assumed to be positive to smooth density fluctuations . 
 an essential property of percolation processes is the linear dependence of the noise correlation ( [ langkorr ] ) on the density if @xmath34 for @xmath35 . 
 this property guarantees that the percolation process is really absorbing @xcite , and guarantees the description by a density variable . 
 last but not least , all the terms lead to @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 on grounds of the absorbing state . 
 the approach that we are taking focuses on general principles for processes belonging to the same universality class and is therefore necessarily phenomenological  @xcite . 
 we devise our field theoretic model representing the universality class using a purely mesoscopic stochastic formulation based on the correct order parameters identified through physical insight in the nature of the critical phenomenon . 
 hence , the stochastic response functional that we are about to derive stays in full analogy to the landau - ginzburg - wilson functional and provides a reliable starting point of the field theoretic method . 
 alternatively , one might use the so - called exact  approach which , as a central step , consists of reformulating a microscopic master - equation for chemical reactions as a bosonic field theory on a lattice . for a recent excellent review article on this method see @xcite . 
 we choose not to use this method as our main approach because we feel that it treats universal properties not as transparently as the purely mesoscopic formulation does . 
 nonetheless , we think that the lattice reactions which would be the starting point for the exact  approach to the current problem have some pedagogical value as they can help to nurture ones intuition about the epidemic process . here , these reactions comprise the well known reactions leading to dp :    [ reakt ] @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a lattice point , @xmath41 denotes a vector to a neighboring point , and @xmath42 stands for an agent ( particle ) at @xmath40 . 
 moreover , because we are interested in tricriticality , we need additional reactions that produce more compact clusters : @xmath43    for illustrations of the reactions defined in eq . 
 ( [ reakt ] ) , see fig . 
 [ fig : reactions ] and refs .  @xcite . 
 note that the single site back - reactions , eqs . 
 ( [ back1 ] ) and ( [ back2 ] ) act against multiple occupations of lattice sites and are thus reminiscent of an excluded - volume interaction . as mentioned above 
 , we will not use the exact  approach in this paper . 
 however , for the adherents of the exact  approach , we mention without presenting further details that we have verified that he bosonic representation of the reaction equations ( [ reakt ] ) leads to the same stochastic functional ( called an action in that approach ) as the purely mesoscopic approach .        returning to the latter approach , we now recast the langevin equations  ( [ stochproz ] ) as a stochastic response functional @xcite @xmath44 here , we have neglected further higher order terms that will not result in any relevant contributions to our final response functional . 
 @xmath45 describes the statistics of dp clusters generated by the stochastic process ( [ stochproz ] ) . 
 having this functional , one can calculate the average of any observable that is polynomial in @xmath32 and @xmath46 , say @xmath47 $ ] , by functional integration with weight @xmath48 , @xmath49 \ 
 , \mathcal{o}[n,\tilde{n } ] \exp(-\mathcal{j}_{\rm{dp}})\nonumber\\ & = : \operatorname{tr}\big(\mathcal{o}[n,\tilde{n } ] \exp(-\mathcal{j}_{\rm{dp}})\big)\ , . 
 \label{unrestrav}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here and in the following , path integrations are always interpreted in the sense of the ( mathematical save ) ito - discretization . 
 one has to be careful to set the range of the variables of the functional integration correctly as there are some subtleties involved . 
 some authors @xcite use functional integrals of the type featured in eq . 
 ( [ unrestrav ] ) purely in a restricted sense as a device for generating a perturbation expansion . 
 this precautionary view arises from a narrow interpretation of the bosonic functional integral after elimination of irrelevant terms including higher order monomials of the fields which are in general required to ensure the convergence when fields become large . 
 however these convergence problems can and should be avoided by choosing the support for the functional integration properly , as was shown e.g.  by ciafaloni and onofri @xcite in the case of reggeon field theory ( rft which is equivalent to dp ) . 
 this type of consideration leads here to the rule that @xmath32 is to be integrated along the positive real axis whereas the integration of @xmath46 is performed along the full imaginary axis . 
 of course , deviations in finite regions , as e.g.  suggested by saddle - points , are possible . 
 one of the most important observables in the current problem is the mass or total number of monomers of a cluster , @xmath50 where we have included the kinetic coefficient @xmath17 into the definition for later convenience ( if we were not including @xmath17 in the definition of @xmath51 , we had to multiply @xmath51 in subsequent formulas by @xmath17 on dimensional grounds ) . 
 because we are mainly interested in the scaling behavior of a single large polymer with @xmath52 monomers , we will focus in the following on averages that are restricted to clusters of a given mass @xmath1 , and we assume without loss of generality that this cluster emanates from a weak source @xmath53 of agents at the origin @xmath54 at time @xmath55 . for our general observable @xmath56 $ ] , this leads to @xmath57\exp\bigl ( q\tilde{n}(\mathbf{0},0)\bigr)\rangle_{\rm{dp } } \nonumber \\ & \simeq q\langle\delta \bigl(n-\mathcal{m}\bigr)\mathcal{o}[n ] \tilde{n}(\mathbf{0},0))\rangle_{\rm{dp } }   \,,\label{restrav}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the probability distribution for finding a cluster of given mass @xmath1 with the last equation holding only asymptotically for large @xmath1 and small @xmath59 . note that the zeroth - order term in the taylor expansion leading to the second line of eq . 
 ( [ restrav ] ) vanishes because @xmath60\rangle_{\rm{dp } } =   \mathcal{f } [ 0]$ ] for any functional @xmath61 of @xmath32 because dp is an absorbing process . 
 note also , that the formalism allows with ease to ask for the probability of clusters generated by several sources at different points @xmath62 by inserting more fields @xmath63 in the exponential of the average ( [ restrav ] ) . 
 equation  ( [ restrav ] ) implies that the probability distribution for finding a cluster of mass @xmath1 is given by  @xcite @xmath64 note that @xmath58 is correctly normalized , @xmath65 , because @xmath66\rangle_{\rm{dp } } =   \mathcal{f } [ 0]$ ] for any functional @xmath61 of @xmath46 due to causality . 
 @xmath58 is asymptotically proportional ( up to nonuniversal amplitudes and an exponential factor @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an effective coordination number of the lattice ) to the lattice animal number @xmath69 which plays an important role in percolation theory . 
 @xmath69 measures the number of directed clusters of size @xmath1 , weighted by fugacities for different cluster properties as contacts , loops , and so on . in terms of the number of configurations 
 @xmath70 consisting of @xmath1 sites , @xmath71 bonds and @xmath72 not bounded contacts , @xmath69 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath73 the fugacities @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to the parameters of the stochastic functional @xmath76 . 
 the collapse transition occurs for large @xmath1 when @xmath75 becomes critical because the latter rewards contact - rich animals . 
 if we assume universality , the probability distribution @xmath58 and the cluster number should be related for @xmath52 via @xmath77 and conversely @xmath78 a relation that we shall use later on . 
 now we turn to the signature of the collapse transition . 
 chemically , in a diluted solution the transition occurs when the hard core repulsion of the monomers is exactly compensated by their weak effective attraction , i.e. , when the second virial coefficient @xmath79 in the expansion of the osmotic pressure in powers of the polymer density vanishes  @xcite . 
 up to a minus sign this second virial - coefficient is proportional to the space integral of the correlation function between two polymers in the solution . 
 hence , in our formalism , the signature of the collapse - transition is the vanishing of the space - time integral of the two - polymer correlation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is asymptotically the probability distribution of two large clusters of total large mass @xmath1 generated by two roots at @xmath82 and @xmath83 . 
 if the distance of the point @xmath83 from the origin is substantial bigger than their linear sizes , the two clusters decouple , and we have @xmath84 i.e. , @xmath85 becomes a cumulant . 
 the second virial - coefficient is proportional to the total measure of this correlation times the factor @xmath86 , which comes into play if one considers only clusters of the same mass @xmath1 , @xmath87    instead of working with quantities discussed above as functions of @xmath1 , it is often more convenient to work with their laplace - transformed counterparts . 
 for @xmath58 we then have the representation by an inverse laplace transformation @xmath88 with @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes averages taken with respect to the new stochastic functional @xmath91 note that the normalization condition for @xmath58 results in @xmath92 . 
 the function @xmath93 corresponds to the generating function of the animal numbers @xmath94 , and plays in the following the role of an order parameter . before moving on to mean - field theory 
 , we would like to mention that a shifted version of the laplace variable @xmath95 will play later on a role akin to that of an external field .      in this subsection , we discuss various aspects of dbp in mean - field theory . 
 our motivation for presenting this mean - field theory is twofold . 
 ( i ) the field theory that we are going to present in the following sections is fairly involved . 
 mean - field theory , on the other hand , allows us to obtain results with relative ease and may serve the reader as a warm up for the more difficult sections to come . 
 ( ii ) at mean - field level , various results for dbp are well known . by reproducing these results 
 , we will find that our model satisfies important consistency checks . 
 interested in a mean - field approximation in the spirit of landau theory as the starting point of the systematic perturbation expansion , we look for stationary and homogeneous saddle - points of @xmath96 , which are determined by    @xmath97    these equations are solved by    @xmath98    [ spl ]    the correct sign of the square root is determined from the normalization condition @xmath92 . 
 the equation of state for @xmath93 shows a branch - point on the negative real axis at @xmath99 where @xmath100 becomes critical . 
 note that the presence of @xmath101 in eq . 
 ( [ sp2 ] ) leads effectively to the replacement of the under - critical parameter @xmath102 by the critical parameter @xmath103 . 
 hence , this equation leads to the usual mean - field equation of tricritical dp @xcite . 
 it follows that the saddle - point solution , eqs . 
 ( [ spl ] ) is stable as long as @xmath104 . if @xmath105 becomes negative , eq .  ( [ sp2 ] ) developes continuously a non - zero positive solution @xmath106 at the critical value @xmath100 , signalling the collapse to a compact cluster as a continuous phase transition . 
 qualitatively , it is the branch - point singularity that determines the form of @xmath58 , and higher orders in perturbation theory , though leading to quantitative improvement , do not result in qualitative changes of that from . to get the asymptotic expansion of @xmath58 , we deform the contour of the complex integral in eq . 
 ( [ inv - lapl ] ) as illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : complexint ] . if @xmath107 denotes the discontinuity of the function @xmath108 at the branch cut , 
 we get @xmath109 the non - universal factor @xmath110 is common to all the quantities described by eq . 
 ( [ restrav ] ) and cancels therefore in all averages @xmath111 . 
 note that for large @xmath1 only the small neighborhood of @xmath112 matters . 
 in mean - field theory , it is easy to calculate @xmath58 without further approximation . 
 we obtain @xmath113\nonumber\\ & \simeq qn^{-3/2}\exp[-nr^{2}/2 g ] \ , .\end{aligned}\ ] ] this distribution has its maximum near the characteristic value @xmath114 . as stated above , we are , however , mainly interested in the rare events with @xmath115 where the asymptotic forms are valid . 
 note that the second line which gives the large-@xmath1 behavior is in perfect agreement with the well known asymptotic result @xmath116 with the so - called entropic exponent given in mean - field approximation by @xmath117 and a non - universal number @xmath118 .     on the negative real axis.,width=188 ] 
 gaussian fluctuations are governed by the second variations of the stochastic functional @xmath119 . 
 after fourier transformation in space and time , we have    @xmath120}{\delta\tilde{n}\delta n}\right\vert _ { sp}=i\omega+\lambda(\tau+\mathbf{q}^{2})\ , , \label{gamma11}\\ \gamma_{0,2}(\mathbf{q},\omega)_{\rm{mf } }   &   = \left . 
 \frac{\delta\mathcal{j}_{z } [ \tilde{n},n]}{\delta n\delta n } \right\vert_{sp } = \lambda \bigl(g^\prime+c\mathbf{q}^{2}\bigr)\phi\,,\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath121 . 
 @xmath122 is zero . 
 the propagator follows from the inverse of @xmath123 in @xmath124-representation as @xmath125\ , , \label{propag}\ ] ] and the @xmath46-correlation function integrated over space and time is @xmath126 the second virial coefficient follows from eq . 
 ( [ vir2 ] ) to leading order as @xmath127 it vanishes at the mean - field collapse transition , that is for @xmath128 . 
 next , we calculate the average monomer density @xmath129 emanating from a source at @xmath130 . for this calculation , 
 we recall eq . 
 ( [ restrav ] ) . when specialized to @xmath131 = n ( { \bm{{\rm x } } } , t)$ ] , the second line of eq . 
 ( [ restrav ] ) is equal to the laplace transform of @xmath132 the latter being the ( space - wise ) fourier transform of @xmath133 , eq . 
 ( [ propag ] ) . 
 collecting , we find that @xmath134 can be written as @xmath135 where the integration path is taken appropriately as outlined above for the probability distribution . the momentum integration back to the @xmath83 representation is straightforward , and we obtain @xmath136 .\end{aligned}\ ] ] form this result 
 , we can read off directly that the longitudinal and transversal radii of gyration scale as @xmath137 and @xmath138 with the well known mean - field animal exponents @xmath139      the response functional @xmath140 , eq . 
 ( [ jz ] ) , is form - invariant under three continuous transformations . 
 thus , three parameters of the functional are redundant . here 
 , we exploit the symmetries to eliminate two redundant parameters and to define scale - invariant effective couplings . 
 the symmetry transformations are : ( i ) a rescaling of the fields    [ form - inv ] @xmath141 ( ii ) a mixing of the fields @xmath142 and ( iii ) a shift of the response field @xmath143    we eliminate the redundant parameters @xmath102 and @xmath72 by specializing the latter two , which do not transform the density field @xmath32 , by @xmath144 this special shift reminds of the saddle - point , eq . 
 ( [ phimf ] ) , and eliminates the uncritical parameter @xmath102 in favor of @xmath103 . after this shift the fields and their expectation values are small quantities for small @xmath103 , and a perturbation expansion is appropriate . the parameter @xmath103 is a free parameter at this place , and , of course , we can set this parameter to zero . however , it is more economical to use it in the renormalization program as a small control parameter because it attains at least an additive renormalization . 
 the shift alone introduces besides the bilinear gradient term @xmath145 a further quadratic gradient term @xmath146 that is thereafter eliminated by the special mixing in eq . 
 ( [ red - entf ] ) . 
 this term also attains renormalizations , and to cure uv - divergencies a counter term @xmath146 must be reintroduced via the renormalization scheme , which we will do as we proceed . 
 the transformation ( [ red - entf ] ) suggests the definitions of new coupling constants @xmath147 and new control parameters @xmath148 note that the three control parameters @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 go to zero in the mean - field theory of the collapse of large branched polymers , i.e. , near @xmath152 , and that , however , the coupling constant @xmath153 stays finite . 
 the elimination of all terms that are at least irrelevant ( in the sense of a naive scaling consideration ) in comparison to the retained ones reduces the stochastic functional to @xmath154n+\frac{\hat\tau_1}{2}n^2\nonumber\\ & \qquad+\big[-\frac{g_0}{2}\tilde{n}^{2}n+\frac{g_1}{2}\tilde{n}n^{2 } + \frac{g_2}{6}n^{3}\big ] + \hat{h}n\big\}\ , . 
 \label{jz - neu}\end{aligned}\ ] ] at this place we remark that for @xmath155 the stochastic functional @xmath156 has the same form as the stochastic functional for ordinary directed percolation with a quadratic rapidity - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath157 . 
 thus , in this special case the collapse transition belongs to the dp - universality class . 
 hence , we want to show wether @xmath158 is a relevant perturbation or it goes to zero under renormalization . 
 the modifications of the dynamical functional including the elimination of the irrelevant higher order couplings make it worthwhile to discuss the support of the functional integration over the fields @xmath46 and @xmath32 anew . 
 like before , the integration of @xmath32 , the density of monomers , goes along the positive real axes . 
 we write the third order terms of the integrand of @xmath119 as @xmath159 \nonumber\\ & = \frac{n}{2}\big[-g_{0}\big(\tilde{n } -\frac{g_{1}}{2g_{0}}n\big)^{2 } + \big(\frac{g_{2}}{3}+\frac{g_{1}^{2}}{4g_{0}}\big)n^{2}\big]\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] this form shows that the support of integration of @xmath46 must be so that @xmath160 is imaginary if this variable becomes large . 
 the convergence of the functional integral then requires @xmath161 to make sense beyond perturbation theory . 
 if these conditions are violated , higher order contributions become relevant for stability reasons , and a first - order transition takes place . 
 next , we consider the quadratic terms of @xmath162 . writing these terms as @xmath163n&+\frac{\hat\tau_1}{2}n^2 = \big(\tilde{n } 
 -\frac{g_{1}}{2g_{0}}n\big)\big[\hat\tau_0-\nabla^{2}\big]n\nonumber\\ & + \frac{1}{2}n\big[\big(\hat\tau_1+\frac{g_{1}}{g_{0}}\hat\tau_0\big)-\frac{g_{1}}{g_{0}}\nabla^{2}\big]n\end{aligned}\ ] ] we see that we have to require @xmath164 for stability of the saddle - point at @xmath165 ( for @xmath166 ) . 
 if these conditions are violated , a phase transition takes place .    through the @xmath167-function condition in eq . 
 ( [ prob_n ] ) which selects from all the generated clusters only the clusters with given mass @xmath1 , the stochastic functional @xmath168 has lost its typical causal structure , whereas the absorbing state condition still holds , @xmath169=0 $ ] . to restore the causal structure , we perform the duality transformation @xmath170 these steps lead us from eq . 
 ( [ jz - neu ] ) to @xmath171\varphi -\frac{\hat\tau_1}{2}\tilde{\varphi}^2\nonumber\\ & \qquad + i\big[\frac{g_0}{2}\tilde{\varphi}\varphi^{2}+\frac{g_1}{2}\tilde{\varphi}^{2}\varphi -\frac{g_2}{6}\tilde{\varphi}^{3}\big]+i\hat{h}\tilde{\varphi}\big\}\ , . 
 \label{j_ende}\end{aligned}\ ] ] evidently , this new functional obeys causality , @xmath172=0 $ ] , but the absorbing state property is satisfied only if @xmath173 . 
 if only @xmath155 holds , it defines rft with added linear and quadratic symmetry breaking terms . in the following , two facts will play an important role : ( i ) rft is equivalent to ordinary dp , and ( ii ) the added symmetry breaking terms do not alter the fixed point structure of rft .    as it stands , the @xmath174 is a truly proper field theoretic stochastic functional in the sense of being a minimal model . 
 nevertheless , it still contains that much generality that allows to study the statistics of swollen dbp and the cdbp transition 
 . these will be the subjects of the following sections . 
 in the previous section we have learned _ inter alia _ that the shape of @xmath175 for large @xmath1 is controlled by the immediate vicinity of the branch point @xmath152 and that correlation lengths are large when the parameter @xmath103 defined in eq . 
 ( [ spl ] ) is small . for studying large clusters based on our functional @xmath174 , eq . 
 ( [ j_ende ] ) , this means that we should focus on the limit of vanishing control parameters @xmath151 and @xmath149 . 
 the collapse transition of these large polymers occurs for vanishing @xmath150 . 
 this transition will be treated in the later sections . 
 here we are interested in the swollen phase of these polymers , and hence we consider a @xmath150 that is positive and finite , say of the order of @xmath13 . 
 then , @xmath150 can be eliminated through a simple redefinition of the fields @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , or formally by setting @xmath181 . 
 now , we count engineering dimensions . as usual , we employ the some inverse length scale @xmath182 which is convenient for this task . recalling that @xmath5 denotes the number of transversal dimensions 
 only , we have    @xmath183    we see that the upper critical dimension @xmath184 is @xmath185 and that @xmath186 is the only relevant coupling constant below @xmath187 . neglecting the irrelevant couplings , we obtain the response functional @xmath188 -\lambda\tilde{\varphi}^{2}\big\}\,,\label{j_yl}\end{aligned}\ ] ] that is known to describe the relaxational dynamics at the yang - lee singularity edge @xcite . here

 now , we return to the cdbp transition as the main topic of our paper . 
 our response functional @xmath174 , eq . 
 ( [ j_ende ] ) , describes specifically the cdbp transition when both control parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 become critical . in this case , they scale in terms of the inverse length scale @xmath182 as @xmath225 . 
 then the engineering dimensions of the fields and the remaining parameters follow as @xmath226 now , the upper critical dimension is @xmath12 . 
 all three coupling constants are relevant below @xmath184 . 
 there are no further contributions that are relevant under the condition of causality ( originating from the absorbing condition of the process ) which we have restored through the duality transformation  ( [ dualitytrafo ] ) . 
 it is well known that a perturbation expansion of correlation and response functions ( generally called greens functions ) based on a field theoretic model like @xmath174 produces uv - singularities which have to be regularized and renormalized by singular counter terms . here , we use minimal renormalization , i.e. , dimensional regularization followed by minimal subtraction of @xmath0-poles , to cure the theory from uv - divergencies . for 
 the general principles and methods of renormalization theory see , e.g. , ref .

 we use a ring @xmath227 to mark bare ( unrenormalized ) quantities , i.e. , we let @xmath228 , and so on . from here 
 on , quantities without a ring are understood as renormalized quantities . 
 to get rid of @xmath0-poles , we use the renormalization scheme    [ ren ] @xmath229    where @xmath230 and @xmath231 . here , we have introduced the two - dimensional vector @xmath232 . 
 note that the mixing - term proportional to @xmath233 reintroduces the aforementioned gradient term , see the discussion below eq . 
 ( [ red - entf ] ) . in minimal renormalization with dimensional expansion the additive contributions @xmath234 , @xmath235 
 , @xmath236 become formally zero , and the @xmath0-content of the other counterterms are defined by pure laurent - series :    @xmath237    where the counterterms @xmath238 , when determined at the loop - order @xmath239 , are homogeneous polynomials of the renormalized dimensionless coupling constants @xmath240 of order @xmath241 : @xmath242 . 
 corresponding expansions are valid for the various other counterterms @xmath233 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 which themselves are homogeneous polynomials of order @xmath241 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , respectively , at each loop - order @xmath239 . 
 we calculate the various renormalization factors @xmath247 and additional counter - terms using a two - tiered approach , viz . 
 we carry out an explicit 1-loop calculation and we employ ward identities . 
 the latter will be discussed further below . 
 our 1-loop calculation , see the appendix for details , produces    [ ren-1l ] @xmath248    where ellipsis symbolize terms of higher loop - order which are regular expansions in the coupling constants @xmath240 but , of course singular in @xmath0 . 
 note that in the case @xmath249 , where rapidity inversion symmetry holds , @xmath233 and @xmath250 are zero to all orders . in this case 
 we have also @xmath251 . in the general case all renormalizations are trivial if @xmath252 because then only diagrams without loops are generated by the perturbation expansion .      next , we derive a renormalization group ( rg ) in the usual way by utilizing that the bare theory is independent of the external , arbitrary inverse length scale @xmath182 which enters through the renormalization scheme . because of this independence , the derivative @xmath253 ( @xmath254 denotes derivatives holding bare parameters fixed ) vanishes for each unrenormalized quantity @xmath255 . switching from bare to renormalized quantities 
 @xmath256 depending only on renormalized parameters , the derivative @xmath257 changes to the rg differential operator @xmath258   \partial_{\hat{h}}\ , , \label{rge - diff}\end{aligned}\ ] ] which defines the infinitesimal generator of the rg , the ( half- ) group of scale changes of the length @xmath259 . 
 the application of @xmath260 to renormalized fields in averages produces @xmath261 recalling the renormalization scheme  ( [ ren ] ) and the form of the renormalization factors @xmath247 and the additional counter - terms discussed below it , we find    [ rgefunctions ] @xmath262    where @xmath263 , as well as    @xmath264    for the rg functions . 
 explicit 1-loop results for these rg functions follow readily from eqs . 
 ( [ ren-1l ] ) . 
 it has been noted since the early days of field theory that each symmetry transformation ( form - invariance ) which transforms not only fields but also parameters of a field theoretic functional implies the redundancy of one of its parameters and vice versa  @xcite . 
 redundancy means that a respective parameter is related to other parameters of the functional through simple linear transformations of the fields . 
 these transformations , however , must not change the physical contents of the functional . hence , in a proper field theory , redundant parameters can be and must be eliminated through linear transformations of the fields .    as we have already noted , the response functional @xmath174 , eq . 
 ( [ j_ende ] ) , is form - invariant under the three continuous transformations ( [ form - inv ] ) . 
 the mixing and shift transformations , eq . 
 ( [ red - entf ] ) , were used to eliminate two of the corresponding redundant parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath72 , and they introduced @xmath265 as a small free parameter . 
 now , we use this freedom to derive ward identities from the shift transformation , eq . 
 ( [ shift ] ) , which reads @xmath266 when expressed in terms of the fields @xmath267 and @xmath268 . 
 the response functional @xmath174 , eq . 
 ( [ j_ende ] ) , is invariant under this shift , @xmath269 = \mathcal{j}[{\tilde{\varphi}}^{\prime},\varphi^{\prime};\underline{\hat\tau}^{\prime},g_{\alpha } , h^{\prime}]\ , , \label{shift - inv - fu}\ ] ] if we also change the control parameters as follows :    [ shift - param ] @xmath270    here , we have introduced the two - dimensional vector @xmath271 . 
 primarily , the shift is defined for unrenormalized quantities . however , because it does not involve a transformation of the coupling constants , and the renormalization constants are only functions of the couplings , the shift - invariance , eq . 
 ( [ shift - inv - fu ] ) , also holds for the renormalized quantities with @xmath272 . 
 now , we compare the bare transformations with their renormalized counterpart . 
 we renormalize the bare form of eq . 
 ( [ shift - tau ] ) , @xmath273 with @xmath274 : @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 . 
 splitting this equation in singular and non - singular parts , we get    @xmath278    with @xmath279 . 
 the last equation , the first ward - identity , is easily checked at @xmath13-loop order by using eqs  ( [ ren-1l ] ) . 
 we perform the same procedure with eq . 
 ( [ shift - h ] ) and obtain    @xmath280    with @xmath281 . 
 also the second ward - identity , eq . 
 ( [ ward-2 ] ) , is easily checked at @xmath13-loop order by using eqs  ( [ ren-1l ] ) . 
 the ward identities ( [ ward-1 ] ) and ( [ ward-2 ] ) imply that there are further relations between the rg functions , viz.@xmath282 where @xmath283 . 
 these relations can be used _ 
 inter alia _ to check the consistency of the 1-loop results for the various rg functions and the results  ( [ ren-1l ] ) leading to them . 
 our results fulfill this consistency check . 
 more generally we derive relations between different vertex functions . 
 note that the vertex function @xmath284 is diagrammatically defined as the sum of all one - line irreducible diagrams with @xmath285 amputated external @xmath268- and @xmath286 amputated external @xmath287-lines @xcite . 
 let @xmath288 $ ] be the generating functional of the vertex functions , which we call the dynamic free - energy functional . 
 it has the same invariance property , eq . 
 ( [ shift - inv - fu ] ) , as the stochastic functional @xmath174 , which is identical to the mf - approximation of @xmath289 . 
 hence , we have @xmath290 = \gamma[{\tilde{\varphi}},\varphi;\underline{\hat\tau},g_{\alpha},0]+\lambda \hat{h}\int d^{d}xdt\tilde\varphi({\bf{x}},t)\nonumber\\ & = \gamma[{\tilde{\varphi}},\varphi+i\gamma;\underline{\hat\tau}+\gamma \underline{\bar{g}},g_{\alpha } , \hat{h}-\gamma\hat\tau_0-\gamma^2g_0/2]\ , , \label{shift - gamma - fu}\end{aligned}\ ] ] setting @xmath291 after differentiation leads to @xmath292 which is sometimes called equation of motion . 
 this general property of the dynamic free - energy energy functional holds equally well in renormalized and unrenormalized form , and is very helpful for higher - loop calculations . 
 especially , we find by taking repeated functional derivatives    [ ward - gamma - spec ] @xmath293    where the argument @xmath294 means that the wavevectors and frequencies of the vertex functions are set to zero .    up to this point we have not used the scaling transformation , eq . 
 ( [ resk ] ) , for eliminating a further redundancy . applying this rescaling of the fields 
 , @xmath174 remains invariant if we change its parameters to @xmath295 this invariance holds likewise for the renormalized and unrenormalized theory . 
 hence , it would be absolutely wrong to search at this place for fixed points , i.e. , zeros of of all three gell - mann  low functions , @xmath296 , because the free scale transformation poisons the renormalization flow . 
 before we can search for fixed points , we first must eliminate the scaling redundancy through the definition of scale invariant quantities . 
 we do that by defining the invariant dimensionless coupling constants    [ inv - quant ] @xmath297 and changing the fields and control parameters to their scaling invariant counterparts @xmath298    the rg differential operator @xmath260 applied only to scaling invariant quantities reduces to @xmath299   \partial_{h}\ , , \label{inv - rge - diff}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and its application to the invariant fields in averages produces @xmath300 here , we have defined the invariant rg functions @xmath301 where @xmath302 the invariant matrices @xmath303 and @xmath304 follow from their respective counterparts @xmath305 and @xmath306 as    @xmath307    from the above , we can straightforwardly collect the following explicit 1-loop for the invariant rg functions :    [ inv - wils - eps ] @xmath308    and    @xmath309    in the dp case , @xmath310 , the rge has to have the usual form known from dp @xcite . 
 it follows that @xmath311 and @xmath312 have to be zero to all loop orders for @xmath313 . for the invariant gell - mann  low functions we find    [ inv - beta - fu ] @xmath314    once again , the ward identities lead to relations between the rg functions , namely @xmath315 and @xmath316 where we have introduced the two orthogonal vectors @xmath317 and @xmath318 . 
 we define    [ kappa - ev ] @xmath319    hence , if @xmath320 , especially at a fixed point , it follows from eq . 
 ( [ inv - ward-2 ] ) that @xmath321 and @xmath322 are a left and a right eigenvector of @xmath323 , respectively , since the two vectors are orthogonal . in this case 
 , we find the two eigenvalues @xmath324 and @xmath325 . 
 of course , our 1-loop results for the invariant rg functions satisfy these relations holding to all loop - orders .    to determine the critical behavior , we need to extract those quantities that are invariant under all the symmetry transformations of the theory . applying the shift transformation the dynamic free energy functional  ( [ shift - gamma - fu ] ) , that such a set of quantities is given by @xmath326 and the combinations    [ vollinv ] @xmath327    where @xmath328 . 
 note that @xmath329 is linearly related to the laplace - variable @xmath95 .    in the following we are mainly interested in the average @xmath330 since this quantity is linearly related to @xmath331 . 
 we recall that the critical part of @xmath108 yields the asymptotic behavior of the probability @xmath58 by an inverse laplace transformation . 
 applying eq . 
 ( [ inv - rg - feld ] ) together with @xmath332 , and using the relations ( [ inv - ward-1 ] ) to ( [ kappa - ev ] ) between the rg - functions , we obtain the rges    [ flow ] @xmath333      next , we search for the stable fixed points of the invariant rge  ( [ inv - rg - feld ] ) with the rg generator eq . 
 ( [ inv - rge - diff ] ) . 
 the fixed point equations @xmath334 possess the following solutions : ( i ) the trivial fixed point @xmath335 which is unstable below four transversal dimensions , ( ii ) a fully stable fixed point @xmath336 with stability ( wegner-)exponents @xmath337 and @xmath338 ( which correspond to the _ two _ leading correction - to - scaling exponents ) , and ( iii ) a fixed point with one stable and one unstable direction @xmath339 which lies on a separatrix between the region of attraction of the fully stable fixed point and a region where the renormalization flow tends to infinity , signalling possibly a discontinuous collapse transition . 
 however , this fixed point lies in the unstable region , and is thus not accessible by our model . 
 we conclude , therefore , that the renormalization group flow reaches asymptotically the fully stable fixed point . the line @xmath313 in the two - dimensional space of the invariant coupling constants has to be a fixed line of the renormalization flow because this line corresponds to the rft - model , eq . 
 ( [ j_ende ] ) with @xmath155 , with its rapidity reversal invariance . 
 thus , @xmath340 holds to all loop - orders . 
 we conclude that as long as the collapse transition is continuous , it belongs to the universality class of directed percolation in all dimensions . 
 we would like to underscore that this result , which is the main result of our paper , holds to arbitrary order in perturbation theory . 
 the pivotal point is that for @xmath341 , which is the case at the stable fixed point , @xmath174 reduces to rft and thus , the universal behavior governed by this fixed point is that of the dp universality class . 
 the explicit 1-loop calculation was necessary to show the stability of this fixed point . 
 higher orders in perturbation theory modify the two stability exponents quantitatively , and thus affect corrections to scaling 
 . however , they do not change the stability of the fixed point qualitatively since in @xmath0-expansion , @xmath0 is virtually an infinitesimal quantity . 
 this does not answer , as always for the @xmath0-expansion , the question about a possible dimension @xmath342 at which the stability breaks down . 
 we conclude this subsection by collecting the critical exponents of the cdbp transition . 
 the anomalous scaling dimensions of the invariant fields are defined by @xmath343 at the stable fixed point they coincide because @xmath344 . 
 also @xmath345 for @xmath346 . 
 thus , the coinciding exponents are the same as for dp , @xmath347 . 
 the two eigenvalues @xmath348 and @xmath349 define the order parameter and the correlation length exponents of dp , respectively ,    [ krit - ex ] @xmath350 @xmath351 defines the dynamical exponent @xmath352 as is customary , we furthermore introduce the exponent @xmath353    which is related to the scaling behavior of @xmath329 .       as independent variables . 
 the regions i and iii are the physical parameter regions for a dp - process . 
 the region iii is excluded for the parameters of the statistics of directed branched polymers . 
 the axes marked red . 
 correspond to some redundant variable such as @xmath354 , @xmath355 , or @xmath72 . 
 the solid dot marks the dp - transition point corresponding to the collapse of large dbp . 
 the line labeled @xmath356 with @xmath357 , where the order parameter @xmath93 shows a branching point singularity , correspond to large swollen dbp . 
 the shading indicates region iv , where the order parameter @xmath93 becomes a complex function . at the straight line @xmath358 with @xmath359 between regions 
 iii and iv , the order - parameter shows essential singularities . 
 the lines become surfaces if a redundant variable is admitted.,width=188 ]    next , we determine the equation of state . to this end , we introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath360 , @xmath361 , and @xmath362 , and seek @xmath363 as a function of @xmath364 and @xmath365 , @xmath366 at the stable dp fixed point , this relation between the three quantities must have scaling form . using the critical dp exponents , eq . 
 ( [ krit - ex ] ) , and exploiting that @xmath367 at the fixed line @xmath313 which contains the stable fixed point , we obtain from the flow equations ( [ flow ] ) the fixed point flow    [ flow1 ] @xmath368    with the rg flow - parameter @xmath369 defined by @xmath370 . the scaling form of the equation of state follows now from the solutions of the flow equations , and @xmath371 . after elimination of the flow parameter @xmath369 , and the redefinitions @xmath372 , etc . 
 , we get the equivalent scaling forms @xmath373 where the subscript @xmath374 indicates the sign of @xmath329 . 
 note that this field theoretic result is fully consistent with the mean - field equation of state as stated in eq . 
 ( [ spl ] ) .    written in its scaling forms  ( [ eq - state1 ] ) , 
 the equation of state leads to the following observations , see fig . 
 ( [ fig : phasediag ] ) : the region of the phase diagram corresponding to dp is given by @xmath375 and @xmath376 , where the primary control parameter @xmath377 can take both signs @xcite . 
 note , however , that the stability condition , eq . 
 ( [ stabbdg ] ) restricts the variable @xmath377 in our polymer problem to @xmath378 , and @xmath379 at the collapse transition , coinciding with the dp transition point . 
 the primary control parameter here is the external field @xmath380 . 
 the dp transition point becomes now a tricritical point given by @xmath381 and @xmath382 . 
 the control parameter @xmath377 constitutes here the crossover variable which drives the critical behavior from the dp - universality class to the critical point of the dynamical yang - lee model that we have discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : noncollapsing ] . 
 hence , for @xmath357 we expect a critical line @xmath383 with @xmath384 in a region of the phase diagram not accessible for dp itself . 
 to discuss the crossover in some more detail , we note that in mean - field theory ( where @xmath385 and @xmath386 ) , the scaling functions defined by eq . 
 ( [ eq - state1 ] ) are simply given by    [ eq - state - mf ] @xmath387    these equations show the tricritical point at @xmath388 and @xmath389 . 
 the critical line is described by the branchpoint singularity at @xmath390 or @xmath391 , respectively . 
 however , mean - field theory for the crossover is applicable only for @xmath392 , where both types of polymers , collapsing and swollen , have mean - field behavior .    to determine the general form of the crossover 
 , we assume as usual that @xmath393 has in either case a singularity at same negative value @xmath394 of @xmath395 @xcite . to be specific , we assume that @xmath396 @xmath397 is the analytic part of @xmath393 at @xmath398 , in particular @xmath399 
 . @xmath400 may havefurther singularities at @xmath398 but it is assumed that @xmath401 exists . 
 @xmath198 denotes the entropic exponent of the swollen polymers , cf . 
 [ sec : noncollapsing ] . with these assumptions , 
 we find in the vicinity of the singular curve @xmath402 that @xmath403 where @xmath404 is the entropic exponent of the collapsing polymers . 
 to conclude our discussion of the crossover , we emphasize that the problem involves _ two distinct kinds of nontrivial critical behavior with different upper critical dimensions_. thus , one can not simply extract via analytical continuation @xmath0-expansion results for @xmath393 from the known results for the dp equation of state  @xcite . 
 a glance at the two - loop part of the latter shows , in deed , non - summable singularities at @xmath390 . 
 now , we turn to the scaling form of the correlation lengths , i.e. , the diverging length - scales in transversal and longitudinal direction . to this end 
 , we consider the scaling behavior of the correlation functions @xmath405 of @xmath406 fields @xmath407 and @xmath285 fields @xmath408 . 
 the rge for these correlation functions follows readily from the general rge , see eqs . 
 ( [ inv - rge - diff ] ) and ( [ inv - rg - feld ] ) . at the stable dp fixed point with @xmath409 , @xmath345 , 
 this rge reads @xmath410 
 g_{k,\tilde{k } } ( \{\mathbf{x},t\},y , h)=0\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] via solving rge  ( [ rgecorrfkt ] ) , we obtain the scaling forms @xmath411 of the correlation functions , where @xmath412 and @xmath413 are scaling functions with the subscript @xmath374 denoting again the sign of @xmath329 . 
 note that we need @xmath414 , for @xmath415 outside the physical region of dp . 
 this scaling form implies the following scaling forms for the correlation lengths in the transversal and longitudinal directions ,    [ length - scales ] @xmath416    with scaling functions @xmath417 and @xmath418 with an analogous crossover behavior as discussed for the equation of state . 
 our field theory of sec  [ sec : fieldtheory ] provided us with a number of results , in particular the scaling form of the equation of state and the correlation lengths . 
 though certainly interesting in their own right as they stand , they are not yet in a form or language that is customary in polymer theory . here 
 , we translate our results into results for the animal numbers and the radii of gyration .    as discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : towardsfieldtheory ] , the number of different polymer configurations @xmath419 for large @xmath1 is up to an nonuniversal exponential factor @xmath67 proportional to @xmath58 , and the relation of the latter to @xmath93 via inverse laplace led asymptotically to eq .  ( [ probab_n ] ) . 
 now we recall that @xmath93 is linearly related to @xmath420 , and revisit our result ( [ eq - state1 ] ) for the equation of state which we rewrite as @xmath421 inserting this into the inverse laplace transformation  ( [ probab_n ] ) , we obtain for @xmath422 the following scaling form for the animal numbers : @xmath423 with the animal exponent @xmath6 which is the same as the entropic exponent defined in eq . 
 ( [ thetadef ] ) , and the crossover exponent @xmath424    we see here at the instance of the animal numbers , that the transcription of the field theoretic scaling result to the corresponding scaling result in the polymer language asymptotically for @xmath52 via inverse laplace transformation amounts to simply replacing @xmath425 by @xmath426 , see also the second part of eq . 
 ( [ probab_n ] ) . in this way , after the inverse laplace transformation of the correlation functions , space- and time - coordinates , which originally scale with the correlation lengths , now scale with the appropriate powers of @xmath1 . 
 consequently , we obtain for the longitudinal and the transversal radii of gyration as counterparts of the correlation lenghts    @xmath427    with critical exponents    @xmath428    where @xmath95 is once again the dynamical exponent of dp which should not de confused with the variable @xmath95 introduced through the laplace transformation .    it remains to state the @xmath0-expansions results for the polymer exponents encountered in this section . using the relations of these exponents to the dp - exponents , which are known to second order in @xmath0  @xcite 
 , we obtain    @xmath429\,,\\ \phi &   = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{18}\big[1+\ldots\big]\,,\\ \nu_{a,\vert }   &   = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{24}\big[1+\big(\frac { 13}{288}-\frac{55}{144}\ln(4/3)\big)\varepsilon+\ldots\big]\,,\\ \nu_{a,\bot }   &   = \frac{1}{4}+\frac{\varepsilon}{32}\big[1+\big(\frac{43}{288}-\frac{17}{144}\ln(4/3)\big)\varepsilon+\ldots\big]\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in table  [ table : cdbpexponents ] , we compare these @xmath0-expansions to results of numerical simulations as listed , e.g. , in the review - article of hinrichsen @xcite or the recent book of henkel , hinrichsen , and lbeck @xcite , which , of course , are obtained by simulations of the dp - transition , and not for the polymer problem itself . down to @xmath201 , 
 the agreement between field theory and simulations is remarkably good .

 in summary , we have developed a model for directed branched polymers in the framework of dynamical field field theory . 
 as far as mean - field theory was concerned , our model reproduced a number of well known results and , therefore , passed important consistency checks . 
 the same holds true for the field theory of swollen directed branched polymers which we extracted from our general model . 
 our main focus laid on the collapse transition of directed branched polymers for which , to our knowledge , no field theory existed hitherto . 
 we showed to arbitrary order in perturbation theory that this transition belongs to the dp universality class . because we used @xmath0-expansion 
 , we can be sure about the stability of the dp fixed - point only for those dimensions for which the @xmath0-expansion is valid . given that it is known from earlier work that the collapse transition of directed branched polymers belongs to the dp universality class in @xmath8-dimensions and that our present work shows that this is also the case in the vicinity of the upper critical dimension @xmath464 , we are led to expect that this holds true in any dimension . 
 we calculated the scaling behavior of several quantities of potential experimental relevance such as gyration radii and the probability distribution for finding a polymer consisting of @xmath1 monomers . 
 this work was supported in part ( o.s . ) by the national science foundation under grant no . 
 dmr 0804900 . 
 in this appendix we provide some details of our 1-loop calculation . 
 the diagrammatic elements entering this calculation are the gaussian propagator @xmath465 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] the correlator @xmath466 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] and the three - leg vertices @xmath467 , @xmath468 and @xmath469 , see fig . 
 [ fig : elemente ] .        as usual , we concentrate on those vertex functions that are superficially divergent in the ultraviolet . these are @xmath470 , @xmath471 , @xmath472 , @xmath473 , @xmath474 and @xmath475 . 
 the diagrammatic contributions to these vertex functions to 1-loop order are collected in fig . 
 [ fig:1-loop ] .        to give an example for the calculation of the various 1-loop contributions , let us consider the diagram 3(c ) . 
 the mathematical expression for this diagram is @xmath476 \nonumber \\ & \times \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d } \int d^d k \ ,   \exp \left [   - \lambda \left (   { \bm{{\rm k}}}^2 + ( { \bm{{\rm q } } } + { \bm{{\rm k } } } ) ^2 \right ) t \right ] \nonumber\\ & + ( \omega \to - \omega),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the last term indicates that this diagram can also be drawn with the arrows on the propagators pointing to the right which corresponds to the first term with @xmath477 replaced by @xmath478 . the momentum and time integrations are straightforward . 
 they lead to @xmath479^{1-\varepsilon/2 } \nonumber\\ & + ( \omega \to - \omega).\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath0-expansion finally produces @xmath480 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have omitted finite contributions that are inconsequential for our quest . 
 note that the contributions proportional to @xmath477 cancel as it should be the case . 
 note also that this diagram contributes a term proportional to @xmath481 to @xmath471 . 
 a similar situation occurs for the collapse transition of isotropic randomly branched polymers . 
 this and the renormalization mandated by it was overlooked in previous work @xcite and hence led to incorrect results . 
 the remaining diagrams in fig . 
 [ fig:1-loop ] can be calculated by similar means . to save space 
 , we merely list here the so - obtained results for the as yet unrenormalized vertex functions :    @xmath482    it can easily be checked that these results satisfy the ward identities discussed in sec . 
 [ subsec : wardetc ] . 
 application of the renormalization scheme  ( [ ren ] ) leads to renormalized vertex functions    @xmath483    and then finally to the 1-loop results for the renormalization factors and additive counter - terms stated in eq . 
 ( [ ren-1l ] ) . 
 in this appendix , we briefly discuss essential singularities appearing in the generating function @xmath93 for @xmath359 while crossing the separation line between regions iii and iv in the phase diagram , fig .  [ 
 fig : phasediag ] . 
 these singularities produced by instantons are intimately related to the well known so - called false - vacuum problem @xcite . 
 they lead to the behavior @xmath484 \label{essp}\ ] ] of the distribution function @xmath485 with @xmath486 and a nonuniversal amplitude @xmath71 . 
 our discussion follows that of harris and lubensky @xcite , and lubensky and mckane @xcite which are based on langers classical paper @xcite on the droplet model . 
 we have shown in the main text that the universal critical behavior of collapsing directed branched polymers is equivalent to that of dp . 
 being interested in essential singularities , we are hence led here to studying the behavior of the cluster distribution function of finite dp - clusters in the active phase above the transition point ( where also an infinite cluster in time and space is generated with finite probability ) .

 however , if we cross the border line at @xmath497 and go to small @xmath498 , the mean field solution becomes a false vacuum . at first sight 
 , the saddle point solution ( @xmath499 , @xmath500 ) appears to be the true vacuum . 
 however , the response field has to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath501 when the space coordinate or time tend to infinity .

 the goldstone - mode eigenvalues have not yet been calculated , as far as we know , and their calculation represents an interesting and challenging opportunity for future work .    finally , we return to the cluster distribution function @xmath485 , eq .

80,"the escape of stars from clusters is a long - standing problem in the study of dynamical evolution of star clusters . 
 the theory for the escape was first developed by @xcite and @xcite . 
 it is based on the assumption that distant encounters between cluster stars will gradually set up a maxwellian velocity distribution . 
 some stars have escape velocity of the cluster and they escape . 
 the timescale that the distant encounters set up a maxwellian velocity distribution corresponds to the two - body relaxation timescale ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number density of stars , @xmath6 is the mass of the cluster stars , @xmath7 is the average velocity of the stars , @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath9 is the coulomb logarithm . 
 every time the two - body relaxation time elapses , a cluster loses constant fraction of stars which have escape velocity . 
 therefore , the mass loss timescale of a cluster is proportional to the two - body relaxation time . 
 this theoretical argument was confirmed by @xcite ( hereafter , b01 ) in the absence of the external tidal field . 
 he performed @xmath0-body simulations of evolution of star clusters , and showed that the mass loss of the cluster happened on the two - body relaxation timescale for energy cutoff clusters , and on the two - body relaxation with backscattering correction for radial ( spatial ) cutoff clusters . 
 however , the mass loss timescale from the clusters in external tidal field is remained unclear . 
 the collaborative experiments @xcite demonstrated that the mass loss timescale does not scale with the two - body relaxation timescale , where multi - mass clusters moving in a steady tidal field were simulated . 
 it turns out that the complication is due to the existence , at the initial setup , of population of stars that have energies above the escape energy and remain in a cluster before finding exits (  potential escapers  ) . 
 @xcite ( hereafter , fh ) quantified the escape timescale of the potential escaper as a function of energy , and pointed out the escape timescale of the potential escaper is long enough to influence the whole mass loss timescale of clusters . 
 b01 performed @xmath0-body simulations of star clusters , where equal - mass clusters of @xmath10 king profiles @xcite evolve in the steady external tidal field . 
 he investigated the dependence of mass loss timescale on two - body relaxation times using simulations whose particle numbers are @xmath11 to @xmath12 . 
 he found that the mass loss timescale of clusters , @xmath1 , are proportional to , @xmath13 , the half - mass relaxation time to the power of @xmath14 , where the half - mass relaxation time is given by @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath0 is the number of stars , @xmath16 is the half - mass radius , and @xmath17 @xcite . 
 @xcite found almost the same scaling law for multi - mass clusters in time - dependent tidal field . 
 however , the @xmath18 scaling is not convinced as an asymptotic behavior at larger @xmath0 ( or @xmath19 ) for the following reason . in the limit of large @xmath0 , 
 the two - body relaxation timescale , @xmath19 , is much longer than the escape time delay , @xmath20 , which is the duration from the moment when the star gets energy above the escape energy to that when it actually escapes from the cluster . 
 therefore , the mass loss timescale should be determined only by the half - mass relaxation time , i.e. @xmath21 .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the @xmath18 scaling obtained by b01 is an asymptotic behavior by means of @xmath0-body simulations . 
 we perform sets of simulations of star clusters whose two - body relaxation timescale is larger than that of b01 and that are in the external tidal field with different strength . 
 the structure of the paper is as follows . 
 we describe in detail the model of the cluster in section 2 . 
 we show the results of @xmath0-body simulations in section 3 . 
 section 4 is for discussion . in section 5 , 
 we summarize this paper . 
 we investigate the evolution of star clusters in the external tidal field by means of @xmath0-body simulations . 
 we adopt the conventional model in which the cluster is assumed to move on a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric galaxy potential , taken to be that of a distant point mass @xmath22 . 
 we set the initial center of mass of the cluster at the origin @xmath23 , with axes oriented so that the position of the galactic center is @xmath24 . 
 we assume that the size of the globular cluster is much smaller than @xmath25 . 
 if the globular cluster rotates around the galactic center at an angular velocity @xmath26 , the equation of motion of an individual cluster member can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the @xmath29-th particle , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are unit vectors that point along the @xmath32 , @xmath33 axes , respectively . 
 the first term on the right - hand side in equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) is the gravitational acceleration from other particles in the cluster , the second term is the coriolis acceleration , and the third term is a combination of the centrifugal and tidal forces . 
 we used standard units @xcite , such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the initial total mass and @xmath36 is the initial total energy within the cluster . in our simulations we used a softened gravitational potential expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is mass of @xmath39-th particle and @xmath40 is a softening parameter . 
 we set the softening parameter , @xmath40 , as @xmath41 .    [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ tab : devi ]    as can be seen from figure [ fig3 ] , a cluster in stronger tidal field lose its mass sooner . 
 the difference of the mass loss timescale is considered to be due to the difference of the escape energy ( the potential height at the lagrangian point ) , which is lower for a cluster in stronger tidal field . 
 figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows change in energy of an individual star for k3r1.0 and k3r2.2 models ( @xmath42 ) . in figure [ fig : fig4 ] we plot @xmath43 , the median value of the maximum energy records at a given time , @xmath44 ; @xmath45 @xmath46 of randomly selected 50 particles , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 components of velocity of @xmath29-th particle , respectively . 
 we do not update @xmath53 after stars escape from the cluster . 
 the representative value , @xmath43 , may trace the energy acquired by two - body relaxations , on average . 
 when stars obtain enough energy , they escape from cluster eventually . 
 the dashed lines indicate the escape energy of each models , expressed as @xmath54    ( 120mm,75mm)figure4.eps    as shown in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , the increase of @xmath55 at @xmath56 is very similar among models k3r1.0 and k3r2.2 , which indicates that the relaxation processes in both models occur with almost the same timescale . 
 however , because the escape energy in weaker tidal field is larger , it takes more time for a significant fraction of stars to escape in model k7r2.2 than in model k7r1.0 . 
 figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows logarithmic slopes , @xmath57 , of the dependence on @xmath2 of the mass loss timescale shown in figure [ fig3 ] . actually , we calculated the logarithmic slope @xmath58 using a relation ; @xmath59}{\log_{10}[t_{\rm rh , i}/(t_{\rm rh , i}/2)]},\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the mass loss timescale when the initial half - mass relaxation timescale is @xmath2 . 
 ( 120mm,75mm)figure5.eps    as can be seen in figure [ fig : fig5 ] , the logarithmic slope depends on the the strength of external tidal field . in model k3r1.0 , where the initial distribution ( @xmath10 king model ) and the tidal field ( @xmath61 ) are set to be the same as in b01 , we reproduce the asymptotic power , @xmath62 , obtained by him . note that the initial half - mass relaxation timescale of the run with the largest @xmath0 in b01 is about @xmath63 . on the other hands , when the tidal field is stronger ( model k3r0.8 ) the slope is smaller [ @xmath64 , and when it is weaker ( models k3r1.3 , k3r2.2 , and k3r4.5 ) the slope is larger than @xmath65 . 
 the slope @xmath58 for the models in much weaker tidal field ( more k3r2.2 and k3r4.5 ) seems to approach asymptotically @xmath66 , not @xmath67 . 
 the dependence of the slope is considered to be associated with the population of the potential escaper . 
 for the clusters whose initial half - mass relaxation timescale is smaller ( or smaller @xmath0 ) , the escape time delay due to the potential escaper delays more the total mass loss of clusters . 
 figure [ fig : fig6 ] shows the evolution of the fraction of potential escapers @xmath68 in the king @xmath10 cluster models ( @xmath69 , except for model k3r4.5 , @xmath70 ) . 
 we can see that as the slope @xmath71 shown in figure [ fig : fig5 ] decreases , the fraction @xmath68 increases . 
 ( 110mm,70mm)figure6.eps      we investigate the dependence of the mass loss timescale on initial concentration of the cluster profile with @xmath10 and @xmath72 king profiles . 
 figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows the mass loss timescale , @xmath1 , as a function of the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , for models k3r1.0 , k3r2.2 , k7r1.0 and k7r2.2 . in the models k7r1.0 and k7r2.2 , the initial half - mass relaxation timescale is estimated as @xmath73 . 
 the initial half - mass radii in the standard unit are @xmath74 , for @xmath75 . 
 as seen in figure [ fig : fig7 ] , the differences between models k3r1.0 and k7r1.0 and between models k3r2.2 and k7r2.2 are small , which means the mass loss timescale does not depend so much on the concentration of the cluster . 
 figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows the logarithmic slope , @xmath76 [ @xmath77 ] . 
 ( 120mm,75mm)figure7.eps    ( 120mm,75mm)figure8.eps 
 we discuss on the small @xmath2 ( or small @xmath0 ) limit of the mass loss timescale , @xmath1 , of clusters . 
 when @xmath0 is small , the half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , is sufficiently small compared with the escape time delay , @xmath20 , and it is expected to dominate the total mass loss timescale , @xmath1 . in figure 
 [ fig : fig9 ] , we show the mass loss timescale of clusters scaled by the average dynamical time within the tidal radius , @xmath78 , which is expressed as @xmath79 and listed in table [ tab : series ] , as a function of the initial half - mass relaxation timescale for @xmath10 king cluster models . 
 the escape time delay is proportional to the average dynamical time ( fh ) . in this figure 
 , we do nt plot that for model k3r4.5 , since only this model with @xmath11 and @xmath80 experiences core collapse before the half mass is lost . 
 as can be seen in figure [ fig : fig9 ] , all of the scaled mass loss timescales , @xmath81 , approach to @xmath82 around @xmath83 , which means that the mass loss timescale is determined mainly by the averaged dynamical timescale or escape time delay in small @xmath2 ( or small @xmath0 ) limit . 
 ( 120mm,75mm)figure9.eps      in section 1 , we conjecture that the mass loss timescale should be determined only by the two - body relaxation timescale at its large limit . 
 our simulation results show that when the external tidal field is not strong ( ex . model k3r2.2 ) the mass loss timescale is almost proportional to the half - mass relaxation timescale 
 . however , its logarithmic slope seems to converge to slightly small value , @xmath66 . here , we discuss origins of the small value @xmath84 . 
 one possible answer is that the two - body relaxation timescale we used may not correctly scale the real relaxation process occurred in the cluster . 
 another possible answer is that our simulation time span may be still not long enough to exclude the influence of the escape time delay on the mass loss timescale . 
 our simulation result and analytical estimate appear to favor the later possibility . 
 figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows evolution of the lagrangian radii as a function of time scaled by the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 for model k3r2.2 with @xmath85 . 
 we can see that the @xmath86 lagrangian radii of clusters with different @xmath0 are in good agreement , which indicates that the half - mass relaxation time is surely a good measure of the internal relaxation process . 
 we estimate distribution of the escape time delay in model k7r2.2 using the results of fh , which gave the distribution of escape time delay for fixed king potential in @xmath61 tidal field . according to this paper , 
 the fraction of the initial potential escapers staying in a cluster , @xmath87 , is expressed by @xmath88 ( 1 + 3.96 \omega t { \hat{e}}^2)^{-0.729 } + f_{\rm non } ( \hat{e } ) \biggr\ } , \label{eq : delay}\ ] ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the energy of a potential escaper , @xmath91 is the fraction of the initial potential escapers , and @xmath92 is the fraction of non - escaper , which can not escape from the cluster due to the regular orbits , in the initial potential escapers . 
 we took @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 as representative values of @xmath99 . 
 figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the distribution of escape time delay equation ( [ eq : delay ] ) . in this figure we can see that at @xmath100 , which corresponds to the maximum of our simulation span , only half of the initial potential escapers have been depleted . 
 this means that the mass loss timescale , @xmath1 , of clusters are still affected not only by the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , but by the escape time delay , @xmath20 within our simulation span . 
 at least , 10 times simulation span may require to exclude the influence of the escape time delay . 
 ( 120mm,75mm)figure10.eps    ( 120mm,75mm)figure11.eps 
 we investigate the evolution of star clusters in external tidal field by means of @xmath0-body simulations . 
 we follows evolution of seven sets of clusters , whose dimensionless central potential , @xmath101 , of clusters and the strength of external tidal field are different . 
 our main conclusions are the following :    * the mass loss timescale depends on the strength of external tidal field . 
 * the logarithmic slopes , @xmath58 [ @xmath102 , also depend on the strength of external tidal field . in model k3r1.0 , 
 whose run parameters are set to be the same as in b01 , we can reproduce the asymptotic power , @xmath62 . however , when the tidal field is stronger ( model k3r0.8 ) the slope is smaller [ @xmath64 , and when it is weaker ( models k3r1.3 , k3r2.2 , and k3r4.5 ) the slope is larger than @xmath65 . 
 the slope @xmath58 for the models in much weaker tidal field ( more k3r2.2 and k3r4.5 ) is seen to approach asymptotically to near unity , but exactly @xmath66 . 
 * the mass loss timescale is almost independent of the dimensionless central potential , @xmath101 .

 we use grape-5 and the tree algorithm for the force calculations . 
 both arise artificial errors in the calculated force . 
 when calculated with grape-5 the force between two particles has a relative error of @xmath103 percent , because of the low accuracy of internal expressions in the grape-5 chip ( @xcite , @xcite ) . 
 the force calculation by the tree algorithm also contains error of similar magnitude , though it depends on the opening parameter . 
 however , such errors caused by grape-5 and the tree algorithm may not influence so much our results , because they are small compared to two - body relaxation effects @xcite , which we want to handle correctly in our simulations . 
 figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows evolution of the total mass of clusters when force calculations are done by the direct summation with and without grape-5 , model k3r2.2 ( @xmath42 ) . 
 the difference between runs with and without grape-5 is smaller than its run - to - run variation . 
 figure [ fig : fig13 ] shows evolution of the total mass calculated using direct summation and the tree algorithm ( @xmath104 ) in model k3r2.2 ( @xmath70 ) . 
 both runs used grape-5 . 
 the difference of the results is sufficiently smaller than its run - to - run variation .          in our simulations , we use the leap - frog scheme , despite of the dependence of forces on the velocities . 
 it is well - known that the nature of leap - frog scheme becomes worse in the presence of this dependence . 
 however , figure [ fig : fig14 ] shows evolutions of the total mass of clusters when @xmath105 and @xmath106 are converged , which means the leap - frog scheme with @xmath105 does not influence our results . 
 we use the potential softening for the force calculation . 
 one might suspect if the two - body relaxation does nt happen in such smoothed potential . 
 using the potential softening , close encounter between particles is surely suppressed . however , energy of particles is changed dominantly by accumulation of distant encounters , not by a few close encounters @xcite . 
 so , two - body relaxation should occur in the smoothed potential . 
 we check that the two - body relation happens with the softened potential . 
 the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the evolutions of the minimum potential in the clusters , @xmath107 , as a function of time scaled by the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , in the clusters of model k3r2.2 of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . 
 the central potential decreases owing to the two - body relaxation effect . 
 as seen in the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig15 ] , these curves are in good agreement and evolution of the central potential is scaled by the two - body relaxation timescale . 
 the lower panel of figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the evolutions of @xmath107 in the clusters of model k3r2.2 of @xmath70 and @xmath110 as a function of timescale by the two - body relaxation timescale [ equation ( [ eq : smoothed ] ) ] . 
 these curves are also in good agreement , which indicates that even with a softened potential , two - body relaxation occurs on the half - mass relaxation timescale , described by equation ( [ eq : smoothed ] ) .

81,"in @xcite d. mumford introduced the notion of a categorical quotient for the action of an algebraic group @xmath0 on an algebraic variety @xmath1 . by definition 
 this is a @xmath0invariant morphism @xmath2 such that every @xmath0invariant morphism from @xmath1 to some algebraic variety factors uniquely through @xmath3 . in general , such a categorical quotient need not exist . in this article 
 we will consider subtorus actions on complex toric varieties .    in this setting , 
 a natural candidate for a categorical quotient has been constructed in the category of toric varieties , namely the so  called _ toric quotient _ ( see @xcite ) . 
 the toric quotient is universal for toric morphisms from the given toric variety that are constant on the orbits of the subtorus action . clearly , a necessary condition for the toric quotient to be categorical is surjectivity . 
 but there are examples of toric quotients that are not surjective and hence not categorical . 
 in fact , in @xcite , section  5 , an example of a subtorus action on a toric variety is given that does not admit a categorical quotient , not even in the category of algebraic or analytic spaces . 
 on the other hand , if the codimension of @xmath4 in the big torus @xmath5 of the toric variety is at most @xmath6 , then the toric quotient is always categorical ( corollary 4.3 in @xcite ) . 
 an important tool for the proof was to observe that the toric quotient in that case is _ weakly proper _ , i.e.  it satisfies a certain weak lifting property for holomorphic germs of curves ( the precise definition is given in section  1 ) .    a morphism of complex algebraic varieties is weakly proper if and only if it is universally submersive . 
 another more geometric characterization is given by the following notion : we say that a morphism @xmath2 of algebraic varieties satisfies the _ curve covering property _ 
 if for every curve @xmath7 there is a ( not necessarily irreducible ) curve @xmath8 with @xmath9 , such that the morphism from @xmath10 to @xmath11 defined by @xmath3 has finite fibers . 
 if in addition the curve covering property is preserved under any base change , then the morphism @xmath3 has the _ universal curve covering property_. if @xmath3 is a surjective morphism over the field of complex numbers then this property is equivalent to weak properness ( see section  1 ) .    for a toric morphism , 
 weak properness has a very simple characterization in terms of fans , namely the property holds if and only if the associated lattice homomorphism induces a surjective map on the supports of the corresponding fans ( see section  2 ) .    in this article 
 we will show that weak properness is a sufficient condition for a toric quotient of expected dimension to be categorical . 
 more precisely , our main result is the following ( see corollary [ hauptergebnis ] ) :    theorem . 
 _ for a toric variety @xmath1 and a subtorus @xmath4 of the big torus @xmath5 of @xmath1 , let @xmath2 denote the toric quotient for the action of @xmath4 on @xmath1 . 
 if @xmath3 is weakly proper and @xmath12 , then the toric quotient is categorical . _    for example , weak properness is automatically satisfied if the fan associated to @xmath1 has a convex support , or equivalently , if there is a proper toric morphism from @xmath1 onto an affine toric variety . 
 in fact , we can even show that in this case the dimension condition can be omitted ( see corollary [ convex case ] ) :    theorem . 
 _ if the toric variety @xmath1 corresponds to a fan with convex support , then for any subtorus action on @xmath1 the toric quotient is a quotient in the category of algebraic varieties . _    in order to prove our results we proceed by induction on the number of steps occuring in the construction of the toric quotient . 
 the intermediate steps of this construction can be viewed as successive approximations of the quotient by non - separated prevarieties ( see section  6 ) . 
 therefore it simplifies the arguments to work in the more general context of toric prevarieties . 
 we prove a result stated in this context ( see theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] ) and obtain the above theorems as corollaries . 
 toric prevarieties are the non  separated analogues of toric varieties , i.e.  complex algebraic prevarieties with an effective action of a torus having a dense orbit . in analogy to the separated case , there is a convex 
 geometrical description of toric prevarieties in terms of so  called _ systems of fans _ 
 ( see @xcite ) . in section  2 
 we briefly recall the basic facts on toric prevarieties and systems of fans . 
 in section  3 we consider morphisms from toric prevarieties to algebraic varieties that are not necessarily toric . 
 every such morphism defines an equivalence relation on the cones occuring in the system of fans corresponding to the toric prevariety , and the supports of the equivalence classes form a partition of the support of the system of fans . 
 the properties of this partition are analyzed in section  4 and  5 . 
 these sections contain the convex 
 geometrical lemmata that are needed for the proof of the main theorem that is carried out in section  6 .    as an application of the result , in section  7 we give an example of a categorical quotient @xmath2 of a @xmath13dimensional toric variety by some @xmath14action where @xmath15 that is not uniform in the sense of @xcite , i.e. such that for some open subset @xmath16 , the restriction @xmath17 is not the categorical quotient for the induced @xmath14action . 
 in this section we recall the definition of weak properness given in @xcite , and we give another interpretation of this notion in terms of a certain curve covering property . 
 we start with the curve covering property , and we first consider algebraic prevarieties defined over an arbitrary algebraically closed field @xmath18 . following the terminology used e.g.  in @xcite , we do not require a prevariety to be irreducible . 
 when we speak of a curve in a prevariety we mean a closed algebraic subset of pure dimension @xmath19 . 
 so a curve in this sense is also not necessarily irreducible . 
 let @xmath20 be a morphism of prevarieties . 
 we say that @xmath3 satisfies the _ curve covering property _ 
 ( ccp ) if for every irreducible curve @xmath7 and every @xmath21 there is an irreducible curve @xmath8 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 is dense in @xmath11 . 
 if the curve covering property remains true even after any base change then we say that @xmath3 satisfies the _ universal curve covering property_.    every surjective proper morphism of prevarieties satisfies the universal curve covering property . 
 let @xmath2 be a proper surjective morphism . 
 consider an irreducible curve @xmath11 in @xmath24 and a point @xmath21 . 
 choose an irreducible curve @xmath10 in @xmath1 such that @xmath23 is dense in @xmath11 . since @xmath3 is proper , the curve @xmath10 must intersect the fiber of @xmath25 .    in fact , the curve covering property is nothing but a geometric characterization of submersiveness :    [ ccp = submersiv ] a surjective morphism @xmath2 of algebraic prevarieties satisfies the curve covering property if and only if it is submersive , i.e. if @xmath24 carries the quotient topology with respect to @xmath3 . 
 first suppose that the ( ccp ) holds , and consider a subset @xmath16 whose preimage @xmath26 is open in @xmath1 . 
 let us assume that the complement @xmath27 is not closed and choose a point @xmath28 . since @xmath29 is constructible , there is an irreducible curve @xmath30 through @xmath25 such that @xmath31 is open and dense in @xmath32 . using the ( ccp ) we can find an irreducible curve @xmath33 meeting the fiber @xmath34 in a point @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is dense in @xmath32 . 
 that implies @xmath37 contradicting the assumption that @xmath38 is closed . 
 conversely suppose that @xmath3 is submersive and consider an irreducible curve @xmath32 through a point @xmath25 in @xmath24 . 
 since @xmath3 is surjective , the fiber of @xmath25 is not empty . 
 moreover , since @xmath39 is not closed , the assumption implies that its preimage @xmath40 is also not closed . 
 so there is a point @xmath35 in the fiber of @xmath25 which is contained in the closure of @xmath41 . 
 this implies that there is a curve @xmath42 through @xmath35 in @xmath43 intersecting the fiber of @xmath25 only in a finite number of points . 
 so the ( ccp ) is fulfilled . 
 an example of a surjective morphism that does not satisfy the curve covering property is the following :    let @xmath1 denote the blow  up of @xmath44 in the origin , and let @xmath45 be the point corresponding to the @xmath46axis in the exceptional line . then the morphism @xmath47 defined by contracting the exceptional line is surjective . 
 but there is no curve in @xmath48 covering the @xmath46axis near the origin . 
 here is an example of a surjective morphism with curve covering property but such that the ( ccp ) does not hold universally . 
 let @xmath1 denote the simple nodal curve in @xmath44 defined by the equation @xmath49 . 
 its normalization is given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 . 
 the map @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 is surjective and the ( ccp ) holds . but 
 base change of @xmath3 via @xmath53 leads to a map that does not have the ( ccp ) :    the fiber product of @xmath54 and @xmath55 over @xmath1 is the reducible subvariety @xmath56 of @xmath44 , and for the projection @xmath57 onto the first factor the ( ccp ) does not hold .    from now on let us assume that all prevarieties are defined over @xmath58 . in this case 
 the universal curve covering property has a local interpretation in terms of holomorphic germs of curves , and for this purpose we recall some definitions from @xcite 
 . a _ local curve _ in @xmath59 is defined to be a holomorphic mapping germ @xmath60 where @xmath10 is an algebraic curve in @xmath1 through @xmath35 . 
 let @xmath20 be a regular map of prevarieties . 
 we say that a local curve @xmath61 in @xmath59 is a _ 
 weak @xmath3lifting _ of a local curve @xmath62 in @xmath63 ( where @xmath7 is a curve through @xmath25 ) if there is a non  constant holomorphic mapping germ @xmath64 and a commutative diagram @xmath65^{\t{\gamma } } \ar[d]_{\alpha } &   x'_{x } \ar[d]^{p } \cr   \cc_{0 } \ar[r]^{\gamma } & y'_{y } } \ ] ] the map @xmath3 is called _ weakly proper _ , if any local curve in @xmath24 admits a weak @xmath3lifting . a similar notion in the context of algebraic spaces 
 was introduced by kollr , the so - called weak lifting property for discrete valuation rings ( see @xcite , section  3 ) .    for a surjective morphism @xmath2 of complex algebraic prevarieties 
 the following conditions are equivalent :    1 . 
 @xmath3 is weakly proper . 
 @xmath3 has the universal curve covering property . 
 @xmath3 is submersive , and this property is preserved by every base change . 
 first note that surjectivity is preserved under base change . 
 so the equivalence of the last two statements follows from the lemma  [ ccp = submersiv ] . 
 moreover , note that weak properness is preserved under base change and clearly implies the ( ccp ) . 
 that shows that ( i ) implies ( ii ) . 
 now let us assume ( ii ) and conclude ( i ) . 
 without loss of generality we can also assume that @xmath24 is separated . 
 let @xmath66 be a local curve through a point @xmath67 , let @xmath32 denote the zariski closure of the image of @xmath66 in @xmath24 . 
 the local curve @xmath66 factors through the normalization @xmath68 , and after a base change we can achieve that @xmath24 is normal and @xmath19-dimensional .    by assumption there is a point @xmath35 in the fiber of @xmath25 and an irreducible curve @xmath42 through @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is dense in @xmath24 . consider the normalization @xmath69 of @xmath42 , and choose a point @xmath70 above @xmath35 . 
 we have an induced dominant morphism from @xmath69 to @xmath24 mapping @xmath71 to @xmath25 . 
 now we can argue locally in the analytic category . 
 the germs @xmath72 and @xmath73 are smooth and hence isomorphic to @xmath74 . 
 the holomorphic germ of the morphism @xmath3 looks like the germ @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 for some @xmath77 , and similarly the germ of @xmath66 is of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 for some @xmath80 . 
 since both germs commute , one can choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 to obtain the desired commutative diagram . 
 so in fact ( i ) holds . 
 as mentioned in the introduction we want to further investigate weakly proper toric quotients . the main task will be to check the defining property of a categorical quotient . in this context 
 the following factorization result is particularly useful ( see proposition 1.1 in @xcite ) :    [ factmor ] let @xmath20 be a weakly proper morphism of prevarieties , assume that @xmath24 is normal and let @xmath83 be a morphism into a variety @xmath84 . if @xmath85 is constant on the fibres of @xmath3 , then there is a unique morphism @xmath86 such that @xmath87 . 
 @xmath88    note that for open surjections the above result is well  known ( see e.g. @xcite , ii.6.2 ) . 
 however , the statement is not true in general for arbitrary morphisms  @xmath3 . 
 we now come to the toric setting . 
 since for the proof of our main result we need the non - separated analogues of toric varieties , here we first briefly summarize the basic facts about toric prevarieties . 
 then we state the characterization of weak properness in terms of fans .    by definition a _ 
 toric prevariety _ is a normal prevariety together with an effective action of an algebraic torus having a dense orbit . 
 we also fix an embedding of the torus @xmath5 in the toric prevariety @xmath1 and denote the point in @xmath1 corresponding to the identity element by @xmath89 . a morphism @xmath90 of toric prevarieties with tori @xmath5 and @xmath91 respectively is called a toric morphism if @xmath85 maps @xmath5 into @xmath91 and is equivariant with respect to the actions of @xmath5 and @xmath91 respectively . in particular , 
 the restriction map @xmath92 is a group homomorphism , and we will refer to its kernel as the _ kernel of @xmath85 _ and denote it by @xmath93 .    as in the separated case , one can associate to each toric prevariety a convex  geometrical object . 
 more precisely , the category of toric prevarieties is equivalent to the category of affine systems of fans ( see @xcite ) . 
 let us recall the basic definitions . 
 system of fans _ in a lattice @xmath94 is a finite collection @xmath95 of fans @xmath96 in the lattice @xmath94 with @xmath97 for all @xmath98 . 
 such a system of fans is called _ affine _ if for every @xmath99 the fan @xmath100 consists of the faces of a single cone @xmath101 in @xmath94 . 
 given an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 , one can construct a toric prevariety @xmath103 with torus @xmath104 by taking the affine toric varieties @xmath105 associated to the cones @xmath101 in the lattice @xmath94 , and glueing @xmath105 and @xmath106 along the open toric subvariety corresponding to the common subfan @xmath96 of @xmath100 and @xmath107 for every @xmath108 . 
 the subfans @xmath96 induce a glueing relation on the set @xmath109 of labelled faces of the maximal cones occuring in @xmath102 , namely @xmath110 if and only if @xmath111 . 
 there is a @xmath19@xmath19correspondence between the set of equivalence classes @xmath112 and the set of @xmath5orbits in @xmath103 . 
 more precisely , every labelled face @xmath113 defines a distinguished point @xmath114 in the toric variety @xmath105 , and this point is identified with @xmath114 in @xmath106 if and only if @xmath115 . 
 therefore every equivalence class @xmath116\in\omega(\s)$ ] defines a distinguished point @xmath117}$ ] in @xmath103 , and the orbits @xmath118}$ ] , @xmath116\in\omega(\s)$ ] , form a partition of @xmath103 . 
 the orbit structure is reflected by the partial ordering on @xmath119 given by @xmath120\prec[\sigma , i]$ ] if and only if @xmath121 and @xmath120=[\tau , i]$ ] . 
 we have @xmath122 } \subset \b{t \mal x_{[\tau , j ] } } \leftrightarrow [ \tau , j ] \prec [ \sigma , i].\ ] ]    we will also need the description of toric morphisms in terms of systems of fans . for our purposes 
 however , it will suffice to consider toric morphisms from prevarieties to varieties . 
 so let @xmath103 be the toric prevariety arising from an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 and let @xmath123 denote the toric variety associated to a fan @xmath124 in a lattice @xmath125 . 
 set @xmath126 then any toric morphism @xmath127 corresponds to a lattice homomorphism @xmath128 with the property that for every @xmath129 there is a cone @xmath130 with @xmath131 . 
 ( here @xmath132 denotes the scalar extension of @xmath133 to the real vectorspaces generated by @xmath94 and @xmath125 . ) for later use we also introduce the following notation . for any given natural number @xmath134 
 , we denote the subset of @xmath134dimensional cones in @xmath135 by @xmath136 .    the _ support _ of the system of fans @xmath102 
 is defined to be @xmath137 . for toric morphisms weak 
 properness can be characterized as follows ( see proposition 1.2 in @xcite ) :    [ weakpropchar ] a toric morphism @xmath127 from a toric prevariety to a toric variety is weakly proper if and only if the associated lattice homomorphism @xmath133 induces a surjection on the supports of the corresponding systems of fans @xmath138 
 let us consider a morphism @xmath139 from a toric prevariety @xmath140 arising from an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 to an algebraic variety @xmath84 that is not necessarily toric . 
 as we will see , such a morphism defines an equivalence relation on the set @xmath135 of cones occuring in @xmath102 , and the supports of the equivalence classes form a partition of the support of @xmath102 in finitely many subsets . whether or not @xmath85 factors through a given toric morphism can be expressed in terms of this partition . 
 we will consider two elements of @xmath119 as equivalent with respect to @xmath85 if the corresponding parametrized orbits are mapped by @xmath85 to the same parametrized set in @xmath84 , or more precisely if the composition of @xmath85 with the orbit maps of the corresponding distinguished points yield the same map on @xmath5 . 
 the morphism @xmath85 induces an equivalence relation on the set @xmath119 , namely : @xmath141 \sim_f [ \sigma',j ] \quad \leftrightarrow \quad   f(t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]})=f(t\mal x_{[\sigma',j ] } )   \quad\text{for all $ t\in t$.}\ ] ]    note that if the same cone appears with two different labels in @xmath119 , @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath143 $ ] say , then @xmath142\sim_f [ \sigma , j]$ ] . 
 that is an immediate consequence of the following remark . for a cone @xmath144 , 
 let @xmath145 denote its relative interior . 
 we observe :    [ ueberlappende kegel ] if for @xmath142 $ ] , @xmath146\in \omega(\s)$ ] we have @xmath147 , then @xmath142\sim_f [ \sigma',j]$ ] . 
 choose @xmath148 . 
 let @xmath149 denote the corresponding one  parameter  subgroup of @xmath5 and fix @xmath150 . in the affine chart @xmath105 , @xmath151}$ ] 
 holds , whereas in @xmath106 we have @xmath152}$ ] . 
 since @xmath85 is continuous and we assumed @xmath84 to be separated , this implies the claim . 
 so in fact , @xmath85 induces an equivalence relation on the set @xmath135 , and we will also denote this relation by @xmath153 . 
 we define the _ support of the equivalence class _ of @xmath154 by @xmath155 as an immediate consequence of remark [ ueberlappende kegel ] we obtain the following    the subsets @xmath156 , @xmath154 , form a partition of the support of @xmath102 . 
 [ regions of tormor ] consider a fan @xmath124 in a lattice @xmath125 , and let @xmath123 denote the corresponding toric variety . 
 let @xmath157 be a toric morphism , and let @xmath128 denote the associated lattice homomorphism . 
 then the equivalence classes of @xmath135 correspond to the elements of @xmath124 that meet @xmath158 , more precisely @xmath159 if and only if there is a cone @xmath160 with @xmath161 . the supports of the equivalence classes are the sets @xmath162 , @xmath160 .    for example , 
 let us look at the toric morphism @xmath163 given by the projection on the first factor . 
 the system of fans corresponding to @xmath164 is the fan @xmath165 in @xmath166 , where @xmath167 , @xmath168 for @xmath169 , and @xmath58 arises from the fan @xmath170 in @xmath171 . 
 the lattice homomorphism corresponding to @xmath85 is the projection @xmath172 . 
 so in this case we have @xmath173 and @xmath174 . 
 the supports of the equivalence classes in @xmath175 are @xmath176 and @xmath177 .    for a given cone @xmath178 , 
 let @xmath179 denote the subtorus of @xmath5 corresponding to the sublattice obtained by intersecting @xmath94 with the linear subspace @xmath180 generated in @xmath181 by the set @xmath156 . 
 then @xmath179 is generated by all isotropy subgroups @xmath182}}$ ] , where @xmath183\in\omega(\s)$ ] and @xmath184 . 
 [ relstab ] we have @xmath185})= f(t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]})$ ] for every @xmath186 . 
 in particular , @xmath85 is invariant with respect to the action of @xmath187 .    to see this , choose cones @xmath188 in the @xmath85equivalence class of @xmath144 that are generating @xmath180 as a vector space . if @xmath189\in\omega(\s)$ ] , then @xmath190})=f(t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]})$ ] for every @xmath150 , since @xmath191 . 
 so we can conclude that @xmath192})=f(t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]})$ ] for every @xmath193 in the stabilizer @xmath194 of the point @xmath195}$ ] . 
 since the subtori @xmath194 generate @xmath179 that implies the claim . 
 let us now consider a dominating toric morphism @xmath196 to some toric variety @xmath123 , and assume that the associated lattice homomorphism @xmath197 is surjective . 
 that means that the kernel of the homomorphism of tori @xmath198 induced by @xmath199 is connected . 
 we will denote this kernel by @xmath200 . 
 assume that @xmath3 is weakly proper . 
 with the above notations we can describe the fibers of @xmath3 as follows :    [ fasern ] two points @xmath201 lie in the same fiber of p if and only if there are elements @xmath202,[\sigma_2,j]\in\omega(\s)$ ] with @xmath203 , @xmath150 and @xmath204 with @xmath205}$ ] and @xmath206}$ ] . 
 let @xmath207 denote the restriction homomorphism of @xmath3 to the big tori of @xmath103 and @xmath123 respectively . 
 any point @xmath208 is of the form @xmath209 for some @xmath210 and @xmath211 . 
 then the @xmath3-fibre of the point @xmath212 is @xmath213}\ ] ] ( see @xcite , proposition 3.5 ) . 
 as described in example [ regions of tormor ] , since @xmath3 is surjective , the given cone @xmath211 defines a @xmath3equivalence class , represented by @xmath214 say , and @xmath215}.\ ] ] to prove the lemma it suffices to show that @xmath216 first note that the subtorus @xmath217 corresponds to the sublattice of @xmath125 defined by @xmath218 . by proposition [ weakpropchar ] , 
 since @xmath3 is weakly proper we have @xmath219 . 
 that implies @xmath220 and hence @xmath221 . 
 therefore @xmath222 . since we assumed @xmath199 to be surjective , that proves the claim .    from this description of the fibers of a weakly proper toric morphism 
 we obtain the following factorization criterion . 
 [ factorization criterion ] let @xmath223 be a morphism to a variety @xmath84 , and let @xmath224 be a toric morphism with the universal curve covering property to a toric variety @xmath24 , such that @xmath225 is connected . 
 then the following statements are equivalent :    1 .   the morphism @xmath85 factors through @xmath3 . 
 2 .   @xmath226})=f(t_2\cdot x_{[\sigma_2,j]})$ ] for all @xmath202,[\sigma_2,j]\in\omega(\s)$ ] with @xmath227 and @xmath228 with @xmath229 . 
 @xmath85 is @xmath225invariant , and for @xmath230 , whenever @xmath231 then @xmath232 .    by proposition [ factmor ] , @xmath85 factors through @xmath3 if and only if @xmath85 is constant on the fibers of @xmath3 . 
 from the above description of the fibers of @xmath3 it follows immediately that ( i ) and ( ii ) are equivalent . 
 now let us assume that ( i ) holds . 
 then in particular @xmath85 is @xmath225invariant . 
 moreover , it can be read off directly from ( ii ) that @xmath159 whenever @xmath233 . 
 conversely , assume that ( iii ) holds , and let @xmath154 . 
 then the @xmath85equivalence class of @xmath144 contains the @xmath3equivalence class of @xmath144 , and hence @xmath234 . 
 now ( ii ) follows from remark [ relstab ] . 
 we want to apply this lemma to the following situation . 
 let @xmath102 be an affine system of fans in a lattice @xmath94 and let @xmath144 be a convex cone in @xmath94 , not necessarily contained in @xmath135 but with @xmath235 . 
 let @xmath236 denote the minimal face of @xmath144 . 
 then @xmath236 is a linear subspace of @xmath181 , and the sublattice @xmath237 defines a subtorus @xmath4 of the big torus of @xmath103 . 
 define a system of fans @xmath238 , in @xmath94 by setting @xmath239 and @xmath240 . 
 then the identity homomorphism @xmath241 defines a toric morphism @xmath242 , and the projection @xmath243 defines a toric morphism @xmath244 to the affine toric variety @xmath245 associated to the cone @xmath246 in @xmath247 . 
 let @xmath223 be a morphism to some variety @xmath84 , and assume that for every face @xmath248 of @xmath144 , the set @xmath249 is contained in the support of an @xmath85equivalence class of @xmath135 . 
 then the morphism @xmath85 is @xmath250invariant , and there is a unique morphism @xmath251 such that the following diagram is commutative : @xmath252^{q } \ar[dr]_{p } & x_{\s }    \ar[r]^{f } & \ z \cr & x_{p(\sigma ) } \ar[ur]_{f_{\sigma } } & \cr } \qquad.\ ] ]    the minimal face @xmath236 is a linear subspace and therefore it coincides with its relative interior . by assumption , @xmath236 
 is contained in the support of an @xmath85equivalence class , and that means , that @xmath253 . 
 therefore @xmath254 , and remark [ relstab ] implies that @xmath85 is @xmath4invariant .    by construction , @xmath199 is surjective and weakly proper . 
 so we can apply lemma [ factorization criterion ] , and conclude that the morphism @xmath255 factors uniquely through @xmath3 . 
 that means that there is a morphism @xmath251 with @xmath256 . 
 the following two sections contain preparations for the proof of the main result given in section 6 . 
 first we analyze morphisms from a toric variety corresponding to a fan with just two maximal cones in a special position . 
 [ zwei kegel ] let @xmath124 be a fan with only two maximal cones @xmath257 and @xmath258 . 
 assume that there are faces @xmath259 of @xmath260 and vectors @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 with @xmath265 . 
 let @xmath266 be a morphism such that @xmath267 
 . then @xmath268 . 
 set @xmath269 . 
 we have to show that for every @xmath150 the following holds : @xmath270 for a given @xmath150 , consider the morphism @xmath271 , defined by @xmath272 . 
 then clearly @xmath273 satisfies the same assumption as @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath274 . 
 therefore it suffices to show the claim for @xmath275 . 
 let @xmath276 denote the closure of the orbit @xmath277 in @xmath123 . 
 then @xmath276 is a toric variety with respect to the torus @xmath278 , and it corresponds to the fan obtained by projecting the star of @xmath279 in @xmath124 to @xmath280 . 
 the lattice homomorphism @xmath281 , defined by @xmath282 and @xmath283 , defines a toric morphism @xmath284 . 
 this toric morphism has the following properties : @xmath285,s)= \cases { \lambda_{v'}(r_1/r_0 ) \mal \lambda_{w}(s )    \mal x_{\rho } & if $ r_0,r_1,s \ne 0 $ , 
 \cr   \lambda_{w}(s ) \mal x_{\tau_1 } & if $ r_1= 0 $ , $ s\ne 0 $ , \cr    \lambda_{v'}(r_1/r_0)\mal x_{\sigma_1\cap\sigma_2 } &      if $ r_0,r_1\ne0 $ , $ s=0 $ \cr } \,.\ ] ]    now consider the composition @xmath286 . by definition , @xmath287 and hence @xmath288 . 
 since we assumed @xmath289 , this implies @xmath290 for all @xmath291 . 
 so @xmath292 , i.e.  @xmath293 contracts the curve @xmath294 to a point . with the following lemma [ kurvenschar ] 
 we can conclude that @xmath293 in fact does not depend on the first coordinate , and for @xmath295 we obtain that @xmath296 .    in the above proof we used a general fact about morphisms from @xmath297 . 
 [ kurvenschar ] let @xmath298 be a morphism to a variety @xmath84 with @xmath299 for some @xmath300 . 
 then @xmath293 is constant on @xmath301 for every @xmath302 , i.e. @xmath293 does not depend on the first coordinate . 
 choose an open affine neighbourhood @xmath303 of @xmath212 in @xmath84 and set @xmath304 . 
 consider the projection @xmath305 . 
 since @xmath306 is complete , @xmath307 is closed in @xmath58 . 
 moreover , we have @xmath308 . 
 so @xmath309 is an open neighbourhood of @xmath310 in @xmath58 , and by definition @xmath311 so by restriction we obtain a morphism @xmath312 . since we chose @xmath303 to be affine , @xmath293 maps @xmath313 to a point for every @xmath314 . 
 so for continuity reasons , @xmath293 does not depend on the first coordinate . 
 now we consider a system of fans @xmath102 with convex support , and a morphism @xmath223 to some variety @xmath84 . 
 we apply lemma [ zwei kegel ] to prove the following :    [ kegelabschluss ] let @xmath235 be a rational ( not necessarily strictly ) convex cone . 
 suppose that @xmath145 is contained in the support of an @xmath85equivalence class of @xmath135 . 
 then for every face @xmath248 of @xmath144 , the relative interior @xmath249 is also contained in the support of an @xmath85equivalence class .    by induction on @xmath315 
 we will show that the assertion is true for all one  codimensional faces of @xmath144 . if @xmath144 is one  dimensional there is nothing to show . 
 so assume that @xmath316 , and let @xmath248 be a face of @xmath144 of dimension @xmath317 . 
 we can assume that @xmath318 for all @xmath319 since the cones of maximal dimension cover @xmath144 . 
 we reduce the induction step to proving the following    * claim : * for every cone @xmath320 we have @xmath321    from this claim it follows that @xmath322 is relatively closed in @xmath249 . 
 the @xmath323dimensional cones in @xmath324 cover @xmath248 , and we obtain a partition of @xmath249 in relatively closed subsets of the form @xmath322 , where @xmath325 . since @xmath249 is connected this implies that one of the subsets actually equals @xmath249 , and that means that @xmath249 is contained in the support of an @xmath85equivalence class . 
 so to prove the proposition it suffices to show the claim . 
 let us assume the claim were not true . 
 then since all the cones in question are rational , we can find a rational vector @xmath326 in the boundary of @xmath327 with @xmath328 . 
 note that @xmath326 may be zero , if the cone @xmath248 is not strictly convex . 
 now choose a vector @xmath329 such that @xmath330 . 
 for sufficiently small @xmath331 the ball @xmath332 of radius @xmath331 in @xmath333 around @xmath326 is already covered by those cones in @xmath334 that contain @xmath326 . therefore if we choose @xmath335 of length @xmath336 , then @xmath337 for some @xmath338 containing @xmath326 .    moreover , for @xmath169 we can construct @xmath323dimensional rational cones @xmath339 such that @xmath340 , @xmath341 and @xmath342 is a common face of @xmath343 and @xmath344 . 
 to do so , we can first choose a hyperplane through @xmath326 separating @xmath345 and @xmath346 , and then choose appropriate simplicial rational cones around @xmath345 and @xmath346 respectively that lie entirely on one side of the hyperplane , and then form the convex hull with @xmath326 . 
 by assumption there are @xmath347dimensional cones @xmath101 and @xmath348 having @xmath327 and @xmath349 respectively as a face . now choose @xmath350 , and set @xmath351 and @xmath352 . 
 let @xmath353 denote the toric variety associated to @xmath260 in @xmath94 ( @xmath169 ) . 
 since the cone @xmath257 is contained in the cone @xmath101 , the identity on @xmath94 defines a toric morphism from @xmath354 to the affine chart @xmath355 of @xmath103 . 
 the composition with @xmath85 yields a morphism @xmath356 from @xmath354 to @xmath84 . 
 the cone @xmath258 has the following properties : @xmath357 and @xmath358 . 
 therefore the relative interior of every face of @xmath258 is contained in an @xmath85equivalence class . 
 note that @xmath258 is strictly convex , since by construction @xmath359 . 
 hence by corollary [ indmor ] , @xmath85 defines a morphism @xmath360 from @xmath361 to @xmath84 such that the following diagram is commutative : @xmath362   \ar[dr ] & x_{\s }    \ar[r]^{f } & \ z \cr & x_{\sigma_2 } \ar[ur]_{f_2 } & \cr } \qquad.\ ] ]    now consider the toric variety @xmath123 corresponding to the fan with the two maximal cones @xmath257 and @xmath258 in @xmath94 
 . it follows from the above commutative diagram that the two morphisms @xmath356 , @xmath360 coincide on the intersection of the two maximal affine charts , and so they glue together to a morphism @xmath363 . since @xmath364 , by assumption we have @xmath365 . 
 the cones @xmath260 with the faces @xmath366 satisfy all the conditions of lemma [ zwei kegel ] , and we obtain @xmath367 , where @xmath368 and hence @xmath369 . since @xmath370 , it follows that @xmath371 , which is a contradiction . 
 as in the previous section we consider a system of fans with convex support @xmath372 in a lattice @xmath94 . let @xmath373 be two cones with @xmath374 . 
 then since we assumed @xmath372 to be convex , we have @xmath375 . 
 moreover , it follows that @xmath376 . 
 a first observation is the following :    [ nachbarkegel ] let @xmath223 be a morphism from the toric prevariety @xmath103 associated to @xmath102 to some variety @xmath84 . 
 suppose that @xmath257 is a cone in @xmath135 with @xmath377 and @xmath378 
 . then @xmath379 . 
 the assumptions on @xmath257 imply that there is a face @xmath327 of @xmath257 with @xmath380 . 
 similarly , there is a face @xmath381 of @xmath144 with @xmath382 . 
 therefore @xmath383 . 
 now choose @xmath384 , and write @xmath385 in the form @xmath386 , where @xmath387 , @xmath388 . 
 suppose that @xmath142,[\tau , j],[\sigma_1,k]\in\omega(\s)$ ] and fix @xmath150 . since @xmath383 , for all @xmath389 the following holds : @xmath390})= f(t\mal\lambda_{v_1}(s)\mal   x_{[\tau , j]})= f(t\mal\lambda_{w}(s)\mal   x_{[\tau , j]})= f(t\mal\lambda_{w}(s)\mal   x_{[\tau',i]})\,.\ ] ]    in the affine chart @xmath391}$ ] we have @xmath392}=   t\mal x_{[\sigma_1,k]}$ ] . 
 on the other hand , in the affine chart @xmath393}$ ] we have @xmath394}=   t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]}$ ] . 
 that implies @xmath395})= f(t\mal x_{[\sigma , i]})$ ] for all @xmath396 , and hence @xmath397 . 
 [ kegelvergroesserung ] let @xmath95 be an affine system of fans with convex support , and let @xmath398 be cones in @xmath135 with @xmath374 . 
 then one of the following two assertions holds :    1 . 
 there is a nonzero linear subspace @xmath399 and a cone @xmath400 such that @xmath401 for every morphism @xmath223 to a variety @xmath84 , or 2 . 
 @xmath402 for every morphism @xmath223 to a variety @xmath84 . 
 we will prove the proposition by induction on the dimension of the support @xmath403 and the number @xmath404 of @xmath347dimensional cones in @xmath135 . 
 let us suppose that the first assertion does not hold . 
 note that this implies that the analogous assertion also does not hold for any system of the form @xmath405 obtained by intersecting @xmath102 with a cone @xmath406 . 
 so without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath407 . 
 moreover , it suffices to show assertion ( ii ) under the additional assumption @xmath408    to see this , suppose that ( ii ) is true whenever the extra condition ( 1 ) holds . 
 choose a ray @xmath409 and consider the cone @xmath410 . 
 our assumption implies that @xmath411 for every morphism @xmath223 to a variety @xmath84 . and if @xmath412 , then any point @xmath413 is contained in the relative interior of @xmath414 . 
 therefore we can replace @xmath248 in @xmath415 by @xmath414 , glued to any other cone along the origin only . by recursion over the rays we obtain the claim . 
 now we further reduce the situation to the special case that @xmath416    suppose that assertion ( ii ) always holds if ( 2 ) is true . 
 consider a pair of cones @xmath398 as in the proposition and satisfying condition ( 1 ) . then @xmath417 or @xmath317 , where @xmath418 . 
 choose a point @xmath419 . 
 since @xmath407 , we can find an @xmath347-dimensional cone @xmath214 containing @xmath385 such that condition ( 2 ) holds for @xmath257 and @xmath144 . 
 so using ( ii ) we may replace @xmath144 in @xmath102 by @xmath420 . 
 in other words , we can assume that @xmath421 . 
 if also @xmath248 is @xmath347-dimensional we obtain @xmath422 , and that implies condition ( 2 ) for @xmath144 and @xmath248 . 
 otherwise @xmath248 must be a facet of @xmath372 . in that case 
 consider a point @xmath412 . 
 as above we can find an @xmath347-dimensional cone @xmath423 containing @xmath326 such that condition ( 2 ) holds for @xmath327 and @xmath248 . so using ( ii ) we may assume that @xmath327 contains @xmath248 as a facet . 
 from the fact that @xmath424 we can conclude that @xmath425 meets @xmath327 in its relative interior . 
 that implies @xmath426 , and we can replace @xmath248 by @xmath327 . since @xmath427 , condition ( 2 ) follows as before .    from now on let us assume that conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are satisfied . 
 so we are left with two possibilities : either @xmath428 or @xmath429 . 
 let us first consider the case @xmath428 . if @xmath430 is convex then there is nothing to show , since then we have @xmath431 . 
 ( for consider @xmath432 . 
 then there are facets @xmath433 and @xmath434 with @xmath435 . 
 choose defining hyperplanes @xmath436 and @xmath437 with @xmath438 and @xmath439 . here 
 @xmath440 and @xmath441 denote the dual cones of @xmath144 and @xmath248 respectively . in a ball of sufficiently small radius around @xmath326 in @xmath442 
 we find a point @xmath335 with @xmath443 and @xmath444 and hence @xmath445 . 
 this shows that @xmath326 can not lie in the relative interior of @xmath430 . ) 
 so let us assume that @xmath430 is not convex . 
 then there is a facet @xmath433 , defined by a hyperplane @xmath436 such that @xmath446 and @xmath447 . 
 ( to see this , choose a point @xmath448 , @xmath449 such that the segment @xmath450 $ ] joining @xmath326 and @xmath451 intersects @xmath430 only in @xmath452 . 
 the point @xmath326 lies on a facet @xmath433 , and since @xmath453 , we can choose a defining hyperplane @xmath436 of @xmath257 such that @xmath454 . 
 on the other hand , @xmath455 , and so @xmath456 . ) 
 now we decompose @xmath457 along the defining hyperplane @xmath458 of @xmath257 . since @xmath459 and @xmath460 
 , we have @xmath461 and therefore @xmath462 . set @xmath463 
 then @xmath327 and @xmath349 are cones that intersect in the common face @xmath464 . 
 moreover , since @xmath462 , we have @xmath465 . 
 note that @xmath144 and @xmath327 are again both @xmath347dimensional cones , whose intersection is also @xmath347dimensional . 
 so in particular , @xmath466 . moreover , @xmath467 . 
 in fact , we can reduce the problem to considering the pair of cones @xmath144 and @xmath327 in @xmath468 .    because if @xmath469 is contained in the support of some @xmath85equivalence class , then it follows from proposition [ kegelabschluss ] that the same is true for its face @xmath470 . 
 this implies @xmath471 , and so by our general assumption , @xmath381 must be strictly convex . 
 it follows from our choice of @xmath472 that @xmath473 , and therefore @xmath474 . 
 consider the system of fans @xmath475 obtained from @xmath476 by adding the fan of faces of @xmath381 , and glueing @xmath381 to the other cones along the zero cone . since @xmath144 lies on the other side of the hyperplane @xmath458 , we have @xmath477 . 
 we also know that @xmath478 . 
 it follows by induction that latexmath:[$(\tau_2+\sigma_1)^{\circ}=(\tau_2+\tau')^{\circ}\subset    cones @xmath144 and @xmath327 in @xmath468 . 
 if @xmath480 is not convex , then we can again decompose @xmath481 along a defining hyperplane meeting @xmath482 and reduce the problem to considering the cone @xmath144 together with a smaller cone @xmath343 as above . after repeating this procedure a finite number of times however 
 , we arrive at a pair of cones such that their union is convex . 
 now let us consider the second case , namely that @xmath483 and @xmath484 , and suppose that @xmath485 . 
 if there is a cone @xmath486 with @xmath487 and @xmath488 , then we can conclude with the assertion in the first case applied to the pair of cones @xmath489 in @xmath490 that @xmath491 . 
 it follows again from the general assumption that @xmath492 is strictly convex . by replacing the two fans of faces of @xmath144 and @xmath493 respectively in @xmath102 by the single fan of faces of @xmath494 , where @xmath494 is glued to all the other cones only along the zero cone , 
 we obtain a system of fans @xmath475 , that contains strictly fewer @xmath347dimensional cones than @xmath102 . 
 so by induction the claim follows .    from now on , let us assume that for every cone @xmath486 that is not contained in @xmath144 , we have @xmath495 . by assumption 
 , the intersection @xmath496 contains a point of @xmath249 . 
 therefore we can find a facet @xmath257 of @xmath144 with @xmath497 and @xmath459 . 
 ( to see this , note that @xmath498 . 
 so there is a facet @xmath499 with @xmath500 . 
 since @xmath460 , where @xmath501 , @xmath502 is a facet of @xmath144 with the desired properties . )    as in the previous case , we decompose @xmath457 along a defining hyperplane of @xmath257 . 
 we set @xmath503 and observe that @xmath327 and @xmath349 are cones intersecting in the common face @xmath464 . and , since @xmath462 , we again have @xmath465 . 
 moreover , since the @xmath347dimensional cones in @xmath135 cover @xmath257 , we can choose a cone @xmath486 through a point @xmath504 , such that @xmath505 . 
 because of our assumptions on the position of the @xmath347dimensional cones relative to @xmath144 , that implies in particular that @xmath506 . 
 one consequence is that @xmath507 . 
 furthermore , the face @xmath508 of @xmath481 must be contained in an @xmath85equivalence class . since @xmath509 
 , that means @xmath471 . by lemma [ nachbarkegel ] , @xmath510 , and therefore in fact @xmath511 
 now consider the system of fans @xmath475 obtained from @xmath512 by adding the fan of faces of @xmath513 and glueing @xmath381 to the other cones along the zero cone . 
 since @xmath514 and @xmath515 , we have @xmath516 . because @xmath517 . here 
 the equality again is a consequence of lemma [ nachbarkegel ] . 
 altogether we obtain that the relative interior of the convex cone @xmath518 is contained in @xmath156 . replacing the fans of faces of @xmath144 and @xmath493 in @xmath102 as above by the fan of faces of @xmath494 , glued to the other cones along zero 
 , we end up with a system of fans @xmath519 that has strictly fewer @xmath347dimensional cones than @xmath102 . 
 so by induction , applied to the pair of cones @xmath494 and @xmath248 , the claim follows . 
 this ends the proof . 
 in this section we prove the main result of this paper , namely that if the toric quotient of a toric variety with respect to a subtorus action is weakly proper and the quotient variety is of expected dimension , then the toric quotient is even categorical .    in order to simplify our arguments 
 , we work in the more general context of toric prevarieties and obtain the announced result as a corollary of a statement in this context . 
 first we note that the construction of toric quotients given in @xcite also proves the existence of a separated quotient in the toric category for a subtorus action on a toric prevariety . 
 more precisely , we have the following :    let @xmath1 be a toric prevariety with big torus @xmath5 , and let @xmath4 be a subtorus of @xmath5 . 
 then there is an @xmath4invariant toric morphism @xmath520 to some separated toric variety @xmath24 such that every @xmath4invariant toric morphism from @xmath1 to a toric variety factors uniquely through @xmath521 . 
 if @xmath1 is separated then @xmath521 is precisely the toric quotient of @xmath1 by @xmath4 . 
 if @xmath1 is not separated , we call the morphism @xmath521 the _ separated toric quotient _ of @xmath1 by @xmath4 . 
 this statement follows directly from the existence of a quotient fan of a system of cones proved in @xcite . 
 suppose that @xmath1 arises from an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 , and let @xmath522 be the primitive sublattice of @xmath94 corresponding to @xmath4 . 
 the set @xmath135 of cones of @xmath102 satisfies the definition of a system of @xmath94cones given in @xcite . 
 therefore by theorem 2.3 of @xcite there is a well  defined fan @xmath124 in a lattice @xmath523 , the so  called _ quotient fan _ of @xmath135 by @xmath522 , satisfying the following universal property : whenever we have a fan @xmath524 in a lattice @xmath125 and a lattice homomorphism @xmath128 with @xmath525 , such that every cone of @xmath135 is mapped into a cone of @xmath524 , then there is a unique map of fans from @xmath124 to @xmath524 such that the diagram commutes . 
 if we translate this property back into the language of toric prevarieties , then we get back exactly the universal property stated in the proposition . 
 the main theorem in the context of toric prevarieties is the following :    [ weakly proper toric quotient ] let @xmath140 be a toric prevariety arising from an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 , and let @xmath4 be the subtorus corresponding to a given sublattice @xmath526 . 
 the quotient fan @xmath124 of the set @xmath135 of cones of @xmath102 is a fan in a quotient lattice @xmath527 of @xmath528 . 
 let @xmath529 and @xmath530 denote the projections . 
 if we assume @xmath531 , then the separated toric quotient @xmath532 with respect to @xmath4 has the following universal property ( ca ) : every @xmath4invariant morphism from @xmath1 to a variety factors uniquely through @xmath521 . 
 let us briefly recall the procedure to obtain the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath135 by @xmath522 as described in @xcite . 
 _ initialization : _ let @xmath529 denote the projection . 
 let @xmath533 denote the set of maximal elements of @xmath534 with respect to inclusion of sets . 
 _ loop , step @xmath535 : _ if possible choose @xmath536 such that @xmath537 is not a face of @xmath381 and let @xmath538 denote the smallest face containing @xmath537 . now set @xmath539 to be the set of maximal elements of @xmath540 . otherwise set @xmath541 and stop the procedure . 
 _ output : _ let @xmath542 be the set of all faces of the cones of @xmath543 . by construction , the set @xmath542 is a _ quasi - fan _ 
 , i.e.  the cones in @xmath542 may not be strictly convex , but otherwise all the axioms of a fan are fulfilled . 
 we call @xmath542 the quotient quasi - fan of @xmath135 by @xmath522 . 
 _ final step : _ the minimal element @xmath544 of @xmath542 is a linear subspace of @xmath545 , and @xmath546 is a sublattice . 
 let @xmath547 denote the projection 
 . then @xmath548 
 .    our main applications of theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] are the following two corollaries . 
 [ hauptergebnis ] for a toric variety @xmath1 and a subtorus @xmath4 of the big torus @xmath5 , let @xmath2 denote the toric quotient . 
 if @xmath3 is weakly proper and the quotient space @xmath24 is of expected dimension , i.e. @xmath12 , then the toric quotient is a quotient in the category of algebraic varieties . 
 suppose that @xmath1 arises from a fan @xmath549 in a lattice @xmath94 . since @xmath550 the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath549 by the lattice @xmath522 corresponding to @xmath4 lives in the space @xmath528 and @xmath551 is the identity on @xmath528 . moreover , the projection @xmath529 is the lattice homomorphism associated to the toric quotient @xmath3 . 
 so if @xmath3 is weakly proper , then by proposition  [ weakpropchar ] , we have @xmath552 , and theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] applies . 
 [ convex case ] let @xmath1 be a toric variety corresponding to a fan with convex support . 
 that means that there is a proper toric morphism from @xmath1 onto an affine toric variety . 
 then the toric quotient of @xmath1 by any subtorus of the big torus is always a quotient in the category of algebraic varieties . 
 suppose that @xmath1 arises from a fan @xmath549 with convex support . 
 then any projection from @xmath549 to a quotient quasi - fan is automatically surjective , since the cones of any quotient quasi - fan are obtained by successively forming convex hulls . 
 now we come to the proof of the main theorem . 
 proof of theorem 6.2 . 
 first we can reduce the situation to a special case . 
 let us denote by @xmath553 the largest subtorus of @xmath5 such that every @xmath4invariant morphism from @xmath1 to some variety is in fact @xmath553invariant . then in particular 
 , the separated toric quotient @xmath521 is @xmath553invariant , and that means that @xmath554 . here as before @xmath555 denotes the kernel of the homomorphism of tori induced by @xmath521 . 
 note that the separated toric quotients with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath553 coincide . 
 moreover , the assumption @xmath531 , implies that @xmath556 , where @xmath557 denotes the projection modulo the lattice @xmath558 corresponding to @xmath553 and @xmath559 the projection with @xmath560 . 
 so for this proof we can assume w.l.o.g . 
 that @xmath561 . 
 we claim that moreover we can assume @xmath562 or equivalently @xmath563 . to see this let @xmath223 be an @xmath4-invariant morphism to some variety @xmath84 . 
 consider the algebraic quotients of the affine charts @xmath564 . since any good quotient is categorical , the restriction of @xmath85 to @xmath565 factors uniquely through @xmath566 . 
 therefore we obtain morphisms @xmath567 with @xmath568 .    in particular , 
 @xmath85 is @xmath569invariant for every @xmath319 , and therefore by assumption @xmath570 for all @xmath319 . 
 that means that @xmath571 is the affine toric variety defined by the cone @xmath572 in @xmath573 , and all the cones @xmath574 are strictly convex . 
 if we glue all the affine charts @xmath575 along the open orbit @xmath576 , we obtain a toric prevariety @xmath10 that in some sense is a first non - separated approximation of the quotient variety @xmath123 . 
 the prevariety @xmath10 corresponds to the system of fans @xmath577 in @xmath125 , where @xmath578 is the fan of faces of @xmath574 and @xmath579 for all @xmath580 . 
 we can view the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath135 by @xmath522 as the quotient fan of @xmath581 by the zero lattice . 
 let @xmath582 denote the separated toric quotient of @xmath583 by the trivial group . 
 the morphisms @xmath584 coincide on the open orbit @xmath91 , and hence they glue together to a morphism @xmath585 . since for every @xmath319 , the morphism @xmath85 agrees with @xmath586 on the affine chart @xmath565 , we can conclude that @xmath85 factors through @xmath521 if and only if @xmath587 factors through @xmath588 . 
 @xmath589_q \ar[r]^f & z \cr & x_{\s ' }   \ar[ul]^{q ' } \ar[ur]_{\t{f } } & \cr } \qquad,\ ] ]    therefore from now on we may assume that @xmath590 . 
 in this case the condition in theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] says that @xmath591 . 
 let @xmath223 be a morphism to a variety . 
 let us have a closer look at the algorithmic construction of the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath415 by the zero lattice . 
 the first set @xmath533 simply consists of the maximal cones in @xmath415 . 
 let @xmath592 denote the toric prevariety obtained from the maximal affine charts of @xmath103 , but now only glued along the open orbit . 
 the identity on the affine charts induces a toric morphism @xmath593 . 
 set @xmath594 . 
 by induction on the index @xmath595 counting the steps in the algorithm we now prove the following for @xmath535 :    1 . 
 all the cones in @xmath596 are strictly convex . 
 hence we may define a toric prevariety @xmath597 from the affine toric varieties corresponding to the cones in @xmath596 by glueing them along the open orbit @xmath5 . 
 there is a morphism @xmath598 such that we have a commutative diagram @xmath599^{f_{l-1 } } \ar[d]_{p_l } & \ z \cr x_{l } \ar[ur]_{f_l } & \cr } \qquad,\ ] ] where @xmath600 denotes the toric morphism induced by the identity on @xmath94 . 
 so let @xmath535 , and assume that the induction hypothesis is fulfilled for all previous steps . 
 suppose that @xmath596 was obtained from @xmath601 by replacing a cone @xmath602 by @xmath603 , where @xmath604 such that @xmath605 . 
 then in particular , @xmath606 . 
 let @xmath607 denote the system of fans associated to @xmath597 . by the general assumption , @xmath608 and hence @xmath609 . since we assumed that @xmath610 , we can apply proposition [ kegelvergroesserung ] to @xmath611 to conclude that @xmath612 . 
 so by proposition [ kegelabschluss ] , the relative interior of any face of @xmath613 is contained in some @xmath614equivalence class . 
 if @xmath613 would contain a linear subspace , then this would imply that @xmath614 for any choice of @xmath85 would be invariant with respect to the corresponding subtorus , and that contradicts the assumption that @xmath610 . 
 therefore in fact @xmath613 must be strictly convex , and @xmath614 by corollary [ indmor ] defines a morphism on @xmath615 . 
 hence we can extend @xmath614 to a morphism @xmath616 as desired . 
 this proves the induction claims ( i ) and ( ii ) . 
 it remains to show that the morphism @xmath617 corresponding to the last step of the loop , factors through the quotient variety @xmath123 . 
 as we have just seen , in our special case the cones in @xmath543 are strictly convex . 
 therefore @xmath543 is in fact the set of maximal cones of the quotient fan @xmath124 . 
 the toric prevariety @xmath618 is obtained from the affine charts @xmath619 , where @xmath620 , by glueing them along the open orbit @xmath5 . 
 the morphism @xmath617 induces morphisms @xmath621 that coincide on the open dense orbit @xmath5 . 
 we can also view the @xmath619 as affine charts of @xmath123 . 
 but in this variety for any pair @xmath622 , the charts @xmath619 and @xmath623 are glued along the common subset @xmath624 . since @xmath84 is separated , and the morphisms @xmath625 and @xmath626 agree on the open dense orbit , they even agree on @xmath624 . 
 so they fit together to a morphism @xmath627 and @xmath628 , where @xmath629 is the toric morphism induced by the identity on @xmath94 . 
 this ends the proof . 
 we also obtain as a corollary the following statement about actions of subtori of small codimension that was proved in @xcite as theorem 4.1 . 
 [ codim2pre ] let @xmath630 be a subtorus of codimension @xmath631 . 
 then for any separated toric quotient of a toric prevariety with big torus @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 the universal property  ( ca ) holds . 
 proof of proposition [ codim2pre ] . 
 let @xmath2 denote the separated toric quotient of a toric prevariety @xmath1 by @xmath4 . 
 if @xmath632 , then the conditions of theorem [ weakly proper toric quotient ] are automatically satisfied for @xmath3 , and therefore the universal property  ( ca ) holds . 
 let us now assume that @xmath633 . 
 then the projections of the maximal cones of @xmath124 in @xmath528 are at most @xmath6dimensional , and therefore the convex hull of two overlapping projections either equals their union or equals the whole plane @xmath634 . 
 so if the variety @xmath24 is @xmath6dimensional , then the algorithm for constructing the quotient fan shows that here @xmath3 also automatically satisfies the conditions of the theorem .    if @xmath635 , then among the cones of the given toric prevariety @xmath140 there must be a chain of cones @xmath636 such that @xmath637 , @xmath638 is strictly convex , and @xmath639 contains a one  dimensional linear subspace @xmath640 . 
 assume that @xmath641\in\omega(\s)$ ] and let @xmath642}$ ] denote the corresponding affine chart in @xmath1 . 
 let @xmath643 denote the open toric subprevariety of @xmath1 . 
 the toric morphism @xmath644 is weakly proper and hence ( ca ) holds for @xmath645 . 
 now let @xmath139 be an @xmath4invariant morphism . 
 then @xmath646 factors uniquely through @xmath645 , i.e.  there is a unique morphism @xmath647 such that @xmath648 on @xmath10 . 
 the toric quotient @xmath649 ( where @xmath650 ) is even an affine quotient and hence categorical . 
 so we similarly obtain a unique morphism @xmath651 such that @xmath652 on @xmath653 . 
 the morphisms @xmath654 and @xmath655 glue together to a morphism @xmath585 , where @xmath475 denotes the affine system of fans obtained from @xmath248 and @xmath656 as maximal cones by glueing them only along the zero cone . 
 we have @xmath657 , where @xmath658 denotes the natural toric morphism . 
 since @xmath659 , we can conclude from proposition [ kegelvergroesserung ] that @xmath660 or there exists a non  trivial linear subspace @xmath661 that is contained in the support of an @xmath587equivalence class . 
 since @xmath662 , in any case we have a one  dimensional linear subspace contained in the support of an @xmath587equivalence class . and @xmath587 is invariant with respect to the associated subtorus @xmath663 of the big torus @xmath91 of @xmath103 . 
 so @xmath85 is invariant with respect to @xmath664 . 
 that shows that in fact @xmath3 is the separated toric quotient of @xmath1 with respect to a torus of codimension at most @xmath19 , and we are back in the first case . 
 in this section we give an example of a @xmath14action on a @xmath13dimensional toric variety with @xmath665dimensional toric quotient space , such that the toric quotient @xmath2 is categorical , but not uniform in the sense of mumford , i.e. there is a saturated @xmath5stable open subset @xmath666 of @xmath1 such that the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath666 is not the categorical quotient of @xmath666 . 
 note that @xcite also contains an example of a categorical quotient that is not uniform . 
 but in that example the dimension of the quotient space is not maximal but strictly less than @xmath667 . 
 let @xmath668 be the @xmath13dimensional toric variety associated to the fan @xmath124 in @xmath669 with the following four maximal cones : @xmath670 let @xmath671 denote the linear map given by the matrix @xmath672 then following diagram shows the images of the maximal cones in @xmath673 . 
 note that @xmath674 in this case is a convex cone . 
 let @xmath24 denote the toric variety associated to the fan in @xmath673 with the two maximal cones @xmath675 and @xmath676 . the lattice homomorphism @xmath199 defines a toric morphism @xmath2 , and in fact @xmath3 is the toric quotient of @xmath1 by the action of the one  dimensional subtorus @xmath4 corresponding to the kernel of @xmath199 , which is generated by @xmath677 in @xmath678 . 
 since @xmath3 is weakly proper and @xmath679 , the toric quotient in this case is even categorical . 
 however the quotient does not satisfy the base 
 change property . 
 consider the open subset @xmath680 of @xmath1 consisting of the two affine charts corresponding to the cones @xmath681 and @xmath682 . 
 this subset is saturated , and the image under @xmath3 is the affine toric subvariety of @xmath24 corresponding to the cone generated by @xmath683 in @xmath673 .    on the other hand , 
 the toric variety @xmath666 admits a good quotient , and its quotient space is @xmath684 . 
 so in particular , @xmath685 is not affine . 
 therefore the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath666 can not be the categorical quotient of @xmath666 by @xmath4 .

82,"double barred ( s2b ) galaxies were first described over thirty years ago @xcite . 
 the _ hubble space telescope _ has revealed secondary bars at the center of at least one quarter of early - type optically - barred galaxies @xcite . 
 dynamically decoupled , where ( ) is the pattern speed of the secondary ( primary ) bar . ] 
 secondary bars in s2b galaxies have been hypothesized to be a mechanism for driving gas past the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) of primary bars , to feed the supermassive black holes that power active galactic nuclei @xcite . 
 the dynamics of secondary bars are still not well understood . 
 the random apparent relative orientations of primary and secondary bars in nearly face - on galaxies points to dynamical decoupling @xcite . but images alone can not reveal much about how the two bars rotate through each other . 
 kinematic evidence of decoupling , using either gas or stars , is harder to obtain @xcite . 
 indirect evidence for decoupling was claimed by @xcite based on rotation velocity peaks inside the secondary bars . 
 conclusive direct kinematic evidence for a decoupled secondary bar was obtained for ngc 2950 by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cda03 ) who showed , using the method of @xcite , that the primary and secondary bars can not be rotating at the same pattern speed . 
 simulations offer the best way to understand double barred systems . 
 however , the decoupled nuclear bars that formed in early simulations did not last long . 
 for example , the most long - lived nuclear bar in @xcite lasted for less than two turns of the primary bar , corresponding to about 0.4 gyr , which is far too short to explain the observed abundance of nested bars . 
 furthermore , their models usually require substantial amounts of gas to form and maintain these nuclear bars . 
 @xcite reported that nested bars form in a quasi - cosmological setting , but the amplitudes of the bars also seem to weaken rapidly after most of gas has formed stars ( * ? ? ? * figure  2 ) . 
 @xcite found that 4 out of 10 double - barred galaxies contain very little molecular gas in the nuclear region . 
 these clues suggest that large amounts of molecular gas may not be necessary to maintain central nuclear bars . 
 @xcite reported that a secondary bar forms in a collisionless @xmath0-body simulation , although their secondary bar had a `` vaguely spiral shape . ''    on the side of orbital studies , @xcite discovered a family of loop orbits that may form building blocks of long - lived nuclear stellar bars ( also @xcite ) . 
 their studies are very important for the understanding of double barred galaxies , but their models are not fully self - consistent , since nested bars in general can not rotate rigidly through each other @xcite . 
 so fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations are still needed to check if their main results still hold when the non - rigid nature of the bars is taken into account . 
 recently ( * ? ? ? 
 * hereafter ds07 ) demonstrated that long - lived secondary bars can form in purely collisionless @xmath0-body simulations , when a rotating pseudobulge is introduced in their model . 
 the nuclear bars in their work are distinctly bars , and do not have a spiral shape . 
 they showed that the behavior of their models were in good agreement with the loop orbit predictions of @xcite .    in this report 
 we analyze the photometrical and kinematical properties of high resolution models in detail . our theoretical results here 
 can also be compared to the observed 2-d kinematics of some double - barred galaxies , to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the secondary bars . 
 the simulations presented in this paper are all collisionless . 
 the model setup is very similar to that of ds07 . as in ds07 
 , the formation of the secondary bar is induced by a rotating pseudobulge . 
 we focus on three simulations : run d which formed a long - lasting double - barred system due to an initially rotating bulge , run s in which only a single bar formed with an initially unrotating bulge component , and run nb where there is no bulge component initially . 
 our high - resolution simulations consist of live disk and bulge components in a rigid halo potential . 
 we restrict ourselves to rigid halos to allow higher mass resolution in the nuclear regions , to study the complicated co - evolution of the two bars without the additional evolution introduced by the halo . 
 the rigid halos used in this study are all logarithmic potentials @xmath1 . 
 we set @xmath2 and @xmath3 in all runs . 
 we employed about four times more particles than the runs published in ds07 to better analyze the photometric and kinematic properties ; run d and s have @xmath4 equal mass particles , with @xmath5 in the disk and the rest in the bulge . 
 run nb has @xmath5 in the disk only since there is no bulge . 
 the initial disks in our simulations all have exponential surface densities with scale - length @xmath6 , mass @xmath7 and toomre-@xmath8 . 
 the bulge was generated using the method of @xcite as described in @xcite , where a distribution function is integrated iteratively in the global potential , until convergence . in both 
 run d and run s the bulge has mass @xmath9 and we used an isotropic king model distribution function . 
 the bulge truncation radius is @xmath10 in both run d and run s. the bulge set up this way is non - rotating . 
 we introduce bulge rotation in run d by simply reversing the velocities of bulge particles with negative angular momenta , which is still a valid solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite . the bulges in run d and 
 run s are flattened by the disk potential initially , and remain so at later times . 
 the initial kinematic ratio @xmath11 in run d is slightly above the line for oblate isotropic rotators @xcite . 
 we use @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the units of length and mass , respectively , and the time unit is @xmath12 . if we scale these units to the physical values @xmath13 and @xmath14 kpc , then a unit of time is @xmath15 myr . 
 we use a force resolution ( softening ) of @xmath16 , which scaled to the above physical units corresponds to 25 pc . 
 these simulations were evolved with a 3-d cylindrical polar grid code @xcite . 
 this code expands the potential in a fourier series in the cylindrical polar angle @xmath17 ; we truncated the expansion at @xmath18 . 
 forces in the radial direction are solved for by direct convolution with the greens function while the vertical forces are obtained by fast fourier transform . 
 we used grids measuring @xmath19 . 
 the vertical spacing of the grid planes was @xmath20 . 
 time integration used a leapfrog integrator with a fixed time step @xmath21 . 
 figure  [ fig:3dshape ] shows the surface density contours and images of the double - barred run d , run s , and run nb which does not have an initial bulge component . from figure  [ fig:3dshape ] 
 we see that for run d the secondary bar shows up in both the disk and bulge components . 
 all three large scale bars appear qualitatively similar to each other in both the face - on and edge - on views . 
 when viewed side - on , the large scale bar appears to be boxy / peanut - shaped regardless of whether or not an initial live bulge is included , or if a secondary bar is present . 
 the formation of a boxy / peanut - shaped bulge from disk has been studied extensively with @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 figure  [ fig:3dshape ] does not show any obvious influence of the secondary bar on the overall boxy / peanut - shaped side - on appearance of a large - scale bar . 
 so it is quite unlikely that most boxy - shaped bulges are edge - on nuclear bars , as speculated by @xcite as a possibility of explaining boxy bulges . 
 this is hardly surprising as the small size of the secondary bar makes its side - on signatures , if any , easily masked by the primary . 
 a caveat may be that the boxiness in figure  [ fig:3dshape ] does not cover a range as wide as that in @xcite . 
 also note that the boxy part is smaller than the primary bar ( regardless of double - barred or single - barred ) as a whole ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 figure  [ fig : n2950mod ] shows the projected system ( at @xmath22 when the two bars are nearly perpendicular ) with an ordinary orientation : the system is inclined at @xmath23 with the line of nodes ( lon ) of @xmath24 relative to the secondary bar major axis . the surface density image and contours 
 resemble many observed double - barred systems , such as ngc 2950 , even though we did not deliberately set out to match it .    2 fourier amplitude and phase of all particles for run d at @xmath25 . ]    . ] 
 figure  [ fig : m_2 ] shows radial variations of @xmath26 fourier amplitude and phase for run d at @xmath25 . 
 figure  [ fig : iraf ] shows the ellipticity and position angle ( pa ) profiles of ellipses fitted with iraf for the same data as in figure  [ fig : m_2 ] ( we use log scale for radius to be consistent with what observers usually adopt ) . 
 there are four popular methods for determining the semi - major axis @xmath27 of a bar . as summarized by @xcite and @xcite . for convenience , 
 we denote the primary bar as b1 and the secondary bar as b2 . 
 \(1 ) the bar end is measured by extrapolating half - way down the slope on the @xmath26 amplitude plot ( fig  [ fig : m_2]a ) . 
 we find @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the b2/b1 bar length ratio is about @xmath30 . 
 \(2 ) the bar end is measured when @xmath26 phase deviates from a constant by @xmath31 ( fig  [ fig : m_2]b ) . 
 we find @xmath32 , @xmath29 , the b2/b1 bar length ratio is about @xmath33 . 
 \(3 ) the bar end is measured at the peak of the fitted ellipticity profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , which is shown in fig  [ fig : iraf]a . 
 we find @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the b2/b1 bar length ratio is about @xmath36 . 
 \(4 ) the bar end is measured when the pa of fitted ellipses deviates from a constant by @xmath31 . 
 ( fig  [ fig : iraf]b ) . 
 we find @xmath37 , @xmath29 , the b2/b1 bar length ratio is about @xmath30 . 
 method 1 , 2 and 4 yield consistent values of the bar lengths and length ratios . 
 we found that method 3 tends to give a lower value of bar lengths than the other three methods , as shown in @xcite . 
 although these methods have some uncertainties in measuring the bar lengths , the length ratio of the two bars is in the range of 0.12 to 0.19 ( in particular method 1 , 2 , and 4 give a consistent narrow range of 0.17 to 0.19 ) . 
 this result is in good agreement with the typical observed length ratio of local s2b systems ( median ratio @xmath38 0.12 , see @xcite ) . 
 note that we expect that the length of the secondary can not be too large , otherwise the gravitational torque from the primary bar will inevitably twist the secondary into alignment if they rotate at different pattern speeds . 
 figure  [ fig : sd ] shows the face - on surface density profiles along the major and minor axis of the primary bar in run d , s , and nb . compared with the initial profile of each run 
 , there is a significant increase in central density following the formation of the large scale bar which redistributes the disk particles . for run 
 d , the central density profile along the primary bar major axis is no longer higher than that along the minor axis , due to the secondary bar orienting to a different direction from the primary bar . 
 this minor axis over - density is , of course , even more pronounced when the two bars are perpendicular . 
 this can be an important signature of confirming small secondary bars photometrically , especially when the central region is not well resolved . 
 variations in m / l are unlikely to mask this minor / major axis difference as density profiles are for roughly the same radial range . on the other hand 
 , long wavelength photometry is preferred to minimize the effects of dust . 
 we do not find other significant differences in the face - on surface density profiles between run d and other runs without a secondary bar . 
 figure  [ fig : spct ] shows the behavior of the azimuthally averaged @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the location of the lindblad resonances of the bars at around @xmath25 for run d. as shown in ds07 , the pattern speeds of the bars , especially that of the secondary , vary as they rotate through each other : the secondary bar rotates slower than average when the two bars are perpendicular , and faster when the bars are parallel . 
 the patten speed bands shown in figure  [ fig : spct ] reflect such variations . 
 clearly the pattern speed of the secondary bar oscillates much more than that of the primary . 
 the primary bar extends roughly to its cr radius ( @xmath41 ) , consistent with the general expectation and is therefore considered a fast bar ( e.g. cda03 , * ? ? ? 
 the secondary bar rotates faster than the primary bar . 
 however , the secondary bar is much shorter than its shortest @xmath42 . 
 in addition , even if the variation of the pattern speed is taken into account , the @xmath42 of the secondary is not very close to the @xmath43 of the primary , if we use the same naive definition of @xmath43 as in @xcite read naively from figure  [ fig : spct ] serves just as a visual guide , because the @xmath43 determined this way is reliable only for weak bars , which is questionable for our strong bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ] . 
 this is inconsistent with the speculated cr - ilr coupling requirement for making secondary bars ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 since the long - lasting secondary bars which form in our simulations generally do not extend to their corotation radii , the kinematics of secondary bars differ from those of primary bars in at least this important detail . 
 we here explore the kinematic observables of s2bs in our simulations in more detail . 
 we analyzed the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) by measuring the mean velocity @xmath44 and velocity dispersion @xmath45 . 
 departures from a gaussian distribution are parameterized by gauss - hermite moments @xcite . 
 the second order term in such an expansion is related to the dispersion . 
 following @xcite the third - order term @xmath46 and fourth - order term @xmath47 are defined as    @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 , @xmath52(8w^3 - 12w)$ ] , and @xmath53(16w^4 - 48w^2 + 12)$ ] . for a particle model , 
 the integral becomes a sum and @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath55 , the number of particles in a bin . 
 @xmath46 measures deviations that are asymmetric about the mean , while @xmath47 measures the lowest order symmetric deviations from gaussian ( negative for a `` flat - top '' distribution , and positive for a more peaked one ) . 
 figure  [ fig : kinemap](a - e ) show the images and the los stellar kinematics of run d at @xmath22 when the two bars are almost perpendicular to each other . for comparison purpose figure 
 [ fig : kinemap](f ) is for run nb ( run s is very similar to run nb , so it is not shown for brevity ) . as in figure 
 [ fig : n2950mod ] , we project the system to @xmath56 with the lon of @xmath57 relative to the secondary bar major axis . 
 the most striking feature in figure  [ fig : kinemap ] is that the twist of the kinematic minor axis ( i.e. @xmath58 ) in the secondary bar region is weak ( see the mean velocity maps ) . 
 the kinematic minor axis is almost perpendicular to the inclination axis , although there is a small but noticeable twisted pinch near the kinematic minor axis in the nuclear region . 
 the weak central twist is mainly due to the relatively large velocity dispersion , especially in the central region ( likewise at @xmath59 when only the small nuclear bar exists , the stellar twist is slightly stronger than at @xmath22 , but still quite small compared to the expected twist in gaseous kinematics ) . on the other hand , 
 the twist of the kinematic _ major _ axis is more prominent in the central region . 
 @xcite found the stellar kinematic minor axis hardly twists from the pa of the disk in their sample with the most reliable kinematics , leading them to question whether nuclear photometric isophotal twists represent _ bona fide _ dynamically decoupled secondary bars . 
 we demonstrate that an authentic decoupled secondary bar may indeed produce a very weak twist of the kinematic minor axis in the stellar velocity field . 
 so a central stellar velocity map without a strong twist as in @xcite does not necessarily exclude the existence of a decoupled nuclear bar .    as a comparison , 
 figure  [ fig : kinemap](f ) shows that the kinematical minor axis twist is just slightly stronger for the single - barred run nb . 
 of course gas kinematics may show much more twisted features than the stellar data ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) . however , the gas in the nuclear region is more prone to non - gravitational forces like shocks , agn jets and outflows , so may not directly probe the underlying gravitational potential . 
 it is also worth noting that the @xmath45 symmetry axis does not align with the secondary or the primary bar ( also true for the single bar run nb ) , which is consistent with what @xcite found . we do not find a clear signature in the @xmath46 map associated with secondary and primary bar . 
 the ring in the @xmath47 map of figure  [ fig : kinemap](c ) is not always present for different projections , so it can not be used to detect secondary bars . 
 figure  [ fig : slits ] shows various slit profiles along the major / minor axis of the primary / secondary bar of run d at @xmath22 , and for run s. we notice that there is no central velocity dispersion ( @xmath45 ) drop in our simulated double - barred systems . 
 so the @xmath45-drop ( as found in @xcite ) is not a requirement , and is not always associated with the formation of a double - barred system . 
 more likely @xmath45-drops are just the signature of newly - formed ( therefore dynamically `` cool '' ) stars @xcite . 
 @xmath0-body simulations have shown that a @xmath45-drop can be produced in single barred galaxies @xcite , so it is not necessarily a unique feature of double - barred systems .    in figure 
 [ fig : slits](a ) there is a second reversal of @xmath46 on the major axis of the primary bar in the nuclear region ( @xmath60 ) . 
 such a @xmath46 feature is never found for a single bar case ( run s ) at any orientation . 
 it manifests the complex asymmetric los velocity distribution in the nuclear region , and is an indication of the decoupled secondary bar . 
 however , the reverse argument is invalid : we found that such @xmath46 features are not visible at all orientations . 
 although our secondary bar is clearly decoupled from the primary bar , the maximum of the rotational velocity does not occur in the nuclear region ( figure  [ fig : slits ] ) , instead the rotational velocity just rises smoothly past the region of the secondary bar ( the half - length of the secondary bar is around 0.4 , see  [ sec : barlength ] ) . 
 this is different from @xcite , possibly indicating the location of the maximum of the rotational velocity is not a crucial factor for maintaining a nuclear bar . 
 the dynamical state and evolution of barred galaxies is determined by the pattern speed of their bars . 
 knowledge of the pattern speeds of secondary bars may constrain mechanisms of their formation and evolution . 
 not much is yet known with certainty about secondary bar pattern speeds . 
 observationally , the only direct kinematic constraint on , based on the tremaine - weinberg @xcite method , was obtained for ngc 2950 by cda03 , who showed that the primary and nuclear bars can not be rotating at the same rate . 
 they further suggested that the nuclear bar of ngc 2950 is either rotating faster or counter - rotating with respect to the primary bar . 
 * hereafter m06 ) , more emphatically , argued that ngc 2950 _ has _ to be counter - rotating with respect to the primary . 
 this would raise the prospect that either ngc 2950 is atypical or that counter - rotating ( or possibly librating ) double bars are common . 
 however , this conclusion is based on the assumption that the tremaine - weinberg ( tw ) method continues to hold for nested bars , which cda03 suggested may not be the case . 
 our simulations provide an ideal testbed for assessing the reliability of measurements of . here 
 we test whether the simple version of the tw method as used by cda03 using 3 slits can recover accurately and check whether the signature of apparent counter - rotation can occur without actual counter - rotation . 
 the tw method requires that the continuity equation is satisfied for some kinematic tracer and that the tracer s density can be written as @xmath61 . for slits parallel to the major axis of the disk , if is the luminosity - weighted mean velocity along any such slit , and the luminosity - weighted mean position along the same slit , then plotting versus results in a straight line with a slope of @xmath62 . 
 this tw method has been used to measure pattern speeds in large - scale bars @xcite . 
 cda03 showed that slits passing through the secondary bar did not lie on the same line as those passing through only the primary bar , proving that @xmath63 . 
 cda03 argued that while  can be measured from the region outside the secondary bar , can not be obtained as easily . 
 their reasons for this were two - fold : ( 1 ) disentangling the contribution to  and  from the primary and secondary bars is non - trivial and ( 2 ) the secondary bar can not be in rigid rotation @xcite , violating the assumption of the tw method that the density can be expressed as @xmath61 . 
 disentangling the different contributions to integrals may be possible : cda03 presented two models for doing this and m06 presented another . 
 m06 also estimated the effect of non - rigid rotation to be less than 15% ; this estimate was however based on the simplifying assumption that the system is 2-d . 
 we therefore explore the effect of non - rigid rotation on measurements of directly with the simulations . 
 the novelty of our approach lies in our ability to cleanly disentangle the primary and secondary bars : in our simulations we distinguish between disk and bulge particles . 
 while the disk particles support both the secondary and primary bars , the bulge particles almost exclusively support only the secondary bar . thus if we consider only bulge particles we have a quite clean tracer population for the nuclear bar . 
 it is very unlikely that any scheme that can be devised for observational data will ever be able to separate the secondary bar from the primary as cleanly as we can in our simulations . 
 we therefore apply the tw - method to bulge particles only . 
 we used 11 slits covering the full region @xmath64 , with @xmath65 where the nuclear bar is strongest . 
 this corresponds to slit - widths @xmath66 or @xmath67 ( in comparison , the observations of cda03 had @xmath68 ) . 
 we adopted an inclination @xmath23 and varied the nuclear bar pa relative to the inclination axis , , in the range @xmath69  @xmath70 . 
 we measured and for each slit as in ( * ? ? ? 
 * hereafter d03 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the line - of - sight velocity and @xmath74 coordinate of particle @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the number of bulge particles in the slit . 
 the sums in these definitions are over bulge particles only .    to measure we fit a straight line to as a function of using least - squares . 
 as in d03 , we estimate errors on the slit integrals ,  and , by their radial variation outside @xmath77 . 
 we also experimented with a number of other error estimates including equal errors , the difference between positive and negative @xmath78 and errors proportional to @xmath76 . 
 we found that the most accurate measurements were obtained assuming weights @xmath79 , which we adopt throughout . in observations the main uncertainties are in  and linear regression 
 is dominated by , as here . 
 we denote the slope of the fitted line as @xmath80 in order to distinguish  from the pattern speed , , measured through the time evolution of the simulation . 
 we quantify the typical errors in  as @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents an average over the range @xmath83 , which are favorable orientations because they give large values of . 
 we start by considering the precision with which can be measured in the absence of a primary bar by considering run d at @xmath59 , before the primary bar forms but after the nuclear bar has saturated . 
 figure [ fig : sys1081_020 ] presents the surface density of the system ; only a nuclear bar is present which is well traced by the bulge particles . 
 the right panel shows the projected surface density at @xmath23 and @xmath84 with the slits used superposed . 
 the value of measured from the time evolution is listed in table [ tab : twmeasurements ] . in figure 
 [ fig : tw1081_020 ] we present the tw measurement for the same orientation . 
 the measured  is accurate to better than 10% , which is the typical uncertainty for single bars ( d03 , * ? ? ? 
 the integrals  and  are both well - behaved and each pair of slits at @xmath85 are consistent with a single straight line that matches the pattern speed very well . figure [ fig : avgtwerr1081.t20 ] summarizes the reliability of tw measurements for a single nuclear bar , which shows that can be measured to better than @xmath86 for all reasonable orientations . 
 we also experimented with a three slit configuration consisting of the central @xmath87 slit and @xmath88 for each @xmath89 and found  increases but is still @xmath90 . 
 thus the tw method is well - behaved for an isolated nuclear bar .    . 
 right : the bulge viewed at @xmath23 and @xmath91 with the slits used in the tw measurement indicated by the dashed lines . 
 [ fig : sys1081_020 ] ]    in figure [ fig : s2bconts ] we show the bulge of run d at @xmath92 ; the nuclear bar is prominent , and has insignificant or no elongation along the primary bar . thus using bulge particles only for 
 tw measurements will result in only the nuclear bar being included .

 the line indicates the orientation of the primary bar at the given time . 
 [ fig : s2bconts],title=""fig : "" ]    in figure [ fig : tw4545 ] we present a single tw measurement at @xmath95 and @xmath84 for each of the 4 times of figure [ fig : s2bconts ] . while the integrals themselves appear generally well - behaved , the scatter of the points about the fitted lines is larger than at @xmath59 . 
 this scatter leads to a larger  than in the single bar case for all orientations of the secondary bar , as shown in figure [ fig : fulls2btw ] and summarized in table [ tab : twmeasurements ] . 
 other than being large at the smallest values of @xmath96 ,  does not correlate with @xmath96 or @xmath97 . 
 when we fit lines to three slits as before , we find that the quality of the fits varies considerably ( figure [ fig : sliterrs ] ) . we conclude that observationally it is difficult to determine the uncertainty in any measurement of based on slit data obtained by cda03 for ngc 2950 . 
 .the results of tw measurements . 
 the column @xmath98 gives the approximate angle between the two bars . [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ]      we have demonstrated that the standard tw method on the secondary bar , while not wholly unreliable , is unable to recover without significant uncertainty . 
 observationally this situation would be exacerbated by the need to subtract the contribution of the primary bar from the measured integrals , which we have not addressed ( but see * ? ? ? 
 the amplitude of the @xmath26 perturbation in bulge particles varies by some @xmath99 about the mean amplitude at all radii . 
 is the failure of the tw method for secondary bars consistent with the idea that non - rigid rotation leads to large errors ? 
 evidence that this is indeed the case can be found in figure [ fig : fulls2btw ] , which shows that the largest errors occur for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . 
 figure 2 of @xcite shows that the amplitude of the secondary bar , @xmath102 . 
 thus @xmath103 peaks at @xmath104 , which is in excellent agreement with the phases where we find the largest errors . 
 moreover , the redistribution of material being radial along the secondary bar , we expect that the largest errors will occur when the radial motions contribute more to the line - of - sight velocity . while some of the error at all times in figure [ fig : fulls2btw ] is clearly due to noise , a significant part is also physical . 
 most importantly , we find that , for @xmath104 , the larger @xmath105 is , the larger is the error in . 
 this leads us to conclude that , as argued by cda03 , the perturbations to the tw method due to non - rigid rotation are sufficiently large as to render simple measurements of @xmath106 noisy at best . 
 we have focused here on using slits to compare with the observations of cda03 and used only bulge particles to isolate the nuclear bar . 
 @xcite present an analysis using an extension of the tw method which is able to disentangle multiple pattern speeds provided full 2-d velocity fields . 
 they find , as here , that the pattern speed of the secondary is prone to larger uncertainties . 
 however , regularization with that method leads to more accurate measurements of . 
 although we have shown that the tw method as used by cda03 is not very accurate for secondary bars , it is not so grossly unreliable that we can not consider the question of whether the secondary bar in ngc 2950 is counter - rotating . if it were , this would suggest a formation scenario for double - barred galaxies different from the one presented here . 
 simulations have found that counter - rotating nuclear bars are possible if counter - rotating material is present in the disk @xcite and this remains a viable model if such material is present in a sufficiently large fraction of galaxies . 
 starting from the assumption that both bars satisfy the continuity equation and are in rigid rotation ( _ i.e. _  @xmath107 for @xmath108 ) , cda03 showed that the tw method for the two bars combined becomes @xmath109 the observed quantities are and @xmath110 whereas the required quantities for determining the s are @xmath111 and @xmath112 . since slits can be selected to pass through the primary but not the secondary bar , it is possible to derive  assuming that the oscillations in the primary are small ( in good agreement with our simulations ) . 
 ignoring the effect of non - rigid rotation , cda03 considered two assumptions for in eqn . 
 [ eqn : s2btw ] to solve for in ngc 2950 . 
 this gave a range of possible values of , including a secondary bar counter - rotating relative to the primary bar . 
 using the same data , m06 made a different attempt at isolating the secondary bar . 
 based on his analysis , m06 also argued that the secondary bar in ngc 2950 is counter - rotating . since the analyses of both cda03 and m06 ignored the non - rigid rotation , neither of the estimates for is likely to be very accurate as we showed above . 
 nevertheless , we do not find in our simulations cases where the behavior of the integrals resembles that in ngc 2950 . 
 as emphasized by m06 , the main characteristic of the @xmath113 profile in ngc 2950 is that it becomes steeper without changing sign in the nuclear bar region ( see figure 3 of cda03 ) . 
 this happens despite the fact that the two bars are on opposite sides of the minor axis ( see figure [ fig : n2950mod ] ) , causing to have the opposite sign of and leading to @xmath96 declining more rapidly in the secondary bar region . 
 but instead of  also being shallower in this region , cda03 found that @xmath113 steepens there . 
 for tw measurements of the system in figure [ fig : n2950mod ] , a tw measurement using slits passing through both bars ( now with both disk and bulge particles included ) does not show a steeper @xmath113 profile ( see figure [ fig : xyv405wdisk ] ) . 
 we conclude that ngc 2950 may indeed have a counter - rotating primary and secondary bars . 
 another possibility might be that the nuclear bar librates about the primary bar , which deserves more investigation in future studies . 
 we have analyzed the photometrical and kinematical properties of our high resolution models , and contrasted them when with or without a secondary bar . 
 this study also compared the simulated secondary bars with observations . 
 in general the shape of secondary bars in our models is reasonable compared to observed ones . 
 the length ratio of two bars , determined by various methods , is in the range of 0.12 to 0.19 , in good agreement with @xcite . 
 we also found the overall edge - on shape of boxy bulges is largely unaffected by the existence of a secondary bar . at lower inclinations , 
 the central density profile along the primary bar major axis is lower than that along the minor axis , due to the secondary bar orienting to a different direction . 
 the primary extends roughly to its corotation radius , and therefore fits the definition of a fast bar ( see for example @xcite ) . 
 although the secondary bar rotates more rapidly than the primary , its semi - major axis is much shorter than its corotation radius , even if we take the oscillation of the bar patterns speeds into account . 
 we did not find evidence of cr - ilr coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) in our models . 
 we find that the central twist of kinematic axes is quite weak even if a secondary bar is present , due to the relatively large velocity dispersion of stars in the central region . 
 this is consistent with the 2-d stellar kinematics of secondary bars studied in @xcite . 
 there are no clear @xmath47 signatures associated with the presence of secondary bars . 
 a @xmath46 reversal feature may appear in the nuclear region at some favorable orientations . 
 we do not find a @xmath45 ( velocity dispersion ) drop for our secondary bar model . 
 it is more likely that @xmath45-drops are just the signature of newly - formed stars , and it is not necessarily a unique feature of double - barred systems . 
 we showed that the tremaine - weinberg method is not very reliable even when the primary bar contribution is fully excluded . 
 the way in which the measurement fails is consistent with the proposal of cda03 , namely that the non - rigid rotation leads to internal motions that violate the stationary frame assumption of the method . 
 nonetheless , we find no example in our simulations where the behavior of the tw integrals mimics that observed in ngc 2950 . 
 thus this galaxy may indeed have counter - rotating secondary and primary bars . 
 the general agreement between our simulations and observations of double barred galaxies gives us confidence that the simulations are capturing the same dynamics as in nature . 
 this is especially remarkable because secondary bars are not merely scaled down versions of primary bars , but have distinctly different kinematic properties . in the absence of self - consistent simulations 
 , earlier orbit - based models could not directly confront the challenge from observations which found such differences . 
 this demonstrates the advantage of finally being able to simulate stellar double - barred galaxies , which had been puzzling for so long .

83,"cold atoms in harmonic traps and optical lattices continue to be an important controllable system for investigations into various properties of condensed matter . 
 a case in point is the direct observation of anderson localization@xcite of matter waves by several experimental groups @xcite in recent years . that the anderson localization is a strongly dimension dependant phenomenon was recognized early on@xcite . 
 an infinitesimal random disorder localizes all the single particle states in two and lower dimensions@xcite ( see also the note in ref . 
 this also rules out the development of mobility edges in two and lower dimensions . 
 however , if the disorder distribution is deterministic , it is possible to have extended states if the quasi - disorder strength ( @xmath1 ) is below a critical value ( @xmath2 ) , as is found in the one - dimensional aubry - andr ( aa ) model@xcite . 
 recently , localization properties of non - interacting bosons loaded into a one - dimensional optical lattice with an aa quasi - disorder potential were experimentally investigated by the lens group@xcite . 
 detailed theoretical studies of the aa model have been carried out both in the past@xcite and in the recent times@xcite ( for recent reviews see refs . ) . in the aa model , where the hopping is restricted to between nearest neighbors ( nn ) , all the single particle states remain extended for @xmath1 below @xmath2 and become localized above it , which implies , again , the absence of mobility edges . following a line of research into the effects of longer range hopping on the localization properties@xcite , recently it was discovered that the hopping beyond the nn can lead to the development of mobility edges in what may be called extended aa models@xcite . 
 considering the fact that the aa model has already been realized in experiments and that the experimental investigations of various aspects of the localization phenomena using cold atoms is ongoing@xcite , further theoretical studies of the beyond - nn - effects on the localization and the bose condensation in extended aa models are certainly of current interest . 
 the purpose of this paper is to present some interesting results obtained in such an investigation .    in this paper 
 , we study the effects of the nnn hopping on some properties of bosons in optical lattices with aa quasi - disorder without and with confining harmonic potentials . in the first part of this paper , 
 we investigate the effects of @xmath0 on the localization properties of a single boson employing the exact diagonalization method . 
 we consider a single boson moving with nn and nnn hoppings in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice with aa quasi - disorder . 
 we will show that the sign of @xmath0 plays an important role on the localization . 
 the numerical results obtained are supplemented with analytical results for the energy dependence and the @xmath0 dependence of the critical disorder strength required for the localization transition . 
 we also compare some of the results obtained using periodic boundary conditions to those obtained employing open boundary conditions@xcite after including a harmonic potential , which is usually present in the experiments . in the second part of this paper , we consider a many boson system and study the effects of @xmath0 on the bose - einstein condensation . 
 the condensate fraction is found to show a significant dependence on @xmath0 and the quasi - disorder strength . 
 we also show that the phase of the aa potential has a significant effect on the condensate fraction . 
 since we are dealing with a quasi - disordered system , it is appropriate for us to place this work in the larger field of the studies on the effects of random disorder on bose - einstein condensates . 
 there have been extensive studies on the random disorder effects on interacting continuum bosons@xcite . 
 these investigations found that the condensate fraction decreases with increasing disorder strength . 
 further , recent studies on non - interacting lattice bosons@xcite reached the conclusion that the bose condensation temperature slightly enhances with disorder for large filling whereas it reduces for small filling . 
 extensive studies have also been conducted on interacting disordered lattice bosons employing the bose - hubbard model and its variants@xcite . on the experimental front 
 , it has been reported that the random disorder reduces the condensate fraction of lattice bosons in a harmonic trap@xcite . 
 the rest of this paper is organized as follows . 
 the numerical and the analytical studies on the single particle localization properties are presented in sec . 
 the studies on the effect of @xmath0 on the bose - einstein condensation and the effects of the different phases of the aa potential are presented in sec . 
 the conclusions are given in sec . 
 in the first part of this section we study a lattice boson in the aa disorder potential . 
 the hamiltonian of this system is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a site index in a one - dimensional optical lattice with a lattice constant @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are the nn and the nnn hopping matrix elements , @xmath7 is a creation operator for a boson at site @xmath4 , @xmath8 is the locator of a nn site , @xmath1 the strength of the aa potential , and @xmath9 = ( @xmath10 + 1)/2 is the incommensurability parameter . 
 here @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have energy units . 
 all the energies in this paper are measured in units of @xmath11 . 
 we note here that biddle _ et . al._@xcite 
 have shown that , for positive @xmath6 and @xmath0 , the @xmath2 decreases with @xmath0 for low energy states while it increases for high energy states . in our studies 
 we have considered both negative and positive @xmath0 values . in this paper , 
 the results presented for localization studies are for positive @xmath6 unless stated otherwise . 
 we numerically diagonalize @xmath12 to obtain its eigenenergies and eigenfunctions . 
 all our results presented in this paper are obtained considering a lattice of 233 sites . 
 we monitor the localization properties by calculating the shannon entropy which is a measure of the quantum entanglement@xcite . 
 the shannon entropy for the ground state is given by @xmath13 where , @xmath14 in which the @xmath15 is the @xmath4th site amplitude of the ground state wave - function @xmath16 we also supplement these results with calculations of the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) . 
 the ipr is defined by @xmath17    in fig . 1 , we have shown the variations of the s and the ipr of the ground state as a function of the quasi - disorder strength for various values of @xmath0 . 
 the transition from the extended to the localized state is signaled by a large drop in @xmath18 and a large rise in ipr . in the absence of the nnn 
 hopping , the transition occurs at a critical disorder strength @xmath19 . 
 it is seen that @xmath2 changes as @xmath0 is introduced and the sign of @xmath0 has a significant effect on the localization transition . 
 the @xmath2 for the ground state decreases with @xmath20 for @xmath21 and increases with @xmath20 for @xmath0 negative . in fig . 
 1 we have also presented the results for @xmath22 and @xmath23 . 
 we have seen that the results do not depend on the sign of @xmath6 @xcite . 
 next we have studied the energy dependence of the @xmath2 . 
 we generalize the definitions of s and ipr to excited states by replacing @xmath24 with corresponding excited state wave functions in eq . 
 we have numerically obtained the @xmath2 for all the 233 eigenstates from the calculations of the @xmath25 as well as the @xmath26 as a function of @xmath1 as shown in fig . 2 for three states . 
 for each eigenstate , the value of @xmath1 for which @xmath25 is minimum and @xmath26 is maximum is taken as the @xmath2 of that state and the corresponding eigenenergy is @xmath27 . 
 we note here that @xmath25 is a better indicator of the localization transition compared to @xmath26 . in fig . 
 3 , we have shown the variation of the @xmath2 with @xmath27 for @xmath0 = -0.1 . 
 the @xmath2 is seen to decrease approximately linearly with increasing energy . 
 it may be noted that for positive @xmath0 this trend is reverse@xcite . 
 the numerical results obtained for negative @xmath0 can be understood from an extension of the analytical calculations given in ref . . 
 we start with the following hamiltonian for an infinite system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the site indices and @xmath32= 0 or 1 . here , the hopping strength decreases exponentially with increasing distance and our choice ( eq . 
 7 ) makes @xmath6 positive whereas @xmath0 is positive or negative depending on @xmath33 or @xmath34 . 
 the relevance of this model in the context of ultracold atoms in optical lattices has been discussed in ref . . 
 the eigenvalue equation is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the amplitude of the wave function at site @xmath30 and @xmath37 the energy eigenvalue . 
 now defining @xmath38 which immediately gives @xmath39 with @xmath40 the eigenvalue equation becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 the dual to the preceding eigenvalue equation is obtained by multiplying both sides of it with @xmath43 and summing over @xmath44 , an integer . 
 the dual is obtained as @xmath45 where @xmath46 the eqs . 
 ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) become self dual for @xmath47 = @xmath48 . at the self dual point , following eq . 
 ( 9 ) , one gets @xmath49 noting that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one obtains from the preceding equation an equation for @xmath2 as @xmath52 when @xmath0 = @xmath53 , the critical disorder strength @xmath2 is energy independent and is equal to @xmath54 , a result obtained for the original aa model . when @xmath55 @xmath53 and energy ( @xmath37 ) is fixed , the change in @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath0 provided @xmath56 is small . for a fixed value of @xmath0 , 
 @xmath2 increases or decreases linearly with the energy eigenvalue @xmath37 depending on @xmath0 being positive or negative . in fig . 
 3 , the solid line is obtained by using eq . 
 ( 17 ) for @xmath56= -0.1 . 
 the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with the analytical results . 
 note that the numerical results are obtained considering nn and nnn hoppings only while the analytical results are derived considering long range hopping which decays exponentially with distance . in fig . 
 4 , we plot the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath2 for the ground state . we find that an increase in @xmath20 for negative @xmath0 increases the @xmath2 while increasing positive @xmath0 reduces @xmath2 and that it decreases almost linearly with increasing @xmath0 .    from now on , keeping the cold atom experiments in mind , we consider the effects of a harmonic confining potential . 
 the hamiltonian of the system is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 , which has an energy unit , is the strength of the harmonic confining potential . in the presence of harmonic potential 
 , we use open boundary conditions and measure the position coordinate of a lattice site from the center of the harmonic trap . in such cases the effect of the second nearest - neighbor hopping on the entanglement is shown in fig . 
 5 . in this figure 
 one finds a small region of @xmath1 where the entanglement ( @xmath18 ) increases with @xmath1 , in contrast to the usual behavior of suppression of @xmath18 with increasing @xmath1 . 
 then @xmath18 reaches a peak and falls abruptly with increasing @xmath1 signifying localization of the wave function . 
 the small enhancement of @xmath18 preceding the localization transition results from a competition between the aa potential trying to move the boson away from the center of the trap and the confining potential trying to bring it to the center of the trap , as explained in our earlier paper ( ref . ) . 
 we note here that the disorder induced enhancement of @xmath18 becomes prominent and the peak becomes sharper with increasing positive @xmath0 , whereas the peak becomes broader for negative values of @xmath0 . in fig . 
 6 we have plotted the @xmath2 for the ground state as a function of @xmath0 for different values of the strength ( @xmath58 ) of the harmonic potential . 
 @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath0 and the curves are almost linear as similar to that for a closed chain . for a fixed @xmath0 
 the @xmath2 increases with increasing @xmath58 . 
 the physical origin of this effect is in the harmonic potential opposing the disorder trying to localize the boson away from the trap center . 
 vs e for @xmath0 = -0.1 . 
 the plus signs represent numerically determined @xmath2 and energy eigenvalues for different eigenstates for a closed chain of 233 lattice sites and the solid line is the approximate analytical result .

 the aa potential is placed symmetrically about the center of the harmonic trap with phase factor @xmath59 = 0 ( see eq . 
 the solid circles represent the results for @xmath6 = -1.0 and @xmath0 = 0.05.,width=384 ]     with @xmath0 for an open chain of 233 lattice sites in harmonic traps : @xmath58 = 0 ( squares ) , @xmath58 = 0.00001 ( diamonds ) , and @xmath58 = 0.00005 ( circles ) . 
 the aa potential is placed symmetrically about the center of the harmonic trap with phase factor @xmath59 = 0.,width=384 ] 
 in this section we first study the effect of @xmath0 on the bose condensate fraction of a collection of bosons in a finite one - dimensional periodic optical lattice with aa disorder in a harmonic confining potential . 
 the system hamiltonian is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the chemical potential . in terms of the single particle energy levels 
 ( @xmath62)obtained by numerically diagonalizing the hamiltonian given in eq . ( 18 ) , the boson number equation is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the lowest and the highest energy levels , and @xmath66 in which @xmath67 with @xmath68 the boltzmann constant and @xmath69 the temperature . 
 we first determine the chemical potential and then the boson populations in various energy levels using the boson number equation . 
 the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction for various values of the quasi - disorder strength for fixed @xmath0 values are shown in fig . 
 7 . in the low temperature regime , increasing @xmath1 is seen to suppress the condensate fraction . beyond this temperature range , 
 increasing @xmath1 leads to a reduction of the @xmath70 until @xmath1 = @xmath2 and then to an enhancement for @xmath71 . 
 the effect of @xmath0 on the condensate fraction for fixed value of the quasi - disorder strength is shown in fig . 
 it is clear that a negative @xmath0 enhances the @xmath70 while a positive @xmath0 reduces it . 
 it is also seen that the effect of a positive @xmath0 is more prominent in comparison with a negative @xmath0 .    ) with temperature for 10000 bosons in an open chain with 233 sites in a harmonic trap with @xmath58 = 0.00001 for different strengths of the aa potential and different values of @xmath0 .

 the aa potential is placed symmetrically about the center of the harmonic trap with phase factor @xmath59 = 0 . 
 , width=384 ]    all the results presented in the presence of the harmonic trap are obtained by placing the aa potential symmetric about the center of the trap . to study the effects of varying the phase factor of the aa potential on the condensate fraction 
 , we consider the potential at a site @xmath4 with a phase factor @xmath59 as @xmath72,\ ] ] where the coordinate of the site @xmath4 is measured from the center of the trap . for @xmath73 
 the potential is symmetric about the center and has its highest value there . 
 this is a unique situation where the aa potential and the harmonic trap compete with each other in the localization transition regime as mentioned previously . in the top panel of fig . 
 9 , we have compared the @xmath1 dependence of the low temperature @xmath70 for @xmath59 = 0 with two finite values of @xmath59 . 
 the phase factor is found to have a strong influence . 
 the drop in the condensate fraction to 0.5 in the localization transition region occurs only for @xmath59 = 0 . to understand the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath70 
 , we looked at the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state ( @xmath74 ) , as shown in the lower panel of the fig . 
 the physical origin of the variations seen is in the disorder induced changes in the lower energy levels of the boson . for @xmath59 = 0 , 
 the drop to 0.5 occurs because the ground state and the first excited state are equally populated since @xmath74 is extremely small for @xmath1 > @xmath2 . for non zero values of @xmath59 
 , the @xmath74 shows a minimum at @xmath2 , and then it becomes large enough so that almost all the bosons are in the ground state for all @xmath1 except at @xmath2 where @xmath70 shows a dip . in the upper panel of fig . 
 10 , we have shown the dependences of @xmath70 in the entire of range ( @xmath53 to @xmath75 ) of @xmath59 for two temperatures for a fixed aa disorder strength . 
 the changes in @xmath70 increases with increasing temperature . 
 the variation of @xmath70 closely tracks the changes in @xmath74 given in the lower panel of the fig . 
 in this paper we investigated the effects of next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping ( @xmath0 ) on the properties of non - interacting bosons in optical lattices in the presence of an aubry - andr quasi - disorder . in closed chains , for the ground state 
 , a negative @xmath0 enhances the critical disorder strength ( @xmath2 ) for the ground state required for the localization transition while a positive @xmath0 reduces it . for high energy states ( @xmath76 ) , 
 the trend is opposite . 
 these results obtained numerically were complemented with analytical calculations . 
 we further extended these studies of the single particle localization including the effects of a harmonic confining potential with open boundary conditions which usually obtains in cold atom experiments . 
 the harmonic potential was found to increase the @xmath2 . 
 it was also found that while negative @xmath0 enhances the entanglement ( s ) , the effect of a positive @xmath0 is to reduce it . 
 further , a positive @xmath0 enhances the disorder induced enhancement of the @xmath18 when the harmonic trap competes with the aa potential in the localization transition region . 
 next we considered a many boson system and studied the effects of @xmath0 on the bose condensation . 
 it is found that the thermal depletion of the condensate is enhanced by a negative @xmath0 while it is reduced for a positive @xmath0 . finally , we investigated the effects of the phase of the aa potential on the condensate fraction ( @xmath70 ) to find that it has a very strong effect on the @xmath70 for @xmath77 .

84,"in relatively few extragalactic radio jets can the kinematics of the flow on kpc scales be studied with any degree of certainty . 
 most arguments are indirect , relying either on beaming statistics for samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) or , for powerful jets oriented along the line of sight , on models relying on an assumed inverse - compton origin for the x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 for the few low - power radio galaxies with heavily studied , straight , radio jets and counterjets , kinematic models have been constructed based on the jet - counterjet asymmetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 these models have supported jet deceleration through mass entrainment , and ongoing work has already shown consistency between the density and pressure model inferred from the jet and the properties of the external x - ray - emitting gas for 3c31 @xcite .    in models of mass entrainment , 
 the outer parts ( `` sheath '' ) are decelerated before the inner ( `` spine '' ) , consistent with a range of observational evidence at radio frequencies @xcite . 
 applied to more central regions , the consequence that emission from a slower sheath becomes relatively more important in jets at larger angle to the line of sight then resolves difficulties in models that unify bl lac objects with low power radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 _ chandra _  has not only allowed confirmation that x - ray synchrotron emission in low - power jets is common @xcite , but has also resolved transverse structure in the nearest and brightest sources . 
 a particularly interesting example is  @xcite . here 
 the diffuse emission contains a knotty structure in the radio and x - ray that appears to describe an oscillatory filament . 
 although the structure could be the result of a chance superposition of non - axisymmetric knots , the level of coherence led us to suggest that the knots might be predominantly a surface feature residing in the shear layer between the spine and sheath . 
 if this latter interpretation is correct , we might expect the x - ray spectra of the knots to be similar across the transverse width of the jet .    in the case of 
 the distinct knotty emission is only about 10% of the total emission in x - rays and radio along the @xmath0 kpc of projected jet length over which it is detected , and with a source distance of @xmath1  mpc the observations did not allow us to measure separate x - ray spectra for the knots and diffuse emission . at 3.7  mpc ( 1  arcmin is @xmath2  kpc projected length ) , centaurus  a is a much closer example of a low - power radio galaxy whose inner jet shows bright resolved x - ray knots and diffuse emission over a similar projected length scale to  ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 here we report an x - ray spectral study of the transverse structure of the jet , and in particular we investigate whether the  knots are likely to occupy a shear layer between faster inner and slower outer flows . 
 with regions superposed , and rotated to the sky orientation . the regions , called the spine , sheath and background , working outwards from the jet axis , are pie slices from a base position of r.a .

 the inner spine and sheath regions are at a distance of @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the outer region runs from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . 
 we call the region marked in blue , near the outer extent of the inner region , the `` bright '' region . ] 
 the _ chandra _ data used here are from the  very large project ( -vlp ) , comprising six deep ( @xmath9  ks ) exposures ( obsids 7797 , 7798 , 7799 , 7800 , 8489 , 8490 ) of the front - illuminated ccd chips of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) made between 2007 march 7 and may 30 . 
 standard methods have been followed for data re - processing and grade selection , and small astrometric corrections were made to register the six exposures to a common frame using detected point sources @xcite . 
 the 0.8 - 3  kev merged image of the inner @xmath10 of the x - ray jet is shown in figure  [ fig : jet ] . 
 we are interested here in the jet after it has become radiatively bright in both radio and x - ray ( more than @xmath6 from the core , and after knots ax1a , ax1c in the terminology of * ? ? ? 
 * ) until its major decline relative to the radio ( at @xmath11 ) . 
 motivated by , where the fast spine is approximately 60% of the jet width , we have defined regions shown in figure  [ fig : jetregions ] . while not wishing to suggest _ a priori _ that the  jet does have a slower sheath and faster spine , for shorthand we call these regions the _ spine _ , _ sheath _ and _ background _ , working outwards from the jet axis . 
 compact sources excluded from the background regions are also marked . 
 a division of the spine and sheath into two regions with length down the jet is shown . 
 we refer to these as the _ inner _ and _ outer _ regions , and the boundary was chosen so that there is a comparable number of total counts in each region . 
 the jet is positioned on a single acis i chip in all six exposures . 
 the boundary between the outer and inner regions lies between 1.4 and 4.0 arcmin off axis depending on obsid , giving a point - spread - function ( psf ) half - power - diameter ( hpd ) at this location of better than about 1 arcsec at the @xmath12-kev energy of maximum count rate per kev . 
 the readout streak from the  core runs close to the se sheath region in obsid 7797 , and so we exclude this observation in spectral fitting to the se sheath and inner spine . 
 we extract data and responses for identical sky regions in the different obsids , and we fit the same model simultaneously to the data sets . 
 spectra are binned to a minimum of 30 counts per bin so that the @xmath13 statistic can be applied .    in this work 
 we are searching for statistical trends in spectral index in knotty and diffuse emission transverse to the jet axis . 
 knots are identified as bright enhancements , but we believe them to be composed of multiple distinct physical structures , each potentially with a different emission spectrum . 
 the precise definition of knots is therefore not crucial , and we have adopted the previously published lists of @xcite and @xcite , which combined give 31 knots within our total spine and sheath regions . the knots were examined visually , and small centroid shifts ( within uncertainties ) were made to give best alignment in the new data . 
 a circle of nominal radius 2.4 arcsec was used to mask each knot . 
 four additional weak but compact enhancements seen in the new data were also masked as knots with circles of radii 1.2 arcsec . 
 because of our interest in statistical trends , for knots that overlap regions we divide the counts according to where they were detected . 
 when extracting spectra of the knots the diffuse ( residual ) emission in the corresponding region is used as background . 
 the outer sectors shown in figure  [ fig : jetregions ] provide background for the diffuse emission . 
 all our spectral models are single - component power laws with free hydrogen column density , @xmath14 , over the energy range 0.410 kev . 
 intrinsic @xmath14 in  over and above the galactic value of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite causes reductions in the count rate in soft x - ray images , consistent with the dust lanes that cross the jet roughly transverse to its axis . 
 since our regions extend hundreds of pc along the jet , we are combining data with different intrinsic @xmath14 . 
 this is expected to give a bias towards finding slightly flatter power - law slopes than the true slope if the jet emission is characterized by a single spectrum over its length . 
 however , the gradients in @xmath14 are principally down the jet and not across the jet , and so provide similar weightings when we compare sections transverse to the jet axis . 
 we can thus use the fitted @xmath14 and spectral index for our transverse sections of the jet as proxies of systematic trends in the spectra . 
 appreciable cross - jet differences could then allow us to conclude that there are real variations in the x - ray spectrum across the jet . 
 self - consistency tests ( see  [ sec : results ] ) verify this assertion . 
 we also find , through comparison with the spectra of individual knots and sections of diffuse emission along the jet @xcite , that any bias in spectral slope in our analysis is small . 
 in the following , spectral index @xmath17 ( one less than x - ray photon index ) is defined in the sense that flux density is proportional to @xmath18 .

 our spectral results are summarized in table  [ tab : specresults ] , and we refer to them here by row number . the quoted uncertainties are 90% for two interesting parameters , 
 so where pairs of rows disagree in both parameters there is at most a 1% probability of agreement by chance . 
 uncertainties in @xmath17 and @xmath14 are correlated , and so the @xmath13 contours must be examined to assess fully the spectral disagreement . 
 we show such plots only for the comparisons of most interest ( figs . 
 [ fig : contours ] & [ fig : contours2 ] ) . 
 we see ( table  [ tab : specresults ] rows 1 & 2 ) that the sheath spectrum is steeper than the spine . 
 further investigation allows us to find the origin of this result . 
 the nw and se regions of the sheath ( rows 3 & 4 ) give excellent agreement in @xmath17 and @xmath55 , indicating that it is unlikely that the result is from isolated features , and confirming the absence of strong gradients in @xmath55 transverse to the jet . separating the knot and diffuse emission in the spine and sheath ( rows 5 to 8) shows that while the knots have flatter spectra than the diffuse emission , the steeper spectrum in the sheath is caused solely by differences in the knots . in the two - dimensional plane of @xmath17 and @xmath14 , 
 rows 5 and 6 disagree .    , 90% and 99% for two interesting parameters ) showing a significant difference between the spine inner knots ( left contours ) and sheath inner knots ( right contours ) : rows 9 & 10 of table  [ tab : specresults ] . 
 the @xmath56 axis begins at galactic @xmath14 . ]     for the bright region spine knots ( left contours ) and sheath knots ( right contours ) : rows 17 & 18 of table  [ tab : specresults ] . ] 
 having established that the knots in the sheath have a steeper spectrum than in the spine , we checked the inner and outer regions to see if there is any trend with distance from the core . comparing rows 9 and 10 with 11 and 12 , 
 we see the expected preference for a higher @xmath14 in the inner regions , but more interestingly we see that it is only for the knots in the inner regions that the spine and sheath spectra differ ( fig . 
 [ fig : contours ] ) . 
 the diffuse emission , in contrast , shows remarkable spectral agreement between the sheath and spine in the inner region ( rows 13 & 14 ) . to check that the contour separation in figure  [ fig : contours ] is causal rather than statistical we have drawn random sets of the required size from the modelled underlying spectral - index distribution deduced from all knots in the inner region 
 the average spectral index has an error on the mean of @xmath57 for knots matching in number those in the inner spine , and @xmath58 for the inner sheath . 
 the observed spectral - index difference , @xmath59 ( fig .  [ fig : contours ] ) , therefore significantly exceeds the difference expected from random subsamples of the distribution .    since the spine 
 inner jet knots tend to lie in regions of higher @xmath14 than the sheath inner knots ( figs  [ fig : jetregions ] and [ fig : contours ] ) , we have repeated the analysis only for the `` bright '' region , marked in blue on figure  [ fig : jetregions ] . 
 this region is beyond the main dust lanes that cross the jet ( e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ? 
 results are consistent with sheath knots having steeper spectra than spine knots ( fig . 
 [ fig : contours2 ] , and rows 17 & 18 ) . 
 simulations show that the bias (  2 ) on the absolute value of mean spectral index from the @xmath14 distribution over the inner jet is @xmath60 . 
 we investigated the possibility that the spectral flattening in the inner spine might result from the inner knots being brighter , if brightness is associated with particle - acceleration efficiency . 
 figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] shows the knot surface brightness and hardness across the inner jet . 
 the bin - width is 1 degree in position angle , which corresponds roughly to the hpd at an average jet - axis distance , and so the points are not highly correlated . 
 the hardness ratio shows the decrease with increasing distance from the jet axis that is anticipated from our spectral results , with a high degree of confidence that the hardness is not constant . 
 the gradual decrease of hardness with distance from the jet axis shows that our finding of a spectral difference in the spine and sheath regions was not dictated by the _ a priori _ definition of the region boundaries .     for 11 dof for a fit to constant hardness ) . 
 there is no trend for regions of higher integrated knot surface brightness to show harder spectra . ] 
 perhaps surprisingly , a comparison of the panels of figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] shows that there is no trend for regions of higher integrated knot surface brightness to be harder in spectrum . 
 we have made plots similar to figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] for the inner and outer diffuse emission , and the outer knot emission . 
 the surface - brightness profiles of diffuse emission show some lumpiness , suggesting that some of what we call diffuse emission is composed of lower - surface - brightness knots , but all three hardness - ratio profiles are consistent with being constant across the jet ( @xmath13 values of 10.5 , 7.9 , and 14.8 for 11 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , as compared with @xmath13 = 116 in fig .  [ 
 fig : inknotprofile ] ) . 
 if the knots in  were predominantly a surface feature in a shear layer between the spine and sheath , as we suggested might be the case for , one would expect the knot x - ray spectra to be similar across the jet . 
 this is not what is seen . in the inner jet , between @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the core 
 , we have observed in a statistical sense that the x - ray knot spectra steepen farther from the jet axis . 
 no such trend is seen in the more diffuse x - ray emission . 
 the results suggest that knots are distributed throughout the jet volume , with a trend towards steeper spectra in the outer regions . 
 the trend will then be underestimated in our results because of projection effects . 
 although the spectral trends disfavor knot confinement in a shear layer , they imply that the electron energy distributions in knots towards the center and edge of the jet are different . 
 electrons with sufficient energy to emit synchrotron x - rays must be accelerated locally to the knots , since their energy loss timescale is short compared with any dynamical timescale associated with fluid motion . 
 thus the conditions for particle acceleration differ across the jet . 
 the knots might arise from intruders from outside travelling at speeds close to the stellar velocity dispersion , or internal flow irregularities which are most likely to arise in the central part of the flow and might be expected to move quickly towards the edge of the jet under the influence of circulation in the shear layer . in either case 
 a transverse velocity structure might cause the strength of shocks near the knots to vary across the jet , and since the kinetic energy density of the flow should be higher nearer the jet axis , we might also expect velocity irregularities to generate stronger turbulent cascades near the axis than near the jet edge , with consequent efficient particle acceleration @xcite and a flatter on - axis x - ray spectrum . 
 as the jet expands , the lower on - axis flow velocity , as suggested by the less collimated appearance of the jet further from the core , would then imply less x - ray spectral difference between sheath and spine , consistent with our results . 
 indeed , a spectral steepening between the inner and outer regions in diffuse x - ray emission may relate to such a decline in flow speed along the jet ( rows 13 to 16 of table  [ tab : specresults ] ) . 
 it is interesting to ask whether it will be possible to detect knot migration in . 
 expansion of the jet along its axis , with apparent motions of about @xmath61 , has been measured in radio data from the very large array over 10 years @xcite , but lateral motion is more difficult to measure . it has been detected in the radio in m87 @xcite . 
 we speculate that transverse motions should be present in the knots and are potentially detectable if knots are flow irregularities , although future observations may be required . 
 these new observations of  have permitted the first x - ray spectral study of a radio jet in the transverse direction , separating knotty and more diffuse emission . 
 we have found the striking result that where the x - ray emission is brightest , at @xmath62 to 1.2 kpc from the core , the spectrum in the knotty emission is steeper at larger distances from the jet axis . 
 we speculate that this is the result of lateral knot migration .

85,"in recent years the study of stochastic systems has become an attractive and important research field in modern statistical physics . 
 this is mainly based on the fact that in particular a lot of interdisciplinary problems are described best by probabilistic models . 
 in addition , many stochastic processes represent simple nonequilibrium systems and may serve as a kind of toy models for the evaluation of a still outstanding nonequilibrium theory .    in this work we focus on the asymmetric random average process ( arap ) @xcite . 
 the model is defined on a lattice and equipped with a probabilistic nearest neighbour interaction . 
 this is in common with most stochastic models , especially with the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , representing somewhat like a standard model of nonequilibrium physics . 
 however , the state variables of the arap located at the lattice sites are continuous and unbounded while most of the models known deal with discrete and even finite local state spaces .    nevertheless , the arap is not an artificial construction . 
 many physical problems are rather located in continuous than in discrete space . 
 e.g. , it is closely related with the q - model of granular media @xcite . the traffic model of krauss @xcite 
 can also be mapped onto the arap @xcite . 
 furthermore , the arap may show some new phenomena undiscovered in discrete systems so far , e.g. , in @xcite a new kind of twofoldly broken ergodicity has been studied . 
 the results presented in this paper are structured as follows .    in section [ ch_definition ] 
 we give a definition of the arap in context of the so - called quantum formalism of stochastic processes @xcite . 
 this is useful for the application of the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) presented in section [ ch_mpa ] .    in sections 
 [ ch_pms ] and [ ch_mpa ] we focus on araps with interactions leading to factorized steady states . in @xcite these interactions 
 have been identified , however , the calculation was not rigorously and involved a unproven conjecture . according to this , we complete the outstanding proof in section [ ch_pms ] . 
 furthermore , we derive an _ explicit _ functional representation of the interactions , so - called beta densities , and discuss the influence of finite system sizes . 
 finally , in section [ ch_mpa ] we apply the matrix product ansatz to araps with interactions identified in the previous section . 
 this approach has been successfully developed for quantum spin chains and stochastic systems in the last decade ( see section [ ch_mpa ] for references ) , however , it has always been applied to systems with discrete state variables . here 
 we enhance its validity to systems with continuous state spaces . 
 the corresponding algebras become compact functional equations with closed solutions .    in the conclusion 
 we discuss the mpa for araps with interactions that do not lead to product measure steady states . 
 the arap is defined on a 1d periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites . 
 each site @xmath1 carries a non - negative continuous mass variable @xmath2 . 
 the dynamics is given in discrete time and every time step @xmath3 for each site a random number @xmath4 $ ] is generated from a time - independent probability density function @xmath5 , called _ 
 fraction density_. the fraction @xmath6 determines the amount of mass @xmath7 transported from site @xmath1 to site @xmath8 . 
 the transport is completely asymmetric , i.e. , no mass moves in the opposite direction @xmath9 , and we obtain @xmath10 these update rules correspond to a parallel dynamics and are illustrated in figure [ modelbase_fig ] . 
 so there are only three parameters in the arap : first , the system size @xmath0 and the mass density @xmath11 whereby @xmath12 represents the total mass . due to mass conserving dynamics 
 the density is fixed and accordingly @xmath13 can be considered as a thermodynamic variable . 
 however , the most powerful `` parameter '' is given by the fraction density @xmath14 which allows the arap to be customized to a lot of interdisciplinary problems . in @xcite 
 some stochastic models have been rewritten in context of the arap by the use of suitable @xmath14-functions , e.g. , the q - model from granular media or the krauss - model from traffic flow theory .    now the arap will be presented in terms of the so - called quantum formalism for stochastic processes , e.g. , used in @xcite . 
 we consider the orthonormal state space which is spanned by the continuous ket basis @xmath15 with configuration vectors @xmath16 and equipped with the inner product @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 represents the @xmath18-function ) . 
 correspondingly states of the arap at time @xmath19 are given by    @xmath20    whereby @xmath21 is a non - negative probability measure or reworded : @xmath22 gives the probability density of finding the system in the configuration @xmath23 at time @xmath19 . here 
 the abbreviated form @xmath24 with @xmath25 has been introduced . 
 furthermore we assume @xmath26 to be normalized , i.e. @xmath27 .    our main aim is to calculate the function @xmath26 which corresponds to the solution of the problem . in case of the parallel dynamics given above 
 we obtain the following @xmath28 map of the basis : @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 here @xmath32 represents an @xmath33 matrix with diagonal elements @xmath34 and lower band entries @xmath6 . based on periodic boundary conditions 
 the top right entry is also unequal to zero , i.e. @xmath35 . so @xmath36 is nothing else than the compact matrix formulation of ( [ mass_update ] ) . 
 note that @xmath32 operates on the space of configuration vectors @xmath23 , whereas @xmath37 operates on the state space spanned by @xmath38 . 
 evaluating @xmath39 by using the relations ( [ state]),([par_upd_basis ] ) and ( [ t_matrix ] ) we finally obtain the master equation @xmath40 representing the fundamental dynamical equation of the arap . here the expression @xmath41 represents the transition probability density from state @xmath38 into state @xmath42 . 
 from now on we would like to focus on steady state dynamics only , i.e. , we look for time - independent solutions @xmath43 of ( [ mgl_par ] ) . 
 this simplifies the master equation to the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 . for ergodic 
 araps , defined by dynamics that allow the system to evolve from any given initial state to any final state in a finite time , the steady state is equal to the infinite time limit , so @xmath45 . 
 although we do not focus on araps with discrete masses or other kind of updates in this paper , we would like to mention that it is straightforward to deduce the corresponding master equations from ( [ mgl_par ] ) . 
 e.g. , the discrete arap is embedded canonically by using @xmath18-functions , whereas araps with continuous time dynamics can be treated by a suitable chosen fraction density that interpolates between parallel and random sequential ( = continuous time ) updates . 
 both cases are explicitly treated in @xcite . 
 furthermore , we do not take into account systems with state - dependent fraction densities , e.g. , given by @xmath46 ( here the probability of mass shifts also depends on the height of the column ) . 
 although these araps may show interesting phenomena @xcite , an analytical treatment is more difficult in general . 
 so , the arap with continuous state variables , discrete parallel update and state - independent fraction density @xmath47 spans an appropriate framework for analytical research . 
 we hope that a lot of results can be transferred to related araps in a next step . 
 in this section the complete set of araps with product measure solutions @xmath48 is presented , i.e. , we determine rigorously the set @xmath49 of all @xmath14-functions leading to factorized mass distributions . 
 basically , we complete the proof of @xcite which includes a conjecture based on high order computations so far . 
 furthermore , the fraction densities of @xmath49 are given in a closed form in contrast to our previous paper @xcite where the @xmath14-functions are in moment representation only . 
 finally , we briefly discuss the influence of the system size @xmath0 .      in @xcite 
 it is shown by a constructive approach that @xmath49 is a two parametric set of @xmath14-functions , determined by the first and second @xmath14-moments @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are defined by @xmath52 . 
 these free parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 have to be chosen with respect to the general moment properties @xmath53 only . then the higher moments are uniquely determined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 through @xmath54 with @xmath55    from now on we neglect for simplicity the special case @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 and leading to product measure solutions generated by @xmath58 . 
 in particular , these singular @xmath18-densities will not be considered as elements of @xmath49 . for completeness 
 we present the factorized mass densities associated with ( [ moment_criterion ] ) , also deduced in @xcite : @xmath59    please note that the _ uniqueness _ of the higher moments @xmath60 has already been proven in @xcite . correspondingly , the densities given above span the complete set @xmath49 . 
 however , the explicit form ( [ moment_criterion ] ) is a conjecture that has only been shown rigorously for @xmath61 . according to this , 
 our approach in this section is canonical : we first derive explicitly the fraction densities related to ( [ moment_criterion ] ) and after that we show that these @xmath14-functions really lead to factorized mass distributions . 
 this will complete the outstanding proof . 
 we start by rewriting ( [ moment_criterion ] ) as a recurrence relation : @xmath62 then we define the generating function @xmath63 from @xmath64 we derive that @xmath65 is an entire function and consequently well defined . 
 in addition , the relation @xmath66 holds and @xmath67 is the characteristic function of @xmath14 .    from ( [ rec_moment_criterion ] ) and ( [ char_func_phi ] ) the differential equation @xmath68 is derived after some algebra which is nothing else than kummer s equation @xcite . 
 this ordinary differential equation of second order is elaborated very well , e.g. , it appears in context of the hydrogen atom , and so we may rely on a huge pool of known results @xcite . 
 for linear differential equations of second order there are always two independent solutions . but here , only one of them , the so - called kummer m - function @xmath69 , is analytical in @xmath70 as long as @xmath71 is not a negative integer . 
 this is ensured by ( [ parameter_space ] ) and ( [ moment_criterion_lambda ] ) . 
 consulting @xcite yields for the special case @xmath72 , which is also satisfied here , the integral representation @xmath73 which finally gives an explicit representation of @xmath14 by comparison with ( [ char_func_phi_2 ] ) .    at last , 
 this functional solution is rewritten in terms of parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 instead of @xmath71 and @xmath76 to simplify the representation of @xmath49 . by the transformation @xmath77 and 
 @xmath78 a symmetric form of the fraction densities is achieved and we get @xmath79 these are so - called beta densities which are very common in probability theory @xcite . at this 
 , the normalization constant is given by the beta function @xmath80    although the mean field models ( [ mcont_def ] ) are parameterized by a two - dimensional manifold , the associated mass distributions ( [ mfsol_p ] ) are connected to a one - dimensional parameter space only , i.e. , several @xmath81 functions yield identical stationary states with @xmath82 
 . however , we have to keep in mind that this conclusion concerns only the steady state . 
 the relaxation into the stationary state could differ completely . 
 now we briefly discuss the product measure araps ( [ mcont_def ] ) into more detail . 
 in dependence of the fraction density the process may behave from even critical ( @xmath83 ) to deterministic ( @xmath84 ) . here 
 critical araps are characterized by an algebraic mass decay @xcite . 
 they are realized by dynamics that either shift the total mass located on a lattice site or forbid the transport . 
 in general , there are three classes of @xmath49-densities : continuous functions with @xmath85 , single peak functions with @xmath86 or @xmath87 and double peak functions with @xmath88 . 
 only double peak functions may result into mass densities @xmath89 that diverge for @xmath90 . 
 this reflects an almost critical behaviour because either transports of no mass ( @xmath91 ) or the total mass ( @xmath92 ) are preferred . 
 however , all classes may generate gaussian - like mass densities with an algebraic increase for small masses . 
 furthermore , it is interesting that continuous and single peak densities , resp . 
 single and double peak densities , may lead to identical mass distributions , whereas , this is impossible in case of continuous and double peak araps .    for @xmath93 
 we obtain the simplest version of the arap with uniform distribution @xmath94 . 
 we will refer to this system as the free arap . 
 in particular , there is no explicit truncation which can forbid or suppress a transport of fractions bigger than a critical value , e.g. discussed in @xcite . 
 now we prove that the densities ( [ mcont_def ] ) really lead to factorized mass distributions according to ( [ mfsol_p ] ) . in @xcite 
 a simple criterion has been presented which makes it possible to determine and verify mean field solutions : only product measure mass densities ( [ pmsols ] ) satisfy the equation @xmath95 with @xmath96 and single site laplace - transform @xmath97 . 
 hence , ( [ cond2_q ] ) represents a sufficient criterion for testing the validity of product measure solutions . in the following paragraphs 
 we will show that the mass densities ( [ mfsol_p ] ) meet the condition ( [ cond2_q ] ) . 
 the laplace - transform of ( [ mfsol_p ] ) is given by @xmath98 then , using ( [ mcont_def ] ) and ( [ mfsol_q ] ) with ( [ mapping ] ) leads to @xmath99 \right)^{\lambda } } \;.\ ] ] evaluation of the r.h.s . 
 of ( [ mapping_here ] ) can be done by use of the so - called feynman parameters which are a well - known tool in field theory . 
 they are nothing else than the formula @xmath100 here @xmath101 are real and positive , whereas @xmath102 may be complex . 
 a derivation of ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) is given in @xcite . 
 now we simply apply the values @xmath103 integrate over @xmath104 , relabel @xmath105 , and finally equation ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) rereads as @xmath106 \right)^{\lambda } } \;.\ ] ] together with ( [ mapping_here ] ) we derive @xmath107 from this follows directly the validity of condition ( [ cond2_q ] ) which completes the proof . 
 the formula ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) has already successfully been used in context of the q - model @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction this fundamental process of granular media 
 is strongly related with the arap . 
 however , only symmetric araps defined by symmetric fraction densities @xmath108 can be mapped onto the q - model @xcite . 
 correspondingly , the application of feynman parameters has been generalized to antisymmetric @xmath14-functions here . 
 the calculations in @xcite have only been focused on systems in the thermodynamic limit @xmath109 . 
 but , also in case of finite systems the mean - field criterion ( [ cond2_q ] ) is valid and sufficient which can be shown in almost the same manner as done in @xcite . 
 so araps with beta densities are of product measure form irrespective of the system size @xmath0 . 
 however , for @xmath110 the configuration space is restricted to the hyperplane @xmath111 due to mass conserving dynamics . 
 accordingly , the mass density has to be renormalized and we obtain @xmath112 with @xmath113 thus , projection onto the @xmath114 surface , i.e. fixing the total mass , corresponds to shifting our focus from grand - canonical to a canonical point of view whereby @xmath115 corresponds to the canonical partition sum . 
 a detailed calculation of @xmath115 is given in [ z_prove ] . 
 one should keep in mind that the exact solutions ( [ p_finite ] ) are still of product measure form if restricted to @xmath114 . 
 however , this coincidence with the @xmath116 case is only formal , e.g. , the one - site mass density is _ not _ simply given by @xmath117 . 
 one has to take into account the additional interaction induced by the restriction @xmath118 . 
 so we derive by using the relation ( [ z_relation ] ) again :    @xmath119 
 in this section we solve araps with @xmath49-densities by using a matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) . 
 this technique has been initially introduced for calculating exact ground states of quantum spin chains @xcite . 
 shortly after , derrida and coworkers have successfully applied the mpa to a nonequilibrium system , namely the asep with random sequential dynamics @xcite . meanwhile the mpa has been evolved to a standard tool for one - dimensional stochastic models , e.g. @xcite and references therein . 
 however , its field of application so far is mainly restricted to variants of the asep ( different updates , local defects or two species of particles ) .    in general the mpa 
 is applied to systems defined on a two - dimensional local state space , i.e. , sites can be vacant or occupied . in this case , manageable sets of algebraic objects ( corresponding to the local states ) and algebraic relations ( reflecting the local dynamics ) are obtained . 
 for example the asep provides one condition , @xmath120 , where the objects @xmath121 and @xmath122 correspond to holes and particles . nevertheless , it is rather complicated to find ( matrix ) representations of that poorly defined algebra @xcite . 
 an extension to a model with an arbitrary , but still finite , number of local states is given in @xcite .    here 
 we apply the mpa to a stochastic system with _ continuous _ state variables . 
 as seen in the previous section , mean field is exact for fraction densities taken from @xmath49 , i.e. , the corresponding algebras have one - dimensional representations and are given by a functional equation . 
 we derive mass solutions in agreement with the results given in section [ ch_pms ] . 
 so an alternative approach for the calculation of steady states is presented in this paper . 
 this may show new perspectives in the treatment of other araps which are unsolved so far . 
 e.g. , the free arap with continuous time update still lacks an exact description of the steady state . 
 also the state - dependent models given by mass - dependent fraction densities @xmath46 could be treated by the mpa . 
 finally , our work extends the scope of the mpa to systems with unbounded and continuous state spaces ! 
 thus , we have to deal with functions and functional equations instead of discrete objects . for this 
 , we may fall back on the well elaborated field of functional theory . 
 so , although things get in principal more complex  measured in degrees of freedom 
 life becomes easier .      in this section 
 we derive the matrix algebra of the arap in the thermodynamic limit . 
 we start with the `` defect '' matrix product ansatz for backward sequential dynamics @xcite . 
 a definition of the backward sequential update is presented in the [ bs ] whereas a detailed introduction to the mpa for stochastic systems can be found in the references given in the introduction of this section . 
 therefore , we assume the local interaction to obey @xmath123 with @xmath124 here @xmath125 spans the infinite and continuous local state space of a single site and the tensor product is defined as usual , i.e. @xmath126 whereby we have used @xmath127 . 
 this is in accordance with the notation introduced in section [ ch_definition ] . 
 note that the algebraic objects @xmath122 and @xmath128 depend on a continuous parameter @xmath129 reflecting the mass located on a lattice site . 
 it is easy to see that @xmath130 represents a steady state under backward sequential dynamics @xmath131 the operator @xmath132 is defined by the local interaction @xmath19 acting on sites @xmath1 and @xmath8 . for further information about update procedures please refer to @xcite . 
 note that trace operator @xmath133 and time evolution operator @xmath134 commute because @xmath133 acts on the auxiliary space of the algebraic objects whereas @xmath134 is defined on the state space . here 
 the trace operator shall ensure translational invariance of the steady state .    in the thermodynamic limit the parallel update corresponds to the backward sequential update ( see [ bs ] ) , so the defect can be neglected and we obtain @xmath135    now we give the explicit definition of the local dynamics . 
 first , we change notation ( or , more formal , the basis ) uniquely in the following way @xmath136 because the local dynamics is mass conserving 
 . then , the representation of the local interaction reads as follows : @xmath137 here @xmath138 represents the so - called fragment density , giving the probability ( density ) that a fragment of size @xmath139 is broken of a stick with mass @xmath129 . 
 the densities @xmath138 and @xmath14 are simply related by @xmath140    using ( [ mpa_d])([dotp ] ) with ( [ basis_c])([f_def ] ) yields after some calculation the matrix algebra in form of a functional equation : @xmath141 for a detailed derivation we refer to [ app_alg ] . 
 please note that we are confronted with _ one condition _ and _ two objects _ only . 
 this is remarkable due to the immense degrees of freedom . in discrete systems 
 every local state corresponds to a single algebraic object , e.g. , in the asep we deal with an object @xmath121 for empty sites and @xmath122 for occupied sites . 
 accordingly , unbounded local state spaces yield an infinite number of algebraic objects . 
 additionally , the number of conditions derived from the local dynamics and defining relations between the algebraic objects depends quadratically on the number of local states . 
 so , increasing the degrees of local freedom makes it more difficult to find representations of the algebraic objects that fulfill all conditions . 
 even more fascinating is that in case of continuous system things become easier again ! 
 the algebraic objects condense to functions and many conditions summarize in one functional equation . 
 in general @xmath143 and @xmath144 are arbitrary algebraic objects and sometimes it is possible to derive information about the underlying system without finding a concrete representation , e.g. , this has been done for the asep in @xcite where some quantities like the flux have been calculated by recurrently solving the algebraic relations . usually one tries to find a matrix representation fulfilling the dynamical conditions . 
 here one distinguishes one - dimensional and higher dimensional representations because one - dimensional representations correspond to product measure solutions ( [ pmsols ] ) always , whereas higher dimensional solutions incorporate additional correlations and show that the process can not be solved by a mean field ansatz .    in this subsection 
 we will focus on araps with @xmath142-functions , i.e. @xmath145 , given by @xmath146 and part of the class @xmath49 . without any further input from section [ ch_pms ] we will derive the according mass densities by the matrix product technique , i.e. , by solving the algebraic equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) . 
 since we are looking for product measure solutions , we assume a one - dimensional representation of @xmath122 and @xmath128 . even without knowing that such solutions exist 
 , one would always try to solve a problem by the simplest ansatz . 
 if this approach fails , we would look for higher dimensional representations . 
 this means that @xmath122 and @xmath128 are nothing else than _ functions _ with one real parameter . 
 in particular , @xmath122 and @xmath128 commute and we assume them to be differentiable .    using @xmath142 with ( [ algebra_c ] ) we obtain @xmath147 then differentiating with respect to @xmath129 generates after rearrangement @xmath148 a differential equation with two functions and two variables @xmath149 and @xmath129 . 
 for @xmath150 the explicit @xmath75-dependence vanishes and ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) reduces to @xmath151   = \frac{1}{m } \;.\ ] ] directly the relation @xmath152 is obtained . 
 inserting this solution in ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) enables us to extract @xmath122 from the algebra and after some calculus we derive @xmath153 with @xmath154 for the free arap , i.e. @xmath155 , the r.h.s .  of ( [ rel_e ] ) 
 is equal to zero . 
 then @xmath156 has to be constant because ( [ rel_e ] ) has to be valid for all @xmath157 . 
 thus , we get @xmath158 . for arbitrary @xmath75 
 we rewrite the r.h.s .  of ( [ rel_e ] ) by expansion into partial fractions and 
 achieve the difference equation @xmath159 its general and unique solution is given by @xmath160 ( at this we used the same argument as for the @xmath155 case ) . by the help of definition ( [ def_h ] ) we obtain @xmath161 and 
 finally @xmath162 by ( [ rel_d_e ] ) .    in case of a one - dimensional solution 
 the trace operator in ( [ p_d ] ) becomes redundant and the identity @xmath163 is valid . 
 using the boundary conditions @xmath164 and @xmath165 , we determine the constants @xmath166 and @xmath167 and obtain the single - site mass density @xmath168 which is in perfect accordance with ( [ mfsol_p ] ) . 
 we emphasize that the matrix product ansatz offers a big advantage compared to other approaches dealing with product measure solutions : we do not have to prove the exactness of the solution ( [ mpasol ] ) . 
 usually one assumes the master equation to be solved by a solution of type ( [ pmsols ] ) , i.e. , we make a so - called mean - field ansatz and look for solutions @xcite . 
 the next step is to show that the mean - field ansatz is really correct , i.e. , we have to prove that all higher correlations or joint probability densities decompose . 
 although in @xcite this extensive task has been reduced by deduction of the criterion ( [ cond2_q ] ) , the step of testing remains : mean - field solutions have to satisfy ( [ cond2_q ] ) for all @xmath169 and @xmath170 . 
 however , in case of the matrix product technique the proof of exactness is delivered for free . 
 the construction of the steady state ensures its exactness ( see subsection [ ch_algebra ] ) and the dimensionality of the representation gives information about the correlations .      here the matrix algebra for beta densities with arbitrary @xmath75 and @xmath171 
 is considered . as in the previous section 
 we derive the corresponding differential equations involving @xmath122 and @xmath128 , however , these become more complex and we have to treat them for each @xmath74 separately . 
 we present the @xmath172 case in detail and refer to the problems in finding closed solutions for arbitrary @xmath74 . 
 starting point is ( [ algebra_c ] ) with fraction densities ( [ mcont_def ] ) . introducing @xmath173 we rewrite the functional equation to @xmath174 now we assume @xmath74 to be integer and derive the relation @xmath175 for further information please consult [ app_abl ] . 
 so , by an @xmath74 times differentiation the integral expression disappears and combination of ( [ func2 ] ) and ( [ rel_der ] ) yields the equation @xmath176 = ( -)^a \frac{\gamma(a+b)}{\gamma(b ) }   m^{1-(a+b ) } d(m ) \bar{d}(s - m ) \;.\ ] ] for @xmath145 we obtain ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) . defining @xmath177 , evaluating the expression on the l.h.s . of ( [ diff_1 ] ) and setting @xmath178 results in @xmath179 here the upper index denotes the @xmath180 derivative . 
 thus , equation ( [ dgl ] ) represents a homogeneous linear differential equation of order @xmath74 in @xmath122 and @xmath181 respectively . in terms of @xmath182 
 it is even nonlinear . 
 henceforth , one may apply the following strategy as done in the previous section : first we try to solve ( [ dgl ] ) in @xmath128 , i.e. , we obtain a relation @xmath183 . 
 then , we insert this result into ( [ diff_1 ] ) , obtain an equation with @xmath128 only and try to solve it . 
 however , this approach becomes more difficult for @xmath184 because the corresponding differential equations are more complex . 
 as an example , we would like to discuss the case @xmath172 into detail . 
 for this ( [ dgl ] ) transforms into @xmath185 to simplify ( [ dgl_2 ] ) we make use of the substitutions @xmath186 and @xmath187 so that a nonlinear differential equation of first order is achieved finally : @xmath188 + \left [ d(m ) - g(m ) \right]^2 = \frac{b(1+b)}{m^2 } \;.\ ] ] unfortunately , we are not able to give a general solution of ( [ diff_2 ] ) representing a riccati equation in @xmath189 @xcite . 
 this is based on the fact that @xmath190 is also an unknown function . 
 therefore , we can not apply elaborated solution schemes for this type of equation here @xcite .    nevertheless , we are able to present a special solution of ( [ diff_2 ] ) given by @xmath191 with @xmath192 . going back , 
 exact expressions for @xmath122 and @xmath128 are derived , especially @xmath193 . 
 although these functions do not fulfill the overall condition ( [ diff_1 ] ) for @xmath172 , this heuristic approach yields the correct form of @xmath122 ( see below ) , but an erroneous defect term @xmath128 . 
 however , we have not exploited the relations between @xmath122 and @xmath128 to the full . according to this , 
 we are confronted with three parameters @xmath194,@xmath195 and @xmath167 now , whereas in the previous section only two unknown constants occurred . 
 to avoid this situation , the second mass moment @xmath196 is used as a third condition . 
 it has been calculated exactly in @xcite . with a final reassignment @xmath197 the solution @xmath198 
 is obtained which is in perfect accordance with ( [ mfsol_p ] ) . 
 so the case @xmath172 differs completely from the case @xmath145 presented in the previous section : it seems to be impossible to derive both , @xmath122 and @xmath128 from the algebraic equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) . 
 we have to keep in mind that the defect term @xmath128 is merely an auxiliary construct and not part of the final solution ( [ p_d ] ) . 
 accordingly , there could be some freedom of choice for the defect . 
 e.g. , a lot of matrix product solutions for stochastic systems are characterized by an a priori choice of the defect terms @xcite . 
 this simplifies the algebra and leads to the proper solutions . in this way , ( [ ans_sol ] ) represents a suitable choice of the defect function @xmath190 .    in principle 
 , one could try to solve the algebra for @xmath199 explicitly and propose the general form ( [ mfsol_p ] ) for arbitrary @xmath74 . 
 but this approach is discontenting . on the one hand 
 , we do not know about the complexity and resolvability for increasing integer @xmath74 . on the other hand 
 , we do not provide a method of resolution for not - integer @xmath74 . 
 finally , we are still lacking of an enclosing mpa calculus that is valid for all @xmath49 densities . 
 however , the mpa might nevertheless be useful for special araps with non factorizing mass densities . 
 in this paper we have focused on the asymmetric random average process under parallel dynamics . in the first part ( section [ ch_pms ] ) 
 it has been rigorously proven that only araps equipped with beta densities and @xmath18-densities lead to product measure solutions . here , our calculations have completed a derivation given previously in @xcite . in a second part ( section [ ch_mpa ] ) 
 we have presented an alternative approach , a matrix product ansatz , for deriving the mass densities under use of beta densities . restricted to fraction densities 
 @xmath142 we have given a complete calculation of the associated mass densities . 
 for the remaining densities @xmath81 with @xmath184 we have outlined an approach based on differential equations . 
 altogether , we have extended the scope of the mpa to systems with continuous and unbounded state variables .    however , due to the restriction to araps in class @xmath49 we deal with a one - dimensional representation of the algebraic objects @xmath122 and @xmath128 only . in a next step , 
 we should concentrate on araps with non - vanishing correlations which is associated with higher dimensional representations of the algebraic objects . 
 especially , we believe that the mpa could be the appropriate tool to solve the free arap with @xmath94 under continuous time dynamics . although this process is given by a rather simple fraction density it does not belong to the class of mean - field models @xcite . furthermore , araps with state - dependent fraction densities @xmath46 could be treated with the mpa . 
 this could bring forward the analysis of truncated processes . on the other hand 
 , we could ask for @xmath14-functions that lead to solvable algebras , i.e. , solvable functional equations . 
 in addition , the question arises if the algebraic objects of correlated araps are always representable by matrices , i.e. @xmath200 . or is it even possible to construct araps that are solved by algebraic objects with continuous representations ? 
 finally , one could identify the class of araps whose stationary states may be written as matrix products 
 . this would be very similar to @xcite where it has been shown that stochastic processes with a finite number of local states , a finite range of interaction and continuous time dynamics are ( formally ) always solved by mpa . 
 we like to thank j h snoeijer and j m j van leeuwen for very interesting discussions , especially the reference to the asymmetric representation of the feynman parameters has been very useful . we also like to thank blint tth , jesus garca , pablo ferrari and gunter schtz for helpful discussions . 
 a schadschneider thanks the daad for support and the institute for mathematics and statistics at the university of sao paulo for its hospitality during the final stages of this work . 
 we present a proof of the relation @xmath202 the superscript in @xmath203 reminds of the @xmath13 dependence . 
 the following calculation uses the fourier representation of the @xmath18-function and the relation between ( [ mfsol_p ] ) and ( [ mfsol_q ] ) , i.e. , the principles of laplace transformation : @xmath204 so the r.h.s . of ( [ z_relation ] ) is nothing else than a single site mass density ( [ mfsol_p ] ) for the total mass @xmath205 that is rescaled according to @xmath206 and @xmath207 . 
 in the backward sequential update one starts updating an arbitrary pair of sites ( @xmath208 ) and applies the local update rules , @xmath209 from right to left , i.e. , opposite to the direction of the mass transport , under consideration of periodicity until reaching the initial pair . 
 thus , for finite @xmath0 the backward sequential update differs slightly from parallel dynamics because the last pair of sites @xmath210 to be updated holds the site @xmath8 that has been updated already . 
 however , in the infinite system @xmath211 this `` error '' vanishes because the difference between both update procedures is local and not extensive with @xmath0 . correspondingly the parallel update is equivalent to the backward sequential dynamics in the thermodynamic limit . 
 putting ( [ mpa_d])([dotp ] ) and ( [ basis_c])([f_def ] ) together we obtain the expression @xmath212 we introduce the linear substitution @xmath213 and @xmath214 that comes along with the trivial jacobian determinant @xmath215 . 
 therefore , the transformation of ( [ alg_1 ] ) becomes rather simple : @xmath216 here the change of variables generates a structure according to @xmath217 . 
 since @xmath218 are linearly independent we are able to reduce the condition ( [ mpa_d ] ) to the functional equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) . 
 the essential component of the calculation is the formula @xmath219 which can be verified easily .    by the help of ( [ formel ] ) it is straightforward to prove ( [ rel_der ] ) by induction . in particular 
 , the correspondent term of @xmath220 reduces to zero for @xmath221 . 
 however , for @xmath222 induction finally leads to the case @xmath223 which can not be treated by ( [ formel ] ) because the counterpart of @xmath220 , i.e. , basically @xmath224 at @xmath225 , is divergent here . 
 therefore , we have restricted to @xmath74 of integer form .",0.35315883627055805,0.10495626822157401,0.589471280574798,0.336264317180616,0.07441860465116201,0.549984037876129,0.20102139841195402,0.032786885245901,0.506388306617736,0
86,"optomechanical cooling of micro- and nano - mechanical resonators to their quantum ground state , is used in a wide variety of sensitive measurements such as detection of weak forces @xcite , small masses @xcite and small displacements @xcite . 
 such mechanical resonators can also be used as tools for quantum metrology @xcite or as a medium to couple hybrid quantum systems @xcite . in recent years , different types of optomechanical systems have established considerable cooling of the vibrational modes of mechanical resonators interacting with optical cavity @xcite . in such systems , 
 the cavity exerts radiation pressure on the mirror . 
 the dynamics of the mirror is coherently controlled by an external pump laser . 
 therefore , by modifying the pump power , a strong coupling regime can be easily acheived @xcite . 
 in such a strong coupling regime , the mechanical oscillator can be cooled to its quantum ground state using the dynamics of back - action @xcite . 
 experimentally , significant cooling of the mechanical mode of the resonator coupled to an optical cavity has been attained by using two different ways of radiation pressure interaction between the intracavity field and a vibrational mode : back - action cooling @xcite and cold damping feedback @xcite . 
 self cooling of the mechanical resonator via dynamical back - action arises due to its interaction with the optical cavity through radiation pressure @xcite . 
 depending upon the laser detuning , the correlations , induced by the cavity delay , between the brownian motion of the resonator and the radiation pressure force lead to either cooling or amplification . 
 experimentally , a single mechanical mode has been cooled using these effects @xcite . with the back - action cooling or self cooling , 
 there is self modification in the dynamics of the mechanical system as the off resonant operation of the cavity results in the retarded dynamical back - action on the system @xcite . 
 cold damping quantum feedback technique is used to cool the oscillating mirror by applying a viscous force on the mirror via radiation pressure generated by another intensity modulated laser beam on the back of the mirror @xcite . 
 this technique increases the damping of the system without any additional noise @xcite . 
 other feedback scheme requires very large mechanical quality factor @xcite for the ground state cooling of the oscillator whereas cooling can be much more conveniently achieved in the cold damping scheme . 
 the optomechanical systems composed of ultracold atoms enclose within a cavity has grabbed much attention@xcite . 
 the resonance frequency of the cavity is altered due to the strong interaction of the condensed atoms with the cavity mode @xcite . 
 an all - optical transistor based on a coupled bose - einstein condensate(bec ) cavity system @xcite has been proposed @xcite . 
 an optomechanical system consisting of bec in an optical cavity has been investigated recently @xcite . by virtue of interaction of bec with mechanical oscillator , 
 such hybrid system was helpful in acheiving state engineering of the mechanical mode of oscillator , which can be easily controlled and highy insensitive to noise effects . 
 experimentally , interaction between the ultracold atoms and vibrating membrane has been studied @xcite . in our previous work 
 , we have investigated how the stochastic cooling feedback technique together with a gas of condensate confined in an optical cavity can be used to detect weak forces and coherently controls the sensitivity of this hybrid optomechanical system @xcite .    motivated by these interesting features in the field of cavity opto - mechanics and bec 
 , we compare the two schemes i.e. , back - action cooling and cold damping quantum feedback , for cooling an optomechanical system in which a bec is coupled to an optical cavity with a movable mirror . by comparing these two schemes for such a system , we found that the cold damping quantum feedback scheme cools the mechanical oscillator to its ground state in the bad cavity limit ( @xmath0 ) i.e , when cavity bandwidth is greater than the mechanical frequency while the back - action cooling is efficient in the opposite limit of good cavity ( @xmath1 ) i.e. , when cavity bandwidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency . 
 we also show that for both the schemes , in the presence of atom - atom coupling , the interaction of the vibrational mode of the mirror , single mode of the intracavity field and the condensate fluctuations give rise to normal mode splitting . 
 in this section , we introduce our model and describe the hamiltonian for our system . 
 our model consists of an elongated cigar shaped gas of n two - level bec atoms of @xmath2 in the @xmath3 state with mass @xmath4 and transition frequency @xmath5 of the @xmath3 @xmath6 @xmath7 transition of the @xmath8 line . 
 the bec atoms strongly interact with a single one - dimensional quantized cavity mode of frequency @xmath9 . 
 the cavity has one mirror fixed and another mirror movable of mass @xmath10 which acts as a mechanical oscillator that is free to oscillate at mechanical frequency @xmath11 . the coherent laser field with frequency @xmath12 drives the system through the fixed cavity mirror with amplitude @xmath13 . 
 the cavity and the laser field are treated quantum mechanically as the standing wave and the pump laser are weak ( small photon number ) . 
 the single - particle hamiltonian in the rotating wave and dipole approximation for the system under consideration is read as @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 represents the kinetic energy of the condensate . 
 @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 in which the first term gives the energy of the light mode , with lowering ( raising ) operator @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20=1 $ ] ) and cavity - pump detuning @xmath21 . 
 the second term in @xmath16 is the energy due to external pump laser . 
 a band pass filter is used in the detection scheme @xcite such that only a single vibrational mode can be considered by neglecting the several other mechanical degrees of freedom arising from the radiation pressure . 
 @xmath22 gives the energy of the single vibrational mode of the cantilever with annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ( @xmath25=1 $ ] ) . as a result of the pressure exerted by the intracavity photons on the mirrors 
 , there is an optomechanical coupling between the vibrating mirror and the cavity field . 
 hence a force is exerted on the movable mirror by the electromagnetic field which depends on the number of photons in the cavity . 
 this field is phase shifted by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wave vector of light field and @xmath28 is the displacement of the mirror from its equilibrium position . 
 the scattering of the photons into other modes of the electromagnetic field can be ignored and hence validating the single mode approximation of the cavity field . 
 also , a reservoir having finite temperature @xmath29 is attached to the movable mirror . in the absence of the radiation pressure exerted by the optical cavity field , the cantilever can undergo brownian motion due to its contact with thermal environment . 
 @xmath30 describes the interaction of the light field with the bec which involves the classical potential @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the optical lattice barrier height per photon given by @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35(@xmath36 ) representing the mirror - atom coupling and atom - pump detuning respectively . 
 we take @xmath37 as in this case condensate atom moves towards the nodes of the optical field due to which the lowest bound state is localized at these positions . therefore compared to the case @xmath38 , the interaction between the optical cavity field and the condensate atom is decreased for @xmath37 . 
 @xmath39 represents the energy due to non linear dispersive coupling between the position quadrature of the movable mirror and the intensity of light field where @xmath40 is the mirror - photon coupling . 
 the hamiltonian in second quantized form with the two - body interaction is given as :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the atom field operator and @xmath43 is the s - wave scattering length . using @xmath44 , we derive the bose - hubbard hamiltonian . here , @xmath45 is the wannier function and @xmath46 is the corresponding annihilation operator for the @xmath47 bosonic atom . 
 experimentally , the optical lattice depth is tuned such that time scales over which the experiment is performed is smaller than the time scales over which tunneling takes place , hence the tunneling of the atoms into neighbouring wells can be neglected in deriving the hamiltonian . 
 therefore , hamiltonian reads as :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the onsite kinetic energy of the atoms . 
 @xmath50 is the effective onsite potential energy of the atoms . 
 the last term in the above hamiltonian represents the two - body atom - atom coupling where @xmath51 represents the effective onsite atom - atom interaction energy . 
 now , we study the quantum langevin equations(qles ) of the system . 
 the qles of motion for the boson field operator @xmath52 , cavity photons @xmath18 and movable mirror ( mode ) operator @xmath23 are given as :    @xmath53    @xmath54+\eta'-\frac{\kappa}{2}b(t)+\sqrt{\kappa}b_{in}(t),\ ] ]    @xmath55    due to leakage of photons from the mirror , the cavity field is damped . 
 therefore , we have introduced @xmath56 as the cavity field damping rate . 
 also , the interaction of the cantilever with environment damps the mechanical mode with damping rate @xmath57 . during the experiment , the condensate atoms are robust and therefore the depletion of atoms is not significant . since the condensate temperature is much smaller than @xmath58 , so 
 , there is negligible coherent amplification of the condensate motion . 
 the mechanical mode is also affected by a random brownian force which has @xmath59 as zero mean value . 
 the vaccum radiation input noise is represented by @xmath60 . 
 the correlation functions for the input noise operators are given in the appendix i. the qles are linearized around the steady state as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the steady state values of cavity mode , mechanical mode and condensate density respectively . @xmath67 atoms occupy @xmath68 number of lattice sites . 
 it is assumed that all the sites of optical lattice are same , therefore @xmath69 is replaced by @xmath70 . by introducing the amplitude and phase quadratures as @xmath71 $ ] , @xmath72 $ ] , 
 @xmath73 $ ] , @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] , the linearized qles for the system are given as follows :    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 $ ] which satisfies the correlation given in the appendix i.    let us now understand how the radiation pressure cools the mechanical oscillator . 
 radiation pressure exerted on the movable mirror by the optical cavity mode forms a system which acts as another reservoir connected to the mechanical oscillator when the cavity is properly detuned . as a result , the effective temperature of the vibrational mode is the temperature between the two reservoirs i.e. , between the initial bath temperature and temperature of this effective optical reservoir . 
 this effective temperature is zero in practice . 
 hence the quantum ground state is acheived when the coupling to the initial reservoir , given by the damping rate of the movable mirror @xmath57 , is much smaller than the coupling to the effective optical reservoir . 
 this explains us that the radiation pressure coupling should be strong for significant cooling of the mechanical oscillator . 
 now , we shall see in the next sections how the different cooling techniques help in cooling the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state . 
 back - action dynamics have been realized in a diverse variety of physical systems , including those of ultracold atoms @xcite.the randomness present in the unavoidable stochastic back - action forces is due to the photon shot noise . 
 these forces arise from the radiation pressure .        in this section , 
 we evaluate effective frequency , effective damping rate and displacement spectrum for the mechanical oscillator ( mirror ) in the back - action cooling scheme . 
 also we show how the ground state cooling of the mirror is approached in this scheme . 
 the displacement spectrum in fourier space is evaluated from    @xmath93    using the correlations in fourier space given in the appendix i. therefore , the displacement spectrum in the fourier space for the movable mirror is given as :    @xmath94,\ ] ]    where @xmath95 is the thermal noise spectrum arising from the brownian motion of the mirror and @xmath96 is the radiation pressure spectrum including the quantum fluctuations of the condensate . 
 @xmath97 is the effective susceptibility of the oscillator . 
 here    @xmath98    @xmath99    where @xmath100.\ ] ]    @xmath101    where @xmath102}.\ ] ]    @xmath97 is the effective susceptibility of the resonator altered by the radiation pressure and condensate fluctuations with    @xmath103}\ ] ]    the effective mechanical susceptibility of the oscillator gives us the effective resonance frequency and effective damping rate as :    @xmath104^{1/2},\ ] ]    where    @xmath105}{x(\omega)},\ ] ]    @xmath106    [ cols=""^,^ "" , ]      in cold damping feedback scheme 
 . rest of the parameters are same as figure 13(a ) . ]    now , we characterize the steady state energy of the mirror in the cold damping feedback scheme . 
 the optimal cooling conditions can be obtained using the stability conditions which are modified in this scheme given in the appendix ii . 
 the oscillator variances represented by eqns . 
 ( [ delq ] ) and ( [ delp ] ) and the mean energy of the oscillator given by eqn . 
 ( [ energy ] ) , using the corresponding position spectrum for the cold damping case , are calculated numerically with the help of mathematica 8.0 . 
 this shows that , also using cold damping , there is no equipartition of energy i.e. , @xmath107 in general . 
 fig.13(a ) illustrates both the variances @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a function of dimensionless detuning ( @xmath110 ) for the absence of bec and three different values of condensate two - body interaction ( @xmath111 ) , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . as it can be seen from the figure , the displacement and momentum variances decrease significantly on adding bec to the system . 
 moreover , both variances decrease with the increase in condensate two - body interaction . 
 however , as @xmath115 approaches zero , oscillator variances increase drastically in the presence of bec . 
 therefore , one can infer that the presence of bec helps in cooling the mirror for smaller detunings . 
 so , in order to approach the optimal cooling conditions in cold damping scheme , the sum of these variances given by equations ( [ delq ] ) and ( [ delp ] ) is to be minimized which can be done by increasing the condensate two - body interaction . 
 the effective phonon number given by eqn . 
 ( [ neff ] ) is shown in fig.13(b ) as a function of dimensionless detuning ( @xmath110 ) for the absence of bec ( thick solid line ) and the three different values of atom - atom interaction , @xmath112(dashed line ) , @xmath113(thin solid line ) and @xmath114(dot dashed line ) . from the figure 
 , we observe that the minimum value of effective mean excitation number is reached for @xmath113 which is @xmath116 with @xmath117 . 
 although , as @xmath118 , the cavity field amplitude quadrature @xmath119 becomes insensitive to the mirror motion and @xmath120 increases considerably with increasing @xmath111 . 
 so , the ground state cooling can be approached by adding bec to the system involving cold damping feedback scheme for lower detunings . 
 hence , by varying the atom - atom interaction , one can optimize the cooling process to acheive the ground state . using cavity self - cooling scheme , 
 least value of @xmath120 is acheived in the absence of bec while using cold damping feedback technique , minimum value is obtained by adding bec to the system . 
 moreover , with bec , we are getting the least value of effective phonon number using back - action cooling scheme . 
 we have also shown the variation of effective phonon number @xmath120 as a function of @xmath121 in fig.(14 ) . 
 it clearly illustrates the fact that , in the presence of bec , the ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillator can be achieved for higher condensate two - body interaction only . 
 this sudden increase in the value of @xmath120 for very small atom - atom interaction is the consequence of the decrease in the effective mechanical damping rate of the mirror given by eqn.([gcd ] ) in this region . since in this chosen parameter regime , the second term in eqn.([gcd ] ) becomes excessively small and even negative for very small @xmath111 . 
 moreover , we have also examined that by taking @xmath122 , keeping other parameters same as before , the uncertainty principle is stratified for both displacement and momentum variances . 
 this implies that @xmath123 , therefore , energy equipartiton is satisfied . 
 however , the ground state could not be approached in this regime i.e. , we are getting @xmath124 . 
 in this paper , we have studied how the back - action cooling and cold damping feedback schemes help in cooling the mirror to its quantum ground state by using a bec confined in an optical cavity . 
 the atom - atom two body interaction can be used as a new handle to cool the quantum device in both the schemes . 
 it provides a systematic control of the system which can be altered either by using number of atoms or s - wave scattering length . 
 both the techniques show distinct displacement spectrums involving energy exchange between the different modes of the system . 
 a coherent control over the feedback parameters , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , can manipulate the displacement spectrum in the cold damping feedback scheme . in back - action cooling 
 , the least value of effective phonon number is obtained without bec whereas in cold damping , it is obtained with bec . 
 the effective temperature of the oscillator does not vary much for higher condensate two - body interaction with self - cooling . 
 also in this scheme , higher negative detuning gives lesser value of effective phonon number in the presence of bec as compared to that in the absence of bec . 
 as we compare both the schemes , the minimum value of effective phonon number is obtained using cavity self - cooling with bec . 
 we have analyzed that both the techniques help in approaching the quantum ground state of the oscillator . 
 dicrimination in the ideal cooling conditions for these schemes exhibits that back - action dynamics is more convenient in good cavity limit ( @xmath1 ) while cold damping is preferable in bad cavity limit ( @xmath0 ) .

 following correlations are satisfied by the input noise operators @xcite :    @xmath127    @xmath128    the noise operator due to the brownian motion of the mirror is given as @xmath92 $ ] which satisfies the following correlation @xcite :    @xmath129,\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the finite temperature of the bath connected to the cantilever and @xmath130 is the boltzmann constant . brownian noise is the random thermal noise which arises from the stochastic motion of the mechanical oscillator ( mirror ) . 
 it should be noted that brownian noise is non - markovian in nature . 
 the quantum brownian motion of the movable mirror gives rise to the thermal noise term in the measured phase noise spectrum of the optical field reflected from the cavity @xcite . 
 the amplitude and phase quadratures of the input noise operator satisfy the following correlations in fourier space @xcite :    @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 . 
 also in fourier space , the correlation function for the brownian noise operator is given as @xcite :    @xmath135 \delta(\omega+\omega')$ ]    the correlation of vacuum field quadrature in the fourier space is @xmath136 
 in the back - action cooling scheme , two non - trivial stability conditions for the system in the absence of bec , obtained by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion , are given as : @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 while the stability conditions , evaluated by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion , for the system in the presence of bec are as follows : @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 moreover , the routh - hurwitz criterion is equivalent to the condition by imposing all the poles of mechanical susceptibility ( @xmath153 ) in lower complex half plane . 
 hence , one gets a non - trivial modified stability condition for the cold damping case in the presence of bec as follows : @xmath154 where @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157,\ ] ] @xmath158,\ ] ] @xmath159,\ ] ] @xmath160 in the absence of bec , the stability condition for the system involving cold damping feedback can be obtained by putting all the bec parameters to be zero in eqns .

87,"in many cases , coulomb interactions in many - electron systems can be accounted for by perturbation theory  @xcite . 
 this is usually possible at sufficiently high densities where the single - particle ( kinetic - energy or band - dispersion ) contribution to the ground - state energy dominates . in lowest order , 
 interactions give rise to the hartree and exchange - interaction terms . 
 the hartree term embodies the purely electrostatic coulomb potential energy of the electrons . in a uniform system , 
 the hartree contribution is cancelled by the neutralizing background of ionic charges in the solid . 
 what remains is the exchange term , which we focus on in this work .    since their experimental realization 
 , quantum - confined systems have become attractive laboratories for the study of interacting electrons because interaction effects are enhanced in low spatial dimensions  @xcite . 
 examples include the exchange enhancement of parameters such as spin susceptibility and effective mass in quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) conduction - band electron systems  @xcite . 
 curiously , experiments on similarly confined _ valence - band _ ( hole ) states seem to indicate the absence of exchange - related renormalizations of electronic parameters  @xcite . here 
 we reveal a possible origin of this suppression of interaction effects in quasi-2d hole systems : the high effective spin associated with valence - band states . 
 peculiar coulombic effects arising from the spin-3/2 character of holes have previously been noted for bulk semiconductors . 
 @xcite more recent theoretical studies have focused also on quasi-2d hole gases . @xcite 
 our results provide new insight into the effect of valence - band mixing on physical properties of confined holes , and the formalism developed here can also form the basis for further detailed studies of interaction phenomena in experimentally realized quasi-2d hole systems . 
 the multi - band envelope function approach to electron states in crystalline solids implies that eigenstates are ( in principle , infinite - dimensional ) spinors  @xcite which affect the matrix elements describing physical processes in important ways . for an @xmath0-fold degenerate band 
 , we may often restrict ourselves to @xmath0 spinors . 
 the states in the lowest conduction band are usually non - degenerate , except for spin , so that the spinor structure may often be ignored . 
 a nontrivial example are hole states in the topmost valence band of common semiconductors such as si , ge , gaas , inas , and cdte . 
 the _ bulk _ valence band in these materials is four - fold degenerate at the band edge , corresponding to an effective spin 3/2 . 
 away from the band edge , the dispersion splits into the doubly degenerate heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands . in quasi-2d systems , the quantum - well confinement results in an energy splitting between hh and lh bands such that the subbands are only two - fold degenerate , even at the subband edge with in - plane wave vector @xmath1 . 
 nevertheless , states in these subbands need to be described by four - spinors and , except at @xmath2 , these are never pure hhs or lhs . 
 figure  [ fig : dispersions ] shows the subbands obtained for a hard - wall confinement of holes within the axial approximation for three semiconductor materials . 
 the nontrivial physics arises due to the fact that the degeneracy of the subbands at any fixed value of energy and wave vector @xmath3 is lower than the number of spinors needed to describe the dynamics of the bloch waves . 
 similar physics applies also to , e.g. , 2d electron systems with rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling . 
 @xcite however , it was found that the exchange energy of such systems deviates only marginally from that of a simple 2d electron gas  @xcite , while the properties of collective excitations can be more strongly affected by so coupling  @xcite .    as a reference for our discussion below , we briefly review the textbook problem  @xcite of the exchange energy per particle for a 2d electron gas with zero thickness perpendicular to the 2d plane , giving  @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the number of electrons , @xmath6 is the coulomb - interaction constant , @xmath7 is the electron sheet density , and @xmath8 denotes the fermi wave vector . 
 this result is based on the following assumptions . 
 ( i ) the in - plane orbital motion is fully characterized by plane waves . 
 ( ii ) we have a two - fold spin degeneracy of the energy eigenstates , implying that all energy eigenstates can simultaneously be chosen as eigenstates of spin projection on a fixed axis . 
 the latter manifests itself in the fact that only interactions between particles with the same spin projections contribute to the exchange energy . 
 we emphasize these well - known points because we find below that these assumptions are not applicable for quasi-2d hole systems .    using the same assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) above 
 , one can evaluate the exchange energy for a _ 
 quasi_-2d electron gas in the lowest subband of a quantum well with hard - wall confinement . 
 here , @xmath9 depends also on the well width @xmath10 and can be written as  @xcite @xmath11 the universal function @xmath12 was expressed in ref . 
 in terms of a taylor expansion in its argument . in the following , we will refer to eq . 
 ( [ eq : xfinwidth ] ) as the effective - mass approximation ( ema ) to the exchange energy . 
 we note that the exchange energy in quasi-2d systems is generally reduced with increasing quantum - well width @xmath10 . 
 frequently the exchange energy is expressed in terms of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath13 , which in 2d is the ratio between the coulomb energy @xmath14 and the kinetic energy @xmath15 , assuming a _ parabolic _ dispersion @xmath16 with effective mass @xmath17 . in the current work , 
 we avoid using the parameter @xmath18 , the reason being that the systems we study here do not have a simple parabolic energy dispersion .    using the numerically calculated multi - spinor envelope functions for quasi-2d hole systems , we evaluate their exchange energy and find it to deviate from the ema expression ( [ eq : xfinwidth ] ) . as fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] shows , the ema behavior is exhibited in the low - density , small - width limit where the system s states are essentially hh - like  @xcite . 
 however , at larger densities , even with still only the lowest quasi-2d subband occupied , the character of the wave functions becomes mixed , with eventually the hh and lh components having almost equal weight ( see fig . 
 [ fig : hhcont ] and ref .  ) . 
 the exchange energy turns out to be suppressed compared to the ema value as soon as the contributions from lh components become significant . 
 this can be seen from fig . 
 [ fig : hhcont ] in conjunction with fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] . 
 we obtain good agreement between the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 at large densities and an analytical expression obtained within a simplified model with equally distributed hh and lh amplitudes . 
 this supports our hypothesis that the suppression of exchange effects in quasi-2d hole systems arises as a consequence of valence - band mixing .    in the remainder of this paper , we provide details of the calculations and further information to illustrate our conclusions . 
 the basic formalism for calculating the exchange energy of quasi-2d systems is described in sec . 
 [ sec : formalism ] . in sec . 
 [ sec:2delectrons ] , we review known results for quasi-2d spin-1/2 electron systems that provide a benchmark for comparison with analogous hole systems . 
 the formalism for calculating the exchange energy of spin-3/2 quasi-2d hole systems and a discussion of the obtained results are given in sec . 
 [ sec:2dholes ] . 
 the conclusions of our work are summarized in the final sec . 
 [ sec : conc ] . 
 in its most general form , the many - body hamiltonian of interacting band electrons reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the system volume ( i.e. , area in the 2d case ) , and the operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) annihilate ( create ) an electron with wave vector @xmath3 . 
 note that in the presence of so interaction the spin quantum number is , by itself , not a good quantum number . 
 thus @xmath0 is a common index for the orbital motion in a ( sub)band and the spin degree of freedom . 
 @xcite in the following , we focus on the case of a quantum - well - confined system , hence the indices @xmath23 are labeling quasi-2d subbands and @xmath24 is a 2d vector . 
 we use the jellium model and therefore the @xmath25 component of the interaction is not present , as it cancels with the external potential due to the homogeneous positive - charge background that ensures charge neutrality . treating the interaction part of the hamiltonian in first - order perturbation theory 
 gives the following correction to the expectation value of the energy of the system : @xmath26{@{}>{\displaystyle}r@ { } }      e_\mathrm{x } = -\frac{1}{2 a }      \sum_{n_i , { { \bm{\mathrm{k } } } } , { { \bm{\mathrm{k } } } } ' , { { \bm{\mathrm{q}}}}\ne 0 } \hspace{-0.6em }      v^{n_1 n_2}_{n_3 n_4}({{\bm{\mathrm{k } } } } , { { \bm{\mathrm{k } } } } ' , { { \bm{\mathrm{q } } } } )      \ ; \langle \hat{c}_{n_1{{\bm{\mathrm{k}}}}+{{\bm{\mathrm{q}}}}}^\dagger \hat{c}_{n_3{{\bm{\mathrm{k}}}}'}\rangle_0      \\ { } \times      \langle \hat{c}_{n_2{{\bm{\mathrm{k}}}}'- { { \bm{\mathrm{q}}}}}^\dagger \hat{c}_{n_4{{\bm{\mathrm{k}}}}}\rangle_0\ , ,    \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath27 indicates the expectation value with respect to the equilibrium density matrix of the non - interacting system . 
 the correction  ( [ eq : ex-1 ] ) is the exchange contribution to the energy . 
 we now notice that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fermi function . transforming the sums over wave vectors into integrals and using the relation above , 
 the exchange energy reads @xmath30 where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath31 . as a side remark 
 we can define the fock self - energy as @xmath32    the exchange energy , eq . 
 ( [ eq : ex ] ) , is an an extensive quantity . 
 it is customary to present the exchange energy per particle as a related intensive quantity ( @xmath33 ) ,    @xmath34    finally we notice that , in the zero - temperature limit considered here , the fermi function becomes @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the heavyside step function and @xmath37 the fermi energy . 
 calculation of the quantities given in eqs . 
 ( [ eq : selfenergy])([eq : xchangepp1 ] ) requires explicit knowledge of the interaction matrix elements . 
 we now discuss their most general form for a quasi-2d system . 
 the eigenfunctions of the multi - band envelope - function hamiltonian describing a quasi-2d system take the generic form  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the coordinate in the 2d plane , @xmath3 the in - plane wave vector , and @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41th spinor component of the envelope function for the @xmath0th subband in the basis of bulk band - edge bloch functions @xmath42 . using the general expression ( [ eq : efagen ] ) for the electron states , the coulomb matrix elements are given by @xmath43 with form factors    @xmath44    that take into account the finite quantum - well width as well as the spinor structure of quasi-2d states . more specifically 
 , we obtain for the exchange matrix elements    [ eq : xgen_me ] @xmath45 with form factors @xmath46    equation ( [ eq : xchangepp ] ) combined with eqs . 
 ( [ eq : xgen ] ) and ( [ eq : xgenff ] ) provides the most general expression for the exchange energy of a quasi-2d many - particle system in a multiband envelope - function formulation . 
 we would like to make the following remarks concerning eq . 
 ( [ eq : xgen_me ] ) . 
 ( i ) the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) integration probes the overlap between spinor components for the same spinor index @xmath41 ( @xmath49 ) ; in the end we sum over @xmath41 and @xmath49 . 
 in contrast to the usual textbook case , terms with @xmath41 different from @xmath49 generally contribute to the exchange energy . 
 ( ii ) the exchange matrix elements for quasi-2d systems are reduced as compared with the corresponding quantities for a strictly-2d system because @xmath50 . 
 ( iii ) we note the symmetries @xmath51 which have been pointed out in a related context before [ see eq . 
 ( 13 ) in ref .  ] . 
 the first relation in eq.([eq : form - sym ] ) implies that the exchange matrix elements ( [ eq : xgen ] ) are real @xmath52 the second relation in eq . 
 ( [ eq : form - sym ] ) implies the symmetry @xmath53 , which can be useful to aid efficient numerical computation of eq . 
 ( [ eq : xchangepp ] ) . 
 ( iv ) finally , we point out that the generalized exchange matrix elements ( [ eq : xgen_me ] ) can give interesting physics for a nontrivial orbital dynamics that can be expressed in spinor form ( as is the case for , e.g. , graphene ) , for a nontrivial @xmath3 dependent spin texture ( as is the case for , e.g. , systems with rashba so coupling ) , as well as for the most general case of coupled multiband dynamics with so coupling , where spin and orbital motion are not separable ( as is the case for , e.g. , quasi-2d hole systems ) .      in the following , 
 we employ the _ axial aproximation _ , where the spinor components @xmath54 satisfy @xmath55 here we have expressed the 2d wave vector @xmath3 in polar coordinates , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the @xmath47 projection of total angular momentum associated with the band edge bloch function @xmath58 . 
 the axial approximation reflects the fact that it is often possible to group the basis spinors @xmath59 into degenerate multiplets associated with a total angular momentum @xmath60 and @xmath47 projections @xmath57 . within the axial approximation 
 , we find @xmath61 with radial form factors    @xmath62    separating out the most important effect of the angular dependencies , we rewrite eq . 
 ( [ eq : xchmat ] ) as follows : @xmath63      \mathcal{a}^{(\nu , \nu')}_{n ' k ' , n k }      \left(\theta ' - \theta\right)\right\ } \quad .\ ] ] from the expression ( [ eq : exchange ] ) for the coulomb - interaction exchange matrix elements , the effect of a nontrivial spinor structure of the quasi-2d wave function becomes apparent . 
 the first term on the r.h.s .  of eq . 
 ( [ eq : exchange ] ) represents the usual form - factor renormalization of the exchange energy in a 2d system  @xcite . 
 the second term only contributes for spinor wave functions with more than a single nonvanishing component .    inserting ( [ eq : exchange ] ) into the expressions for the self - energy correction due to exchange 
 eventually yields    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the fermi wave vector of subband @xmath0 , and the form factors become @xmath66    assuming we have @xmath67 spin - resolved subbands occupied , this can be rephrased in the `` dimensionless '' form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a density - related wave vector that coincides with the fermi wave vector of a 2d electron system with @xmath67-fold ( spin-)degenerate eigenenergies .      to calculate the form factors @xmath71 , the explicit form of the spinor functions @xmath72 
 is needed . 
 the subband @xmath73 method  @xcite yields these as superpositions of subband - edge states , @xmath74 with expansion coefficients @xmath75 . 
 the radial form factors are then given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 for a hard - wall confinement of width @xmath10 , one has @xmath79 with @xmath80 , independent of the spinor index @xmath41 . in this case , the form factors ( [ eq:2ndff ] ) can be evaluated explicitly , @xcite giving ( with @xmath81 ) @xmath82 { \mathrm{e}}^{-s }      - 1 - ( -1)^{m_1+m_2+m_3+m_4}\right\ } }    { [ ( m_2-m_3)^2 \pi^2+s^2 ] [ ( m_2+m_3)^2 \pi^2+s^2 ]     [ ( m_1-m_4)^2 \pi^2+s^2 ] [ ( m_1+m_4)^2 \pi^2+s^2 ] }      \nonumber\\[1ex ]     & & { } + \frac{s}{(m_2-m_3)^2\pi^2+s^2 }     \left(\delta_{m_1-m_2+m_3-m_4,0 } + \delta_{m_1+m_2-m_3-m_4,0 }       - \delta_{m_1-m_2+m_3+m_4,0 } - \delta_{m_1+m_2-m_3+m_4,0 } \right )     \nonumber\\[1ex ]     & & { } + \frac{s}{(m_2+m_3)^2\pi^2+s^2 }     \left(\delta_{m_1-m_2-m_3+m_4,0 } - \delta_{m_1+m_2+m_3-m_4,0 }       - \delta_{m_1-m_2-m_3-m_4,0}\right)~ ,   \end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath83 denotes the kronecker symbol . 
 note that eq.([eq : hw_ff ] ) implies that @xmath84 vanishes if @xmath85 is odd . 
 to make connections with previous results , we apply the general formalism described in the previous section to a 2d electron system whose transverse density profile is a delta function in @xmath47 . in this case , only @xmath86 from eq . 
 ( [ eq : hw_ff ] ) is relevant . 
 the form factor ( [ eq : formf ] ) is then only a function of @xmath87 , and its explicit expression depends on the particular type of electron system . 
 for example , in a @xmath67-component system modeled within the ema , we can use the component - related quantum number as the band label . 
 hence , @xmath88 independent of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , yielding @xmath91 and the result @xmath92 which specializes to the expression ( [ eq : xideal ] ) for a spin-1/2 system where @xmath93 . 
 in contrast , if the 2d electrons are subject to rashba so coupling  @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 measures the strength of the rashba so coupling , the fermi surface splits into two circles with radii @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the density imbalance between the two fermi seas . 
 we find    @xmath98    thus @xmath99    the exchange energy is then the sum of intra - band and inter - band contributions @xmath100 \quad , \ ] ] with    @xmath101    and    @xmath102    \quad .\ ] ]    here @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively , as defined in ref .  . 
 the term in square brackets in eq.([eq : rash_ex ] ) expresses the correction caused by rashba so coupling to the simple exchange energy @xmath105 of a 2d electron gas with zero width . 
 explicit calculation shows that @xmath106 for any value of @xmath107 , i.e. , the presence of rashba so coupling very slightly enhances ( the magnitude of ) the exchange energy of the 2d electron gas . 
 @xcite ( see fig .  3 of ref .   for a clear illustration . ) 
 note that the inequality in eq . 
 ( [ eq : exchrashba ] ) holds for parabolic bands with any values of the effective mass and rashba so - coupling strength . 
 the rather small magnitude of this effect is due to a subtle interplay between the intra - band and inter - band contributions for the special case of rashba so coupling and does not hold for arbitrary types of so coupling . 
 @xcite      when a quasi-2d spin-1/2 system without so coupling is confined by a hard - wall potential of width @xmath10 , the form factors @xmath108 are given by eq.([eq : kdotpff ] ) with @xmath109 in the ema case appropriate for electron systems , using again the spin projection as band label , we have @xmath110 . 
 this yields the result ( [ eq : xfinwidth ] ) , shown as the blue dashed curve in fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] . the width - dependent function @xmath111 can be expressed as a taylor series    [ eq : ema - expand ] @xmath112 with coefficients    @xmath113    this taylor expansion is quickly convergent . for an error of less than @xmath114% , going up to @xmath115 is sufficient to describe quasi-2d systems within the density range @xmath116 , where only the lowest subband is occupied . 
 we have calculated the exchange contribution to the ground state energy of quasi-2d hole systems , assuming the common case that the density is such that only the lowest hh - like band is occupied . 
 @xmath117 for a 15-nm - wide quantum well . 
 density estimates for real samples will have to be based on a more accurate , self - consistent modelling of the confining potential . ] 
 the quantum - well growth direction is assumed to be parallel to the [ 001 ] crystallographic axis , and we considered three different host materials : gaas , inas , and cdte .    we adopt the 4@xmath1184 luttinger model  @xcite , including a potential @xmath119 that models the confinement in @xmath47-direction . to be specific , we assume infinitely high barriers at @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with @xmath10 the width of the quantum well . using the eigenstates for spin projection perpendicular to the 2d plane as basis states such that @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , the luttinger hamiltonian for @xmath125 $ ] is given in matrix representation by @xmath126 where    @xmath127 .

 ( [ eq : maxial ] ) [ the one proportional to @xmath132 is generally small , it is often neglected in the matrix element @xmath133 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : luttham ] ) . 
 this constitutes the axial approximation  @xcite that we also adopt here . as can be seen from eq . 
 ( [ eq : luttham ] ) , @xmath134 is diagonal for @xmath135 , which implies that the corresponding eigenstates are of purely hh or lh character . 
 we utilize the subband @xmath136 theory  @xcite , described in sec . 
 [ sec : subkdotp ] above , to numerically solve the multi - band schrdinger equation for the confined valence - band states . using this method , the subband dispersions @xmath137 and the coefficients @xmath138 from eq . 
 ( [ eq : kdotpexp ] ) are obtained . 
 we include as many basis functions as are necessary to ensure accuracy of the lowest few subband dispersions . 
 [ fig : dispersions ] shows the quasi-2d subbands obtained for cdte , gaas , and inas . 
 the eigenspinors corresponding to states in the lowest doubly degenerate quasi-2d hole subband are used to determine the radial form factors from eq . 
 ( [ eq : kdotpff ] ) , with analytical expressions for the bound - state form factors ( [ eq:2ndff ] ) given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : hw_ff ] ) . using the result as input for eqs . 
 ( [ eq:2dxchange ] ) and ( [ eq : formf ] ) , the exchange energy of the quasi-2d hole system can be calculated . a modified quadrature method @xcite 
 was applied to treat the singularity in the integrand of eq . 
 ( [ eq:2dxchange ] ) . 
 in the zero - width limit , only a single pair of degenerate 2d hole subbands exist with eigenstates that are of purely hh character , i.e. , only the spinor entries related to the @xmath139 spin projection quantum numbers are nonzero . 
 this situation is analogous to the ema - based description of a spin-1/2 2d electron system . 
 for example , using the representation where the two bands are related to eigenstates @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we have no inter - band contribution to the exchange energy , and the intra - band contribution yields eq . 
 ( [ eq : xideal ] ) .      in real quasi-2d hole systems , 
 the states at finite in - plane momentum are not anymore eigenstates of spin projection perpendicular to the 2d plane  @xcite . 
 in fact , in the limit of large kinetic energy of the in - plane motion , the spinors have approximately equal admixture of hh and lh components . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : hhcont ] . in this limit 
 , we can approximate the true spin-3/2 spinor wave functions from the two degenerate lowest subbands by assuming them to be of the form   and satisfactorily approximates the numerically found spinor patterns . ] 
 @xmath142/\sqrt{d}$ ] and @xmath143/\sqrt{d}$ ] . 
 then we can use the formalism based on eqs . 
 ( [ eq:2dxchange ] ) and ( [ eq : formf ] ) to estimate the exchange energy in such a system . 
 we find for this fully hh - lh - mixed case    @xmath144    with @xmath145 given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : phi_rel ] ) . 
 the resulting width dependence of the exchange energy is shown as the orange dashed curve in fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] . similar to eq.([eq : ema - expand ] ) we can perform the taylor expansion @xmath146 with expansion coefficients    @xmath147    to describe quasi-2d hole systems within the density range , where only the lowest subband is occupied , and with an error of less than 10% , it is sufficient to go up to @xmath148 . 
 the variation of the exchange energy as a function of fermi wave vector and quantum - well width is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] . in the low - density , small - width limit 
 , the curve coincides with the plot of the expression ( [ eq : xfinwidth ] ) obtained for the ema quasi-2d system . 
 in contrast , the fully mixed case ( [ eq : fullmix ] ) provides a very good description in the limit of large densities . the small deviation that persists in the asymptotic limit arises due to our assumption of a single sine - wave contribution to the hole bound state in the full - mixing model considered above .    to further bolster our argument that hh - lh mixing is the origin of exchange - energy suppression in quasi-2d hole systems , we have calculated the hh character @xmath149 of the states at the fermi energy by integrating the combined probability densities for the @xmath139 spin projection entries in the corresponding four - spinor wave function . in terms of the latter s expression as a superposition of states at @xmath135 [ see eq . 
 ( [ eq : kdotpexp ] ) ] , we find @xmath150 the results for gaas , inas , and cdte are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : hhcont ] . 
 comparison with fig . 
 [ fig : reduction2 ] shows that the deviation from the behavior expected for a simple quasi-2d spin-1/2 electron system occurs when the hole states at the fermi energy are no longer of purely hh character . 
 we have calculated the exchange - energy contribution to the total energy of hard - wall - confined quasi-2d hole systems when only the lowest subband is occupied . even though there is only a double degeneracy of states in this band , the wave functions are four - spinors associated with the intrinsic spin-3/2 degree of freedom for valence - band states . at sufficiently low densities and/or small quantum - well widths when the quasi-2d hole states are almost purely heavy - hole - like , the behavior resembles that of ordinary ( spin-1/2 ) quasi-2d electron systems . however , as soon as the light - hole admixture in the spinors becomes appreciable , the exchange energy turns out to be suppressed . 
 performing calculations for the specific case of a hard - wall confinement enabled us to obtain analytical expressions for relevant limiting cases and compare these with the numerically calculated results for the exchange energy of quasi-2d hole systems . 
 however , the general formalism to calculate the exchange energy in confined multi - band systems that is developed in this work can be readily adapted to more accurate descriptions  @xcite of hole quantum wells . 
 our results provide strong evidence that the suppression of exchange effects will be a general feature of any situation where hh - lh mixing is substantial , and we therefore propose this mechanism as the basic explanation of an experimentally observed absence of exchange renormalizations in quasi-2d hole systems  @xcite . depending on sample details , this behavior may occur in different parameter regimes , e.g. , while hh - lh mixing is strong for larger densities for a hard - wall confinement , the fully mixed regime occurs at _ low _ densities for a density - dependent triangular potential realized in single heterojunctions . 
 further studies are needed to provide a basis for accurate comparisons with experimental data , as the actual shape of the confinement potential and the ( here neglected ) anisotropy of the dispersion may influence the exact functional dependence of the exchange energy on characteristic system parameters such as the 2d - hole sheet density .

88,"at present intermittency @xcite seems to be a well - founded fact observed in high - energy multiparticle production @xcite . 
 this phenomenon , expressing as the power - law behavior ,    @xmath2    of the @xmath3-order normalized scaled factorial moments ( sfm ) ,    @xmath4}\rangle } { \langle n_m \rangle ^q } \label{f}\ ] ]    ( `` vertical '' analysis @xcite@xcite ) , identifies dynamical fluctuations . here 
 @xmath5}$ ] is the @xmath3th power factorial multinomial , @xmath6 , with multiplicity @xmath7 in the @xmath8th bin from @xmath9 ones , into which the space of the particles produced are divided . 
 average is taken over all events . 
 the intermittency indexes , @xmath10 , obtained via ( [ fi ] ) are shown @xcite to be related to the fractal codimensions @xmath11 @xcite ,    @xmath12    and correspondingly reflects the inner structure of fluctuations representing monofractal patterns with the unique @xmath11 , or multifractal ones with the hierarchy @xmath13 .    applied to multihadron production processes , formation of such geometrical structures 
 are pointed out @xcite to be a manifestation of one of two possible mechanisms . 
 the first one , leading to the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath11 , is that one connects @xcite with self - similar cascade , rather a `` non - thermal '' ( non - equilibrium ) phase transition during the cascade than particle creation within one phase , e.g. hadronic @xcite . 
 the second scenario assumed at monofractality , is associated with thermal transition @xcite , e.g. from a quark - gluon plasma expected to be reached in central collisions of ( ultra)relativistic nuclei @xcite . 
 so study of intermittency decodes through fractality the geometrical and then thermodynamical features of high - energy multiparticle production . 
 note that the random cascading models being widely used as suitable to describe such processes ( e.g. , negative binomial distribution ) @xcite , lead in the most general form to the scaling ( [ fi ] ) @xcite , though they seem to be problematic to reproduce intermittency observed @xcite . in general , the observations are still far from the qualitative explanation using existed particle - production codes , and origin of intermittency / fractality is a matter of debates @xcite . 
 meanwhile , intermittency turns out to be very sensitive to the hadronic phase @xcite . 
 since the interpretation is mostly done in the approach based on the parton cascade models , it is rather difficult to explain the fact that partonic local fluctuations survive the hadronization process @xcite . in this context 
 it is noticeable that `` universality '' of multihadron production in different type of reactions ( from lepton - hadron to nucleus - nucleus ) @xcite can be just a reflection of hadronization dynamics properties @xcite . 
 thus , search for dynamical fluctuations and its possible treatment in `` soft '' process terms attracts considerable interest in reactions at intermediate energies . 
 important features of intermittency systematics behavior found in high - energy nuclear interactions @xcite-@xcite are also already found to be manifested at relativistic energies . besides purely hadronic model calculations showing intermittent structure due to the random cascade @xcite , enhancement of intermittency with beam energy decrease @xcite and weakening of the effect with increase complexity of reaction @xcite are obtained . 
 recently , processes with low average multiplicity was discussed @xcite to dominate in the fractional sfm analysis . 
 the present paper deals with the study of the data obtained after processing the pictures of the 2 m streamer chamber skm-200 @xcite equipped with a copper target . 
 the chamber was installed in a 0.8 t magnetic field and it was exposed to the 4.5  @xmath0 gev@xmath14 @xmath15c beam at the jinr synchrophasotron ( dubna ) . in data taking , 
 the central collision trigger was used : the chamber was started if there were no charged particles with momenta larger than 3 gev@xmath14 in a forward cone of 2.4@xmath16 . 
 details of the set - up design and data reduction procedure are described elsewhere @xcite . 
 systematic errors related to the trigger effects , low energy pion and proton detection , the admixture of electrons etc . have been considered in detail earlier @xcite and the total contribution does not exceed @xmath17 . 
 the scanning and handling of the film data were carried out on special scanning tables of the lebedev physical institute ( moscow ) , using the method elaborated in ref . 
 the average measurement error in the momentum @xmath18 was about @xmath19 , and that in the polar angle measurements was @xmath20 . to search for dynamical fluctuations the charged particles in the pseudorapidity ( @xmath21 ) region @xmath22 ( in the target rest - frame ) 
 were used , in which the angular measurement accuracy was not larger than 0.1 in the @xmath23-units . 
 the samples of 305 c  cu events , which meet the above centrality criterion , have been selected with the average multiplicity of @xmath24 in the @xmath25 under consideration . 
 earlier we have already analyzed fluctuations in the data presented and existence of non - statistical ( dynamical ) fluctuations was shown @xcite within intermittency approach and using multifractal analysis @xcite . 
 it is noteworthy that only applying the methods with statistical background suppression allowed dynamical nature of the fluctuations to be manifested , while the comparison between data and completely uncorrelated particle - production simulation fails to do that @xcite . 
 it is significant in sense of the above discussed `` hadronic origin '' of the intermittency that analogous observation have been done at ultra - relativistic energies @xcite ( see also ref . 
 @xcite ) . 
 the study @xcite also showed multifractality of the particle spectra along with multiparticle character of the fluctuations being important to choice of the real particle - production model , as discussed . 
 multifractality have been also observed at ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions but obliged mainly to the two - particle correlations @xcite . 
 note that multiparticle contribution to the very - short - range correlations are directly observed in our data using the method of factorial cumulants @xcite as found in hadronic interactions recently @xcite .    before presenting the results , two important technical remarks should be made . 
 first of all , in the previous investigations we have used `` horizontal '' analysis of the sfm taking into account the non - flat shape of the one - particle pseudorapidity distribution @xmath26 to minimize the difference from `` vertical '' normalization ( [ f ] ) @xcite . note that , though the `` corrected '' sfm were widely applied to analysis ( in particular , at relatively small multiplicities ) it implies the fluctuations to be bin - independent ( the sum of the quotient in ( [ f ] ) transforms into the fraction of independent sums , @xmath27}\rangle/\sum_{m=1}^{m}\langle n_m \rangle ^q$ ] ) that is , generally , a non - trivial assumption @xcite . in our data 
 the slopes of the vertically - normalized moments are significantly greater the corrected ones at @xmath28 @xcite , while they coincides in collisions of ultra - relativistic ions @xcite .    to overcome the problem and , moreover , to compare the results observed in different experiments a new transformed variable ,    @xmath29    have been introduced @xcite , so that @xmath30 is uniformly distributed in the [ 0;1 ] interval ( @xmath31 ) . 
 due to the scale properties of the variables ( [ nv ] ) , the one - particle spectrum stretches in its central region ( not significantly changing at the @xmath32-edges ) , eliminating losses from bin - splitting and , thus , allowing to observe higher - order moments . 
 another remark regards to the biased estimator of the sfm normalization , being the @xmath3-particle density function for uncorrelated production of particles in assumption of infinite statistics @xcite . 
 this sensitively influence the scaling law ( [ fi ] ) for small bins . 
 note that a flattening of the moments for @xmath33 is expected to be a reflection of the attainment of the correlation length @xcite . 
 really , measured sfm go to zero as the bin size aspires to the experimental resolution @xcite , or much before because of the statistics limitations ( `` empty bin effect '' @xcite ) . 
 recently , the modification of the method of the sfm have been proposed @xcite to remove the bias in the normalization , and then the bias - free moments are defined to be , e.g. at `` vertical '' analysis ,    @xmath34}\rangle } { n_m^{[q]}}\ ; , \label{fb}\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the number of particles in the @xmath8th bin in all @xmath36 events , @xmath37 . 
 the property of the `` vertical '' and `` horizontal '' analysis to give the same results if the scaled variables ( [ nv ] ) are used ( @xmath38 ) seems to be also valid for the definition ( [ fb ] ) . 
 in fig.1 we show the log - log plots of the modified sfm ( [ fb ] ) vs. number of bins of the space of `` pseudorapidity '' ( [ nv ] ) . 
 though by illustration reasons the dependencies are given only for some orders , viz . 
 @xmath39 , they reflect the common peculiarities to be noticed . from the plots and the values of @xmath10 ( see table ) one can conclude that , besides considerable intermittent behavior , pronounced up to higher orders , there are the different power - like dependences in different intervals . since at low orders ( @xmath40 ) this expresses as two sharply differed slopes : the values at @xmath41 are about seven times less than ones at @xmath42 , this effect grows weak at @xmath43 and @xmath44 . 
 it is visible also that as the order increase an additional intermittent structure manifests at the range of small bins , but does nt in fact survive when five and more particles are required to fill the bin and effect of small statistics becomes sizeable . 
 however , regardless to the irregularities in the @xmath9-dependence of the sfm , @xmath45 increase with the order up to higher moments . 
 moreover , in the @xmath9-interval of [ 7;17 ] and especially at @xmath46 strong intermittency is seen . 
 it should be noted that the irregular behavior of the sfm was also observed in our previous investigation @xcite , but using of the `` ordinary '' pseudorapidity variable strongly limited the order of the moment . transforming @xmath47-spectra into the uniform ones made this effect more pronounced and allowed to consider the sfm of high orders , where a new sub - structure is revealed . 
 note that strongly non - linear increasing of the log - log plots as presented have been observed in different interactions , from lepton - hadron to heavy ion collisions @xcite , particularly at high - orders of the moments ( e.g. @xcite ) and/or at multidimensional analysis @xcite . 
 as discussed , intermittency index , or rather codimension ( [ d ] ) dependence on @xmath3-order gives an information on the possible particle - production scenario . 
 in fig.2 we demonstrate @xmath11 as a function of @xmath3 for different @xmath9-intervals , within which a linear fit of the sfm plots ( fig.1 ) is valid ; the corresponding @xmath10-values are shown in the table . from the behavior of the @xmath11 obtained one can definitely conclude that very multifractal structure ( @xmath48 ) of multiparticle production is revealed , independent of the interval of @xmath9 considered ; no evidence for monofractality , and then for a second - order phase transition is seen . let us to mention that decrease of the @xmath11 at high order is , in our opinion , connected with relatively small number of particles per event . 
 meantime , no considerable difference are obtained for some @xmath9-intervals , namely for the couples of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 . 
 the multifractality , as noted above , lends support to find the condition for the non - thermal phase , not characterized by a thermodynamical behavior @xcite . as signal of the transition to this phase the existence of a minimum of the function    @xmath53    at a certain `` critical '' value of @xmath54 
 is required . 
 in such a `` spin - glass '' phase the events are dominated by a few clots in projected distributions , while the `` normal '' phase is represented by the events with a bulk of peaks and holes @xcite . the minimum of eq . 
 ( [ l ] ) , as shown @xcite , may be a manifestation of the fact that these two different phase mixed . 
 moreover , the phase transition can accompany ( or occur inside ) the branching process @xcite . 
 in fig.3 the @xmath55 are displayed as function of the @xmath3-order for different @xmath9-intervals with considerably distinguished @xmath11 ( see fig.2 ) . 
 a clear minimum at @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are seen , whilst the fits at @xmath56 do not exhibit such a feature . in our opinion 
 , this is very intrinsic finding . 
 indeed , while sensitive behavior of the sfm in the region of @xmath57 are observing right up to eighth order ( fig.1 and the table ) such a sharp difference of the dependence of @xmath55 may be a signal of a non - trivial dynamical effect - intervals . ] . referring to the non - thermal phase transition interpretation @xcite 
 one should conclude that fits at different @xmath9-intervals lead to different cases of the intermittency : `` weak '' intermittency for monotone function ( [ l ] ) ( large @xmath58 ) and `` stronger '' intermittency when minimum is reached at @xmath43 or @xmath44 . the stronger intermittency is related to the so - called `` peak transition '' , i.e. transition at positive index @xmath58 , and the weak case contains the absence of the transition also . 
 in our view , such an ambiguity is related to the cascade mechanism description that includes many steps irregardless to _ the change of the regime of particle production at different bin - averaging scales_. this is , that apparently brings indetermination in treating of the intermittency observations e.g. in @xmath59-annihilation @xcite and , meanwhile , being manifesting in our data is an extra proof of hadronic nature of intermittency observed @xcite . 
 noteworthily , only using of higher - order moments makes clear the hint to the non - thermal transition found earlier slightly visible up to fifth order @xcite . whether the minimum is taken place , the low-@xmath60 effect in the intermittency manifested at hadronic interactions @xcite leads to a clear minimum confirming responsible of hadronization for the effect of intermittency @xcite . 
 the @xmath60 range for the stronger intermittency in our case was observed to be of 0.350.45 gev/@xmath1 like one have been already found searching for the maximum fluctuations @xcite . 
 it should be stressed also that since the minimum of the @xmath55 ( [ l ] ) corresponds @xcite to zeros of the fractal spectra , the system `` frozen '' at this point is no longer self - averaging and introducing of new observables is needed @xcite .    the shown importance of the cascade approach in the multiparticle production and the abovementioned underlying of these processes to describe the hadronization attracts considerable interest to compare the predictions with the observations . 
 let us to limit oneself what have been earlier studied related to the sfm method , viz . 
 negative binomial distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) , gaussian approximation @xcite and scale - invariant mass - splitting branching model @xcite . 
 if the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) is valid then the sfm are determined by the recurrence relation    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is one of two nbd parameters should be independent of the @xmath63 . 
 the bin dependence of @xmath62 expected from the intermittent rise at @xmath64 ( see table ) is a reflection of the instability of the nbd @xcite . besides , the nbd is a good fit of the data in the central @xmath23-region only , and does not describe the `` tails '' of the multiplicity spectra , for which it transforms into the @xmath65-distribution being stable @xcite . in the previous ref . 
 @xcite we have shown that at the values of @xmath10 closed to the experimentally obtained ones , the absolute values of the sfm approach each other when the shape of the @xmath23-spectra is accounted for . from this observation and the noted `` central property '' of the nbd the satisfactory agreement of the moments based on ( [ nbd ] ) with the experimentally measured ones in the `` flat '' spectra over the scaled variable ( [ nv ] ) have been predicted . 
 this is a fact well seen now from fig . 
 1 ( @xmath66 for the @xmath67 are less than one standard deviation in all the @xmath9-regions ) , may be excluding the case of @xmath68 ( e.g. @xmath69 at @xmath52 ) . 
 meanwhile , the table shows that the nbd calculated slopes @xmath10 yield the values markedly distinguished from the observed ones in the stronger intermittency case with possible non - thermal phase transition ( @xmath49 , @xmath70 ) , and trend to coincide each other at weak intermittency . in our opinion 
 , this is because of input two - particle character of @xmath62 calculated from ( [ nbd ] ) : flattening of the nbd prediction with @xmath3 increase is visible at @xmath71 ( fig . 
 such a difficult meat when the nbd is applied to the intermittency search makes it problematic to describe the data . 
 let us note that invalidity of the interpretation of multiparticle production at high energies in the nbd terms was also showed recently @xcite . 
 the gaussian ( `` log - normal '' ) approximation ( ga ) predicts the relations for the slopes @xmath10 to be defined as @xcite    @xmath72    in figs . 2 and 3 we show the ga predictions for the @xmath11 ( [ d ] ) and @xmath55 ( [ l ] ) using the @xmath73-indexes at @xmath74 only . 
 this is done by force of almost equal quantities of the @xmath75 for all the cases of the @xmath9-intervals considered . 
 one can conclude the ga seems to be also hard to describe the intermittency effect especially when the phase transition is possible . in this sense 
 it is interesting to note that the ga and the nbd approach both are found @xcite to describe the cascade with small number of steps , reflecting invalidity of these approximations for the multiplicity asymptotics . 
 the non - gaussian character of the correlations in multihadron production was also shown earlier @xcite .    the same result though less clearly is seen ( fig . 2 and 3 ) 
 if the simple scale - invariant cascade model proposed by ochs and wosiek @xcite is applied . in this case a modified power - law ,    @xmath76^{\phi_q}\ , , \label{ow}\ ] ]    was showed to be universal dependence for large class of models and of the available data of the one- and multidimensional sfm @xcite . 
 here @xmath77 is the model - dependent function of @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 . 
 the conclusion agrees with the earlier observations @xcite and shouts to one another obtained in hadronic interactions @xcite . 
 thus all used model approximations , being based on the second order moments , indicate _ multiparticle character _ of the dynamical fluctuations at ( possible ) non - thermal ( _ peak _ ) phase transition . 
 the study of the intermittency phenomenon up to higher ranks of the scaled factorial moments of the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles produced in central c  cu interactions at 4.5 gev/@xmath1 per nucleon is performed . to eliminate the problem of the spectrum shape and to reach the higher multiple fluctuations 
 the transformed variables are used . 
 the unbiased modification is applied to the moments normalization to avoid a bias at small bins . 
 the study shows existence of intermittent - like increase of the moments at all the orders considered , leading to a pronounced multifractality . 
 the higher moment analysis allows to reveal two sharply differed increases with bin size , one of which indicates stronger intermittency and then non - thermal phase formation , and another one is usually connected with the weak intermittency when the critical @xmath3-order is not reached . while this comes from the fitting procedure at different bin intervals we are inclined to consider the fact obtained as a manifestation of different regimes of particle production at different scales of random cascading with a non - thermal phase transition inside . 
 the results are compared to ones given in the assumption of a validity of the negative binomial distribution , gaussian approximation and scale - invariant mass - splitting branching model . 
 the essential multiparticle character of the phase transition is indicated . 
 accounting possible hadronization influence on the dynamical correlations @xcite and search for the manifestations of a new matter formation the investigation of higher multiparticle fluctuations in nuclear collisions at intermediate energies gives evidence of further study of the effects observed .

89,"3c 445 ( z=0.05623 , eracleous & halpern 2004 ) is a powerful frii galaxy ( p@xmath4 w hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 ) showing a pair of double - lobes whose radio axis are misaligned by 2@xmath6 @xcite . 
 it it classified as a broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) because of its broad and intense balmer lines ( fhwm@xmath7=3@xmath8 km s@xmath5 ) produced in a region of size r=1.2@xmath9 cm @xcite . 
 the optical continuum exhibits decreasing polarization with increasing wavelength as expected in polarization induced by dichroic absorption ( rudy et al . 
 1983 , cohen et al . 1999 ) . 
 near infrared spectroscopical observations confirms a substantial reddening of the blrg region by e@xmath10 mag ( rudy & tokunga 1982 ) . 
 the broad @xmath11 line is also seen in polarized light . 
 its polarization angle changes by about 45@xmath6 from the red to the blue wings . 
 this suggests a blr inside the torus , rotating in an equatorial plane only partially seen by the observer . 
 both the red and blue - shifted emission lines from the clouds are scattered by material surrounding the blr . 
 cohen et al . 
 ( 1999 ) suggested that the scattering region coincides with the inner wall of the torus . 
 dust presence in 3c445 has been recently provided by iso and spitzer observations ( freudling et al . 
 2003 , haas et al . 
 in particular the radio - to infrared sed of 3c445 indicates a predominance of dust emission in the infrared region and a negligible contribution of synchrotron photons . 
 the sed modeling based on spherical radiative transfer calculations indicates an extended dust region of 125 pc radius and a quite large visual extinction a@xmath12 = 16 ( siebenmorgen et al . 
 the presence of cold circumnuclear matter has been also supported by several x - ray observations , all showing a nuclear component strongly absorbed . 
 the x - ray spectrum appears complex and structured requiring more power - laws absorbed by different column densities ( yamashita & inoue 1997 , sambruna et al . 
 1998 , wozniak et al . 
 1998 , grandi malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) . 
 interestingly , the estimated column density , ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) implies a reddening of the blr much larger than that observed ( if a standard galactic @xmath15 ratio is assumed ) . as discussed by maiolno et al . 
 ( 2001a , 2001b ) , this discrepancy can be solved if a predominance of larger dust grains ( when compared to the galactic interstellar medium ) occurs in the circumnuclear agn clouds . 
 although classified as broad line radio galaxy , 3c 445 appears to be a quite peculiar source , different from the other blrgs which are generally characterized by seyfert  1-like x - ray spectra ( grandi , malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) . 
 finally , we mention that a narrow line qso located at only @xmath16 from 3c  445 has been discovered by xmm - newton ( grandi et al . 2004 ) . 
 its spectrum is extremely soft and well represented by a power law ( photon index , @xmath17 ) plus a black body component ( @xmath18  ev ) absorbed by galactic @xmath19 . 
 the presence of this agn in the vicinity of 3c  445 adds uncertainties , casting doubts on previous x - ray analysis based on limited spatial resolution data . in this paper 
 we present a xmm - newton observation , which does unambiguously disentangle the different components of the 3c 445 spectrum . 
 in particular we show that the soft x - ray radiation is a mix of emission lines and scattered continuum produced by a photoionized gas located well beyond the torus and the blr . 
 a more coherent geometrical / physical picture of this source , more similar to seyfert 2 galaxies than to blrgs , will be proposed . 
 xmm - newton observed 3c  445 on december 6 2001 for 23 ks . in this 
 papers data of the reflection grating spectrometer [ rgs ; @xcite ) , and of the european photon imaging cameras ( epic - mos , @xcite ; epic - pn , @xcite ] are presented . 
 the epic ( mos and pn ) cameras were operated in `` small window '' mode . 
 the analysis was performed using the sas software ( version 6.5.0 ) . since no significant pile - up was present in the data , 
 single and double pixel events were selected . after filtering out periods of high background 
 we obtained net exposures of about 17  ks for the two mos camera and @xmath2012  ks for the pn camera . 
 the source plus background counts were extracted from circular regions with a radius of 42 arcsec ; the background spectra from source  free regions in the same chip as the source . 
 the response matrices were created using the sas commands arfgen and rmfgen .    the rgs yields high - resolution ( first order resolution 600 - 1700  km  s@xmath5 ) 
 spectra in the 635    ( 0.352  kev ) range . 
 the cross - dispersion slit has a 5@xmath21 diameter , thus encompassing the whole optical diameter of the optical galaxy . 
 data were reduced from the _ observation data files _ , according to standard procedures as in guainazzi & bianchi ( 2006 ) . 
 it suffices here to say that we have used sasv6.5 @xcite , and the most updated calibration file . 
 source spectra were generated assuming an aspect reconstruction centered on the nominal optical coordinates of the 3c  445 nucleus . 
 background spectra were generated from blank fields accumulated over the mission . 
 all spectral fits presented in this paper include absorption due to a line - of - sight galactic column density of @xmath19=5.01@xmath2210@xmath23 @xmath14 ( murphy et al . 
 errors are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level ( @xmath24 ) for one interesting parameter . 
 the cosmological parameters used throughout the paper are @xmath25 km@xmath5 s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath26 and q@xmath27= 0 . 
 the x - ray spectral complexity of 3c  455 is well known from previous studies . 
 therefore we initially decided to consider only the energy range between 2 - 10 kev to avoid the highly structured soft emission while analyzing the hard x - ray continuum . 
 the combination of a photoelectrically absorbed power - law and of a gaussian emission line profile was the first model applied to the epic spectra , simultaneously fitted . 
 the fit was formally acceptable , but the power law was extremely hard ( @xmath28 ) implying , as expected , that a more complicated model is required . 
 bepposax data ( grandi malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) indicated the presence of a reflection hump ad high energies , with a relative reflection normalization , r=1.2 . 
 however , it was impossible to significantly constrain the value of @xmath29 due to the insufficient quality of the data and to a possible contamination of the 15 - 100 kev spectrum by the nearby a2440 cluster . hence we aimed at verifying whether a reflection component was required by the epic spectra as well . 
 the quality of the fit improved after the inclusion of this component in the first model ( @xmath30 ) . however , the normalization of the reflection component was unusually large ( r@xmath315 ) and a power - law photon index still hard(@xmath32 ) . 
 as a strong reflected component can mimic an absorbed power - law , a different model was tried . 
 we tried to fix the relative normalization of the reflection component to the best - fit value measured by bepposax , and added a second power - law , with same spectral slope as that first model , screened by a different absorbing column density . 
 the fit improved again ( @xmath33 for a decrease by 1 in the number of degrees of freedom ) the photon index is not flat anymore ( @xmath34 ) , and closer to typically observed values . in this scenario , 
 a column density @xmath35 @xmath14 obscures @xmath36 of the hard continuum , whereas the remaining @xmath37 of the nuclear radiation is seen through less thick material , with @xmath38 @xmath14 . 
 the equivalent width of the neutral or mildly ionized iron k@xmath39 fluorescent emission line , @xmath40  ev , is in agreement with asca and bepposax results ( sambruna et al . 
 1998 , grandi et al . 2006 , dadina 2007 ) . as already suggested by wozniak et al . 
 ( 1998 ) , the cold gas covering the nuclear region is probably the source of the fe k@xmath39 line . 
 the fe equivalent width of @xmath41 ev is indeed in good agreement with the predictions of ghisellini haardt & matt ( 1994 ) , who simulated the contribution of circumnuclear ( toroidal ) matter to the x - ray spectrum of seyferts . 
 thus , assuming a keplerian motion of the obscuring matter and a black hole mass of @xmath42 m@xmath43 ( bettoni et al . 
 2003 ) , the intrinsic width of the fe line provides a rough estimate of the torus location @xmath44 cm . taking into account the @xmath45 uncertainties 
 , we estimate that the torus distance can not be smaller than 0.02 pc and larger than 0.7 pc .

 a summary of the best - fit parameters for the hard x - ray spectrum is shown in table  1 , while the detected lines are listed in table  2 . the broadband spectrum ( @xmath68  kev ) alongside the final model ( @xmath69 ) 
 is shown in figure  1 .

 [ fig3 ] . 
 interestingly enough , the best - fit centroid energy of the ovii h-@xmath73 triplet components is blue - shifted by @xmath74  km  s@xmath5 , suggesting that the line emitting gas is outflowing ( the typical statistical uncertainties on the rgs aspect solutions are @xmath31100  km  s@xmath5 at this wavelength ) . 
 however , this shift is not confirmed in the lower statistical quality oviii ly-@xmath73 line . 
 although it is potentially possible that ovii and oviii transitions are emitted in dynamically separated  phases of the photoionized gas , we still consider the evidence for outflowing gas in the nuclear environment of 3c  445 as tentative , to be confirmed by future , more accurate measurements .    a handful of fe - l transitions 
 are marginally detected as well , and not reported in tab . 
 they will not be further discussed hereafter . 
 the detection of the he - like oxygen triplet @xmath75 component is a clear indication for a photoionized plasma . 
 however , given the low significance of the detection , quantitative plasma diagnostics based on the triplet component intensity ratios @xcite are partly ambiguous 
 . only lower limits can be derived for the @xmath29 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . 
 although fully consistent with photoionized plasma , these value do not rule out collisional ionization . 
 guainazzi & bianchi 2007 proposed a difference diagnostics plane to discriminate _ on a statistical basis _ 
 photoionized- ( agn ) from collisionally ionized ( starburst ) powered sources : based on the intensity of the @xmath75 component of the ovii he - like triplet ( dubbed @xmath79 ratio , once normalized to the oviii ly-@xmath73 ) against the integrated luminosity @xmath80 of he- and h - like oxygen lines . 
 the values derived from the rgs spectrum of 3c  445 ( @xmath81 ; @xmath82  erg  s@xmath5 ) place 3c  445 in the plane region preferentially occupied by obscured agn . 
 although 3c445 is optically classified as blrg , its x - ray spectrum is similar to that observed in seyfert 2 galaxies . 
 the nuclear continuum is absorbed and the soft excess is well fitted by a weak power law plus emission lines . 
 the hard x - ray emission is attenuated by a complex absorber with 70@xmath83 of the nuclear continuum absorbed by a column density of @xmath84 @xmath1 ( first component ) and @xmath37 by a smaller column of @xmath85 @xmath1 ( second component ) . 
 about @xmath86 is attenuated only by the galactic @xmath87 ( third component ) . 
 these results can be most straightforwardly interpreted using an analogy with typical spectra of radio - quiet obscured agn . 
 a torus obscures the nuclear continuum ( first component ) that is probably associated to an accretion flow , while ionized gas , produces the soft lines and , acting as a mirror , scatters the x - ray continuum ( third component ) towards the observer beyond the outer rim of the torus . 
 the origin of the second component is less obvious . considering that 3c445 is a powerful radio galaxy 
 , it seems natural to associate it to a jet . 
 if this is the case , the strength of the non - thermal beamed radiation ( second component ) is smaller than the accretion flow ( first component ) by a factor @xmath88 in the 2 - 10 kev band . in spite of the apparent agreement with the results of grandi @xmath89 palumbo ( 2007 ) , who have attempted a first separation between the nuclear jet and disk in three blrgs ( 3c120 , 3c382 and 3c390.3 ) , the hypothesis is not completely convincing . from the radio flux ratio of the approaching and receding jets ( leahy et al 1997 ) 
 , we can obtain an estimate of the jet inclination , @xmath90 . 
 this is a rather large value if compared for example , with 3c120 and 3c390.3 that show inclination angle less than 14@xmath6 and 33@xmath6 , respectively ( eracleous & halpern 1999 ) . 
 although a large angle of view in 3c 445 justifies its strong nuclear absorption , it does not justify the intense luminosity of the putative jet . 
 an inclination of @xmath91 implies a small doppler factor @xmath92^{-1}$ ] , being @xmath93 and @xmath94 the bulk velocity in unit of c ] and , as a consequence a reduced flux amplification ( @xmath95 ) . 
 if the analogy with the other blrgs is correct , in 3c 445 the jet / disk ratio should be smaller at least by a factor ten . 
 alternatively , the second component could be disk radiation scattered within the torus and seen through the thinner layers of the obscuring matter . 
 if the gas distribution in the circumnuclear region indeed resembles that expected in seyfert  2 galaxies , we could be looking at nuclear region through a not uniform absorber ( turner et al . 
 1998 , weaver et al . 1999 ) with denser layers near the equatorial plane ( matt et al . 2000 ) . 
 accordingly to the model proposed for the broad line region , one could think that the inner walls of the torus are responsible for the scattered light . in this case 
 the scattering region should be completely ionized in order to act as a mirror . 
 although plausible , this interpretation can not completely explain the luminosity of the second component . 
 the ratio between direct and scattered radiation f=@xmath96 is expressed as a function of the solid angle subtended by the scattering source and the thompson depth f@xmath97 . even assuming that all the scattered light is seen by the observer through the thinner edge ( i.e. that we have a direct view of the equatorial plane ) , with a column density @xmath98 @xmath1 , the scattered radiation is less than 10@xmath83 . 
 another appealing interpretation involves photoionized gas within the blr . in this case 
 the scattered radiation should be observed through the same gas / dust layer which obscures the blr , assuming large dust grains in the circumnuclear agn clouds ( maiolino et al 2001a , 2001b ) to reconcile the the discrepancy between the estimated @xmath99 and the observed low reddening of the blr . 
 the idea that electron scattering can occur in blr has been proposed in the past to explain the large wings observed in the optical lines . very recently , 
 laor ( 2007 ) , analyzing high quality keck observations of ngc4395 , has shown that the h@xmath73 exponential wings can be actually produced within the blr gas if @xmath100 . 
 however this argument is still controversial . 
 although it seems plausible that @xmath101 , the real value of the electron scattering depth is still very uncertain .    in the case of 3c 445 , @xmath101 requires a solid angle subtended by the blr @xmath102 in order to deviate towards the observer @xmath37 of the primary radiation . 
 if the semi - aperture angle of the torus is equal to the inclination angle @xmath103 , the estimated solid angle @xmath104 is quite similar to that required to account for f=@xmath96 . 
 however , if @xmath105 is significantly smaller , for example it is near to the value proposed by laor ( 2007 ) , the high ratio between direct and scattered radiation observed in 3c 445 requires a larger solid angle for the blr or an additional source of photons ( for example , the inner wall of the torus ) . 
 thanks to the unprecedented combination of energy resolution and sensitivity of the rgs detector , the nature of the soft excess has been resolved in 3c  445 for the first time . 
 the rgs continuum exhibit typical features of seyfert  2 spectra . based on the bianchi & guainazzi ( 2007 ) diagnostic plane 
 , we argue that the emission lines originate in a warm gas photoionized by the nuclear engine . 
 the same material is most likely responsible for scattering some of the nuclear flow toward the observer . indeed 
 the ratio between the flux of the scattered and primary power law is @xmath106 per cent , in very good agreement with typical values observed in seyfert 2 galaxies ( mulchaey et al . 
 1993 , turner et al . 1997 ; bianchi , private communication ) . 
 since the ionized material is only attenuated by galactic n@xmath107 , it is natural to put it outside the torus and well beyond the blr . 
 the scattering / emitting gas could indeed coincide with the narrow line region , as recently suggested for seyfert 2 galaxies by bianchi , guainazzi & chiaberge ( 2006 ) on the base of the impressive morphological similarity between chandra and narrow - band hst images of 8 sources . 
 considering the strong similarity between seyfert 2s and 3c 445 ( scattered continuum and emission lines ) , a non thermal origin of the soft x - ray continuum appears very improbable . 
 the contribution of an extra nuclear jet to the spectrum below 2 kev , if present , has to be however marginal . 
 the detection of warm photo - ionized gas in the nuclear regions of radio galaxies is , in some regards , unexpected . 
 since asca , it is well known that warm gas , producing characteristic absorption spectral features , is present in the inner region of seyferts . on the contrary , up to now 
 , the only cold absorber has been unambiguously revealed in radio loud agn . 
 this result is very important and needs to be consolidated by large sample analysis . 
 we note in passing that , if confirmed , it would support the ( still debated ) idea that soft x - ray deficit seen in a handful of high redshift ( z@xmath108 ) radio loud quasars is due to warm gas ( worsley et al . 
 2004 , yuan et al . 
 it is indeed plausible that warm absorber seen in face - on sources is the same material that scatters nuclear x - rays into our line of sight in sources at larger inclination angle . 
 * an xmm - newton observation of the blrg 3c 445 reveals its hidden seyfert 2 nature . 
 * for the first time the soft excess of 3c 445 is resolved . 
 it is well fitted with highly ionized lines over - imposed to a weak continuum . 
 warm possibly outflowing gas located well beyond the torus , is responsible for the observed features . 
 the same emitting line gas deviates a fraction ( 3% ) of the primary x - ray continuum , escaping from the torus cone , towards the observer . * 
 the emerging picture is coherent and does not require an extra - nuclear jet to explain the soft unabsorbed flux . * about @xmath109 of the nuclear hard continuum is dominated by an accretion flow radiation transmitted through a column density @xmath110 @xmath14 . 
 the detected @xmath111 line has an equivalent width consistent with an origin in the line - of - sight absorber . about @xmath2 of the nuclear emission 
 is absorbed by a more tenuous column density @xmath112 @xmath14 . 
 * if the the observer has a deep view into the nucleus but near the edge of the torus , light scattered by the inner wall of the torus and/or by the blr region could ( at least in part ) account for the less absorbed nuclear component .

90,"although the standard @xmath3 electroweak gauge theory successfully explains all current electroweak data , the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been tested only partially . since in the standard model spontaneous symmetry breaking 
 is due to the higgs mechanism , the search for a higgs particle will be one of the main tasks of future colliders . + at present , lep gives a lower limit of 114.4 gev / c@xmath4 @xcite for the higgs boson mass . 
 there is also an indirect upper limit from electroweak precision measurements of 219 gev / c@xmath4 at a 95% confidence level @xcite which is valid in the minimal standard model . 
 however , this limit is still preliminary and the quality of the sm fit , when including all ew measurements from both low and high energy experiments , is still an object of discussion amongst experts @xcite . 
 furthermore , a heavier higgs boson would be consistent with the electroweak precision measurements in models more general than the minimal standard model @xcite . in this first analysis 
 we will therefore also consider higher higgs masses well above this limit , as can be produced at high energy hadron colliders such as the lhc ( pp collisions at 14 tev ) . 
 a standard model higgs boson lying below the @xmath5 threshold will mainly decay into a @xmath6 pair . in this case 
 , there is an overwhelming direct qcd background which dominates the signal . 
 therefore , the higgs boson is difficult to study in detail in this mass region , even though one can use rare decays as a signal . 
 rare decays considered in the literature include , for example , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 . 
 all of these signals are rather difficult to see , but can eventually be used to establish the existence of the higgs boson @xcite . while these decay modes can be used to discover the higgs boson , a detailed study of its properties will be difficult . 
 + the situation is much better for a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath12 ) . 
 for such a higgs boson the main decay products are vector boson pairs , @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for the latter decay mode , a clear signal for the higgs 
 consists of a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the produced vector bosons . 
 the double leptonic decay of the @xmath15 boson , @xmath16 , leads to a particularly clean signal . 
 + in this case , the basic strategy for discovering a higgs boson in a clean mode is to select events with 4 high p@xmath17 leptons that can be combined to form two z - bosons . here , an exposure of 30 fb@xmath2 is already sufficient . 
 if one finds such a signal one might be tempted to assume this to be the standard model higgs boson . however , given the fact that the higgs sector is not fully prescribed , one has to allow for other possibilities . in strongly interacting models , for instance , low lying ( pseudo-)vector resonances are possible@xcite 
 . also , pseudoscalar particles are present in a variety of models @xcite . therefore , the first priority after finding a signal is to establish the nature of the resonance , in particular its spin and cp - eigenvalue . 
 this can be done by studying angular distributions and correlations among the decay leptons . in the following 
 , we will make this study . 
 we will limit ourselves to ( pseudo-)vector and ( pseudo-)scalar particles . to demonstrate consistency with a spin 0 , cp even hypothesis , we will compare the angular distributions , to those produced by different particles , always assuming the production rate of a standard model higgs boson . 
 this is the right assumption to make because , in order to be recognized as a candidate for a standard model like higgs , the detected signal must be a resonance with the appropriate width and branching ratios . since the production mechanism - gluon - fusion rules out spin 1 particles , due to yang s theorem@xcite - can not be seen , the only way to prove that the spin and cp nature of the new particle is standard model like is to study the decay angles of the leptons . 
 + theoretical studies of angular distributions have been performed in the literature [ 9 - 15 ] . 
 so far , such studies have been limited to theoretical discussions . 
 however , it was shown in @xcite that acceptance and efficiencies of the detector can play a role since they can generate correlations , mimicking physical ones . 
 therefore , it is necessary to use a detector simulation in order to establish how well one can do in practice . 
 + the complete triple differential cross - sections for a higgs - boson decaying into two onshell z - bosons which subsequently decay into fermion pairs can be calculated at tree level . 
 the angular dependence of this cross section is given in the appendix together with the most important integrated angular distributions . 
 for the definition of the angles see figure 1 . 
 +    we study essentially two distributions . 
 one is the distribution of the cosine of the polar angle , @xmath18 , of the decay leptons relative to the @xmath15 boson . 
 because the heavy higgs decays mainly into longitudinally polarised vector bosons the cross section @xmath19 should show a maximum around @xmath20)=0 . 
 the other is the distribution of the angle @xmath21 between the decay planes of the two @xmath15 bosons in the rest frame of the higgs boson . 
 this distribution depends on the details of the higgs decay mechanism . within the standard model , 
 a behaviour roughly like @xmath22 is expected . 
 this last distribution is flattened in the decay chain @xmath23 , because of the small vector coupling of the leptons , in contrast to the decay of the higgs boson into w s or decay of the z into quarks . 
 also , cuts can significantly affect the correlations . 
 therefore one needs a precise measurement of the momenta of the outgoing leptons 
 . the atlas - detector should be well - suited to measure these distributions , since the muon and electron reconstruction is very precise over a large solid angle . 
 a detector monte - carlo is however needed in order to determine whether the angular distributions can be measured sufficiently well in order to determine the quantum numbers of the higgs particle . 
 + the present paper is organized as follows . in chapter 2 the generator 
 is described , in chapter 3 detector simulation and reconstruction are given . in chapter 4 
 we define quantities that can be used to characterize the different distributions . 
 in chapter 5 we present the results , concluding that the quantum numbers of the higgs particle can indeed be determined . in the appendix 
 we give formulae for the complete differential and integrated distributions for the decay of the resonance assuming arbitrary couplings computed in tree level and narrow width approximation . 
 in order to distinguish between different and/or cp - eigenvalues @xmath24 one needs to study four different distributions : that resulting from the decay of the standard model higgs boson , and the three distributions that would result from hypothetical particles with spin and cp - eigenvalue combinations ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , -1 ) . 
 the feasibility of using angular correlations in the decay of the z bosons in order to distinguish between these particles has been evaluated using two different monte - carlo generators . 
 one was written for the standard model higgs ( @xmath25 ) and the irreducible zz - background.@xcite the latter includes contributions from both gluons and quarks to the zz production ( and ) , whereas all higgs production mechanisms other than the gluon fusion are neglected . 
 this generator keeps all polarisations of the z - boson for the quark initiated as well as for the gluon initiated processes . 
 this allows for an analysis of the angular distributions of the leptons . 
 the gluonic production of z - boson pairs is only about 30% of the total background . 
 however , one should not ignore its contribution , since it has different angular distributions from the other backgrounds and its presence can affect measured correlations . 
 the programme contains no k - factors , therefore our conclusions regarding the feasibility of the determination of higgs quantum numbers are conservative . 
 indeed , k - factors are expected to be larger for gluon - induced processes ( such as the signal ) than for quark - induced processes ( 70% of the background ) . since the narrow width approximation is used , the results are only valid for higgs masses above the zz threshold . + for the alternative particles , a new generator was written based on an article by c. a. nelson and j. r. dell aquilla @xcite . 
 the programmes for the production of background , the standard model higgs and all alternative particles use cteq4 m structure functions @xcite and hdecay @xcite for branching - ratio and width of the higgs , and all use the narrow width approximation . 
 the background as well as all cross sections for the four simulations are taken from the first generator . 
 thus , all cases show identical distributions of invariant mass of the z - pairs and transverse momentum @xmath26 of z - bosons and leptons and have the same width and cross sections . 
 the only difference lies in the angular distributions of the leptons . for the alternative particles 
 no special assumption concerning the coupling has to be made ; only cp - invariance is assumed . 
 it is worth mentioning that the angular correlations are completely independent of the production mechanism . 
 the detector response is simulated using atlfast @xcite , a software - package for particle level simulation of the atlas detector . 
 it is used for fast event - simulation including the most crucial detector aspects . 
 starting from a list of particles in the event , it provides a list of reconstructed jets , isolated leptons and photons and expected missing transverse energy . 
 it applies momentum- and energy- smearing to all reconstructed particles . 
 the values of the detector - dependent parameters are chosen to match the expected performance that was evaluated mostly by full simulations using geant3@xcite . 
 + the event selection is modeled exactly after the event selection in the atlas - physics - tdr @xcite . 
 four leptons ( electrons or muons ) are required in the pseudorapidity range ( @xmath27 being the angle to the beam axis ) . 
 two of the leptons are required to have transverse momenta greater than 20 gev / c and the two other leptons must have transverse momenta greater than 7 gev / c each . a lepton identification efficiency of 90% per lepton was assumed . 
 two z bosons are reconstructed by choosing lepton - pairs of matching flavour and opposite sign . 
 if the flavours of all four leptons are equal , the combination is chosen , which minimizes the sum of the squared deviation of the invariant mass of the pairs with opposite sign from the z mass ( i.e. choose combination ab / cd that minimizes ( m@xmath28-m@xmath29)@xmath4 + ( m@xmath30-m@xmath29)@xmath4 ) . 
 the reconstructed invariant mass of the two reconstructed z bosons has to lie within two times the width of the reconstructed mass peak of the higgs resonance around the centre of the peak . for high higgs masses ( @xmath31 300gev / c@xmath4 ) 
 this is only little more than two times the decay width , while for smaller masses the experimental resolution dominates . 
 + throughout this paper , we use the term signal for distributions where the background has been statistically subtracted . 
 the only background considered is the z pair production . 
 other possible backgrounds like top pair production or zbb are negligible for masses of the higgs boson above 200 gev / c@xmath4 . 
 systematic uncertainties due to the simulation of the background could be studied by comparing distributions from the sidebins of the higgs signal with the results of the generator . 
 a proper treatment of the background is very important , since the angular distributions of the background itself and correlations introduced by detector effects have a large impact on the shape of the distributions discussed . 
 these effects are detailed below . 
 +    for high invariant masses , the z bosons from the background processes are mainly transversely polarised leading to a polar angle distribution of the form @xmath32 . 
 this distribution flattens the @xmath33 distribution expected for the higgs decay . 
 figure [ figpolar1 ] shows the polar angle distributions of the signal ( left ) and the background ( right ) . 
 the dashed line shows the shape of the distribution expected when no cuts are applied and the detector response is not taken into account . 
 it has just been scaled by the overall acceptance of the cuts , so that the shape can be compared . 
 the expected distribution with all cuts and smearing applied is drawn as a solid line . 
 figures [ figpolar1 ] and [ figplane1 ] are produced assuming a higgs mass of 200gev / c@xmath4 and z decaying to muons only . 
 for the decay zz @xmath0 e@xmath34e@xmath35e@xmath34e@xmath35 or zz 
 @xmath0 @xmath36e@xmath34e@xmath35 the graphs look similar . 
 the smearing effects are largely independent of the higgs mass . 
 +    the effect of the detector acceptance and isolation cuts on the decay plane angle distribution is shown in figure [ figplane1 ] . 
 again , the distribution of the signal is shown left and the background right . 
 the dashed histogrammes are scaled to have the same integral as the solid histogrammes , and zero is suppresssed in order to facilitate the comparison of the shape . 
 the definition of the line styles are the same as above . for the decay plane angle , 
 the background shows an almost flat distribution before applying selection cuts . but a minor correlation is introduced by detector effects . 
 this has been simulated and taken into account for the analysis of decay plane angle distributions . in conclusion , 
 the isolation cuts lead to a small distortion of the angular distributions as discussed in @xcite , but these effects are almost negligible for the atlas detector . 
 the cut on @xmath37 enhances the decay plane correlation a little , but the smearing and the @xmath26 requirements reduce this effect . 
 altogether , there is a small enhancement of the correlation of almost the same amount for all four particles . 
 + a further cut on the transverse momentum of the z bosons @xmath38 is known to additionally reduce the background , but it also affects the correlation . since an optimisation of the signal - to - background ratio is not crucial to this analysis , this cut has not been applied , rendering the analysis less dependent on the details of the production mechanism like initial @xmath39 of the higgs boson . + 
 the differential cross sections for the different models can be computed directly or can be derived from the formulae given in @xcite . 
 the explicit distributions are given in the appendix . from the article 
 @xcite we quote the simple distributions of the alternative particles . table [ distriint1 ] shows the distribution of the polar angle @xmath40 . 
 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the polar angles of the leptons originating from the z bosons @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively . in table 
 [ distriint2 ] , the distribution of the decay plane angle @xmath21 is shown where the polar angle @xmath40 is integrated over different ranges . 
 f11 gives the distribution for @xmath45 , f22 for @xmath46 , f12 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and f21 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . 
 @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the parameters that characterise the decay density matrix . for the decay modes used in this analysis , they amount to the following values : @xmath55 = @xmath52 = -1/2 , @xmath53 = @xmath54 = @xmath56 . 
 r is the ratio of the axial vector to vector coupling which for the muons amounts to r = ( 1 - 4@xmath57 . 
 we used @xmath58 = 0.23 . 
 +    .distribution of the polar angle @xmath40 . 
 @xmath59 are the legendre polynomials . 
 see the text for definitions . [ 
 cols=""<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]     the shift of the parameter is thus expected to be less than @xmath10.01 . again , this is very small compared to the statistical error of @xmath60r@xmath61 = 0.053 . 
 this error is not considered in the rest of the analysis . 
 furthermore , the effects will be even smaller when considering k - factors . 
 any k greater than 1 will give better conditions to check the background distributions . and 
 , since the k - factor of the gluonic higgs production is higher than the k - factor of the main zz production process by quark antiquark pairs , the signal to background ratio will be even higher than predicted here . 
 in chapter 4 , the exact results for the signal were given . 
 however , in practice one needs a procedure to separate signal from background , which will lead to uncertainties in the distributions . 
 the expected errors have been calculated by generating a large number of events and scaling the distributions to the expected number of events , since the expected values of the parameters follow a gaussian distribution . 
 the background was statistically subtracted after applying the same cuts to it as were applied to the signal . 
 the error reflects the statistical error from the number of the signal events , the statistical error from the number of background events subtracted and the error made by the estimation of the number of background events as described in chapter 5 . 
 no error from a possibly different angular distribution of background events has been taken into acount , but we have shown that the effect is small . 
 then the parametrisations for @xmath21 and @xmath40 as described above were fitted to the distributions . 
 signal and background are summed over muons and electrons . 
 + figure [ figpars ] ( top ) shows the expected values and errors for the parameter r , using an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 . 
 it is clearly visible that for masses above 250 gev / c@xmath4 the measurement of this parameter allows the various hypotheses considered here for the spin and cp - state of the `` higgs boson '' to be unambiguously separated . for a higgs mass of 200 
 gev/@xmath62 only the pseudoscalar is excluded . 
 figure [ figpars ] ( bottom ) shows the expected values and errors for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for a 200 gev / c@xmath4 higgs and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 . 
 + the parameter @xmath63 can be used to distinguish between a spin 1 and the sm higgs particle , but its use is statistically limited . 
 the same applies to the parameter @xmath64 . 
 measuring @xmath64 , which is zero for spin 1 and @xmath65 0 in the sm case , can contribute only very little to the spin measurement even if @xmath66 is in the range where @xmath64 , in the sm case , is close to its maximum value . 
 nevertheless , @xmath64 can be useful to rule out a cp odd spin 0 particle . 
 + the values of @xmath63 get more widely separated when the correlation between the sign of @xmath67 for the two z bosons and @xmath21 is exploited . in figure 
 [ figsym ] , we plot the parameters separately for @xmath68 ( f11 + f22 in table [ distriint2 ] ) and @xmath69 ( f12 + f21 in table [ distriint2 ] ) . as can be seen , the difference in @xmath63 becomes bigger for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . 
 for higher masses @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the sm higgs approach 0 ; thus only @xmath63 can be used to measure the spin . 
 but the measurement of r compensates this . 
 + figure [ figsig ] shows the significance , i. e. the difference of the expected values divided by the expected error of the sm higgs . 
 we add up the significance for @xmath63 and @xmath64 exploiting the @xmath67 - @xmath21 correlation and plot the significance from the polar angle measurement separately . for higher 
 higgs masses the decay plane angle correlation contributes almost nothing , but the polarisation leads to a good measurement of the parameters spin and cp - eigenvalue . for full luminosity ( 300 fb@xmath2 ) 
 the significance can simply be multiplied by @xmath72 . 
 this is especially interesting for a higgs mass of 200 gev / c@xmath4 . 
 the spin 1 , cp even hypothesis can then be ruled out with a significance of 6.4@xmath73 , while for the spin 1 , cp odd case the significance is still only 3.9@xmath73 . 
 +    in conclusion , for higgs masses larger than about 230gev / c@xmath4 a spin 1 hypothesis can be clearly ruled out already with 100 fb@xmath2 . for m@xmath74 around 200gev 
 / c@xmath4 the distinction is less clear , and one will need the full integrated luminosity of the lhc . 
 a spin - cp hypothesis of 0- can be ruled out with less than 100 fb@xmath75 for the whole mass range above and around 200 gev / c@xmath4 .

 the most general coupling of a ( pseudo ) scalar higgs boson to two on - shell z - bosons is of the following form :      here the momentum of the first z - boson is @xmath77 , that of the second z - boson is @xmath78 . 
 the momentum of the higgs boson is @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the total antisymmetric tensor with @xmath81 . within the standard model one 
 has @xmath82 , @xmath83 . for a pure pseudoscalar particle one 
 has @xmath84 . 
 if both @xmath85 and one of the other interactions are present , one can not assign a definite parity to the higgs boson . 
 + the same formula for a ( pseudo ) vector with momentum @xmath86 reads : @xmath87 it is to be noted that the coupling to the vector field actually contains only two parameters and is therefore simpler than to the scalar . + in the following 
 we give the angular dependence of the triple differential cross section for the case of a scalar or vector higgs decaying into two on - shell z bosons which subsequently decay into two lepton pairs . 
 the meaning of the angles @xmath88 and @xmath21 is explained in figure [ figplanes ] . 
 @xmath89 is the absolute value of the momentum of the z boson , @xmath90 . in the following we use the definitions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .

91,"according to the standard unification model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , seyfert 2 galaxies are intrinsically the same as seyfert 1 galaxies . 
 the observed differences between the two types of seyfert galaxies are primarily due to an orientation effect ( antonucci 1993 ) . 
 the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies is due to obscuration by an optically thick structure ( the so - called dusty torus ) from our line of sight . 
 optical spectropolarimetry observations have detected hidden broad emission lines in a large fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies ( moran et al . 
 2000 ; tran 2001 ) , providing strong evidence in favor of the unification model . 
 further support for this model is given by the x - ray studies that have demonstrated that many seyfert 2 galaxies are absorbed by large hydrogen column densities ( typically @xmath1 @xmath2 ; e.g. , risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) . 
 however , recent observations have shown that a fraction of type 2 agns show no or very low x - ray absorption measured from their x - ray spectra ( @xmath3 @xmath2 ; e.g. , pappa et al . 
 2001 ; panessa & bassani 2002 ; walter et al . 2005 ; gliozzi , sambruna & foschini 2007 ) , apparently in contrast to the standard unification model . 
 panessa & bassani ( 2002 ) estimate the percentage of this type of source in the range 10%20% . this number is larger than that found by risaliti et al . 
 ( 1999 ) in a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( 4% ) , but consistent with the estimate made by caccianiga et al . 
 ( 2004 , 12% ) . 
 x - ray unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies may result from the dust reddening intrinsic to the broad line region ( blr ) rather than the orientation - based obscuration effects ( barcons , carrera & ceballos 2003 ; corral et al . 
 2005 ) . alternatively , 
 the unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies may genuinely lack the blr as a result of low accretion rate ( georgantopoulos & zezas 2003 ; bianchi et al . 2008 ; panessa et al . 
 in other words , low - accretion rate systems may not form a stable blr ( see nicastro 2000 for the model ) , so they would not show broad lines in their optical spectra , and not necessarily being obscured in x - ray . though the discovery of `` unobscured '' type 2 agns has important implications for the current unification model ( i.e. , in addition to the orientation effects , other physical effects should be invoked to interpret the difference observed between type 1 and type 2 agns ) , only few objects have yet been conclusively proven as a class . 
 it has been argued that some `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxies are actually compton - thick ( e.g. , pappa et al . 2001 ) , in which the direct nuclear component below 10 kev is completely suppressed and we would only witness an unabsorbed spectrum due to scattered nuclear radiation and/or host galaxy emission from a circumnuclear starburst . more recently , brightman & nandra ( 2008 ) presented a detailed spectral analysis of six unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies , and found that four out of them are in fact heavily obscured ( see also ghosh et al . 
 in addition , shi et al . 
 ( 2010 ) presented a multi - wavelength study of a sample of unobscured seyfert 2 galaxies , and found that most of them are actually intermediate - type agns with broad emission lines or compton - thick sources . 
 therefore , one has to be cautious in identifying the candidates of the unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies . in this paper , we present new _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 7590 , one of the so - called `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxies . 
 ngc 7590 ( @xmath4 ) belongs to the extended 12  @xmath5 m sample ( rush , malkan & spinoglio 1993 ) . 
 no broad h@xmath6 emission line is visible in either direct or polarized light ( heisler , lumsden & bailey 1997 ) . the first x - ray spectrum observed by _ 
 asca _ was analyzed by bassani et al ( 1999 ) . 
 their best - fit model is an unabsorbed power law with @xmath7 , and n@xmath8 @xmath2 . 
 no fe k emission line is detected in the _ asca _ data . 
 @xmath9 hri imaging has shown that there is an off - nuclear ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) that is probably associated with the galaxy ngc 7590 ( colbert & ptak 2002 ) . 
 the better spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ allows us to see more directly the x - ray emission from the nuclear region . in the following 
 , a cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is assumed throughout . 
 the _ xmm - newton _ pointing observation of ngc 7590 ( denoted obs 1 ) was made on 2007 april 30 for a duration of about 45 ks . besides the pointing observation , the source was also detected @xmath14 9 arcmin away from the center of the field of view ( fov ) of ngc 7582 _ xmm - newton _ 
 observations during revolution 267 ( 2001 may , obs 2 ) for @xmath1423 ks and revolution 987 ( 2005 april , obs 3 ) for @xmath14 102 ks . 
 the calibrated event lists for both the pn and the mos observations were extracted using the epchain and emchain pipeline tasks provided by the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) version 9.0.0 , using the latest calibration files available at the time of analysis ( 2009 august ) . in our analysis 
 we deal only with events corresponding to patterns 0 - 4 for the pn and 0 - 12 for the mos instruments . 
 we excluded the epochs of high background events with sas task @xmath15 . 
 as an instance , we plot in figure 1 the pn and mos1 light curves of obs1 ( black ) , which was heavily polluted by high background flares , together with the derived good time intervals ( green ) by @xmath15 . 
 the log of all the _ xmm - newton _ observations with net exposure times is shown in table 1 . 
 details of both source and background spectra extraction are shown in section 3.2 . 
 in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and fully utilize the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ , we extracted a co - added mos image from three observations , which has better spatial resolution than pn detector , and re - binned with a pixel size of 1.1@xmath16 ( 1 mos pixel ) . 
 the resultant image is displayed in figure 2 ( a ) . 
 the cross marks the optical center of the galaxy . 
 a bright point - like source ( source x-1 ) is detected by _ xmm - newton _ about 25@xmath16  away from the galaxy nucleus , which was originally detected in the @xmath9 all - sky survey , identified as a ulx by colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) . 
 it can be seen from figure 2 ( a ) that the emission of ngc 7590 is resolved at the _ xmm - newton _ spatial resolution , extending to tens of arcsec from the center . to quantify this 
 , we first extract the radial profile of the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 . to avoid the contamination from the bright off - nuclear x-1 , only photons below the dashed line in figure 2 . 
 ( a ) were extracted with 1.1  annular bins . 
 the radial profile for x-1 was also extracted ( without excluding the extended emission from ngc 7590 ) for comparison . 
 the resulting radial profiles normalized to the peak brightness of ngc 7590 are shown in figure 2(c ) . 
 we then fitted the radial profiles with the mos point - spread function ( psf ) model from calibration files using the sas routine @xmath17 . 
 it is obvious in the figure that the radial profile of ngc 7590 significantly differs from that of the off - nuclear source x-1 and mos psf model out to radii of @xmath1430 , showing that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is clearly extended . 
 the radial profile of the ulx is in crude agreement with the psf model , as expected from a point source emission . 
 we further used scisim ( version 2.1 ) to simulate a mos image of two point sources at the same position of the ulx and the nucleus of ngc 7590 . 
 we first extracted the x - ray counts from the observed image for the ulx within an aperture responding to the @xmath1450% encircled energy radius ( @xmath149@xmath16)50% of all the x - ray photons are encircled within this radius . 
 see _ xmm - newton _ users handbook , section 3.2.1 ] , and estimated total net counts of @xmath18 for ulx after aperture correction . 
 we then subtracted 1730 from the total counts of ulx plus ngc 7590 within 40@xmath16  radius circle and obtained net counts of @xmath14 1380 for ngc 7590 itself . in our simulation 
 , we assumed that both ngc 7590 and ulx would have a power law spectrum with @xmath19 . 
 local background was added to the simulated image and the result is shown in figure 2(b ) . by comparing the simulated image with the observed one 
 , we see that the observed x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is clearly extended . 
 we also created a co - added pn image ( excluding obs 3 ) with a pixel size of @xmath20 ( 1 pn pixel ) , and extracted radial profiles from it for ngc 7590 and ulx . 
 figure 2(d ) and ( f ) show the resulting pn image and radial profiles , which are similar to that of mos , confirming that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is extended . 
 we also present archival rosat hri image for ngc 7590 ( figure 2(e ) ) , which has even better spatial resolution than _ xmm - newton _ . 
 however , the hri image is too shallow for more detailed spatial analysis , and its soft x - ray coverage prevents us from estimating the nuclei hard x - ray emission . 
 there is possibility that the observed spatial extent of ngc 7590 and ulx is due to the alignment errors when adding images of three _ xmm - newton _ observations for both pn and mos data respectively . to test this , we extracted the radial profile of x - ray emission of ngc 7590 and ulx , using only mos image of obs 3 ( figures 3.(a ) and ( d ) ) , which has the longest exposure . compared to figures 2.(a ) and ( c ) , 
 we do not found significant difference in the spatial extent of ngc 7590 and ulx , indicating it is unlikely that the observed extended emission of ngc 7590 is caused by image alignment errors . 
 3(b ) and ( c ) show the soft - band ( 0.52 kev ) and hard - band ( 210 kev ) mos images of obs 3 , and figures ( e ) and ( f ) are the extracted radial profile , respectively . 
 it can be seen that the spatial extent of soft - band emission of ngc 7590 and ulx agrees well with previous results . 
 all these results suggest that the ulx is a point - like source , but the x - ray emission of ngc 7590 is clearly extended . indeed 
 , it is presumable that the hard - band image of ngc 7590 will be more point - like . 
 however , as one can see from figure . 
 3(c ) , the hard - band emission of ngc 7590 is relatively rather weak . due to 
 the poor s / n of the radial profile of ngc 7590 ( figure . 
 3(f ) ) , we can not tell whether its hard - band emission is extended or more point - like . 
 @xmath21 spectra for ngc 7590 and x-1 were both extracted for spectral analysis . for ulx x-1 , to minimize the contamination from the extended emission in ngc 7590 , we extracted source spectra using a 9@xmath16 radius circle ( encircles @xmath1450% of all the x - ray photons at off - axis angles less than 10 arcmin on the mos detector , see section 3.1 ) for both pn and mos cameras , and aperture correction was applied after spectral fitting . for ngc 7590 , we extracted source spectra from a circular region with a radius of 40  centered at the galaxy nucleus , but excluded all photons above the dashed line in figure 2(a ) to reduce the pollution from x-1 . 
 assuming that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is symmetric to the dashed line , hereafter we applied flux correction by a factor of 2 to the spectral fitting results to estimate the total x - ray flux from ngc 7590 ( excluding x-1 ) . 
 for both pn and mos data , the background events were then extracted from a source - free area on the same ccd using two circular regions with a combined area @xmath14 4 times larger than the source region . 
 the response matrix and ancillary response file for the pn spectrum were generated using the rmfgen and arfgen tools within the sas software . 
 we examined the source light curves of ngc 7590 and ulx , and found no significant intra - exposure variations . 
 no spectral variations between individual exposures were detected either through preliminary spectral fitting . 
 hereafter , we combined spectra from individual exposures to increase the spectral quality and finally obtained one pn and one mos spectra for each source ( ngc 7590 and x-1 ) . 
 the combined spectra were then grouped to have at least 1 count per bin , and the @xmath22-statistics ( cash 1979 ) was adopted for minimization . 
 spectral fitting was performed jointly to the pn and mos data in the 0.38 kev range using xspec ( version 11.3.2 ) . 
 all statistical errors given hereafter correspond to 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ( @xmath23 ) , unless stated otherwise . in all of the model fitting , 
 the galactic column density was fixed at @xmath24 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) . 
 all model parameters will be referred to in the source frame .    _ 
 ngc 7590 : _ we first performed the spectral fitting with a simple absorbed power law . 
 the best - fitting parameters are @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xmath2 , with @xmath22=520.8 for 436 degrees of freedom . 
 we note that the simple absorbed power law model does not provide a good representation of the data , leaving the significant residuals at the low energy of the spectra . 
 x - ray studies of seyfert 2 galaxies have shown that their spectra often show a soft excess at lower energy band , presumably due to a thermal emission component ( e.g. , cappi et al . 
 thus we added an optically - thin thermal emission component ( using the apec model in xspec ) to the absorbed power law . 
 a significantly improved fit ( @xmath27 for two extra parameters ) is obtained with best - fitting temperature of the thermal component @xmath28 = 0.31@xmath29 kev . 
 we then obtained the photon index @xmath30 , while the column density is constrained to be less than @xmath31 @xmath2 . when we add a narrow gaussian line , with energy fixed at 6.4 kev ( the rest energy of the fe  k@xmath6 line ) to the above model , the change of @xmath32 is less than 1 for addition of one free parameter , suggesting that the line is not detected . 
 we therefore obtained an upper limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line of @xmath14680 ev . 
 the best - fitting model gives the observed @xmath33 erg s@xmath11 and @xmath34 erg s@xmath11 . in table 2 
 , we show the best - fitting parameters , together with the model flux and luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band . 
 10@xmath35 @xmath36 for ngc 7590 based on _ asca _ data . 
 this is much larger than the sum of the _ xmm - newton _ flux of ngc 7590 and x-1 , which is only @xmath14 1.4 @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath36 . through independent spectral fitting to archival _ asca _ data 
 , we obtained an _ asca _ flux of @xmath14 1.8 @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath36 , close to _ xmm - newton _ results . 
 the flux presented by bassani et al . for ngc 7590 is thus incorrect and could be a typo . ] 
 the spectra are shown in figure 4 ( upper panel ) , together with the best - fit model and the residuals from the best - fit model .     spatial analysis ( section 3.1 ) 
 has shown that the x - ray emission of ngc 7590 is dominated by both the ulx and an extended component from the host galaxy . to probe the true nuclear emission due to the agn 
 , we performed a spectral extraction centered at the optically defined nucleus using a circular region of 9@xmath16 radius ( 50% encircled - energy radius ) . 
 the derived spectra could be best - fitted by an absorbed power law with n@xmath39 @xmath2 and @xmath40 , plus a thermal component @xmath41@xmath42 kev . 
 the resulting x - ray flux f@xmath43 = 1.6@xmath44 @xmath36 ( after aperture correction ) , and the upper limit to fe k@xmath6 line ew rises to 2060 ev ( see table 2 ) . 
 note that the derived flux could serve as an upper limit to the nuclear x - ray emission in ngc 7590 . 
 _ ngc  7590  x-1 : _ ngc 7590 x-1 is an extranuclear x - ray source , originally detected in the @xmath9 all - sky survey ( colbert & ptak 2002 ) . 
 _ xmm - newton _ spectra are well fitted with an absorbed power - law model with @xmath45 @xmath2 , @xmath46 , and @xmath22/dof=657/758 . 
 the observed 0.52 kev and 210 kev fluxes ( after aperture correction ) were @xmath47 @xmath36 and @xmath48 @xmath36 , respectively . 
 if the source is associated with ngc 7590 , the implied 210 kev luminosity is 5.7@xmath49 @xmath50 , making it as a ulx . 
 the addition of a multicolor disk blackbody component is not statistically significant ( @xmath22 decreased by only 2.6 for the addition of two free parameters ) . 
 the _ xmm - newton _ spectra together with the best - fit model and residual are shown in figure 4 ( lower panel ) . 
 ngc  7590 was previously identified as an `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxy , on the basis of the _ asca _ spectrum ( bassani et al . 1999 ) . 
 however , the poor x - ray spatial resolution of _ asca _ ( @xmath141@xmath51 psf fwhm ) casts doubt that the x - ray flux may be contaminated by nearby bright sources . 
 thanks to its better spatial resolution ( @xmath146@xmath16 psf fwhm ) , the _ xmm - newton _ data clearly show that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is dominated by an off - nuclear ulx and an extended component from the host galaxy .     by performing a spectral extraction using a circular region of 9@xmath16 radius ( 50% encircled - energy radius ) 
 , we gave an upper limit to the nuclei x - ray emission f@xmath43 = 1.6@xmath44 @xmath36  ( after aperture correction ) . 
 although the best fitting @xmath52 is less than @xmath53 @xmath2 , we find an upper limit to the @xmath54 ratio ( @xmath55}$ ] @xmath56 0.09)}$ ] has been extinction - corrected ( panessa & bassani 2002 ) . ] . 
 this value is in the range for the compton - thick agns ( bassani et al . 
 1999 ; guainazzi et al 2005 ) . 
 the fe k@xmath6 line was not detected with _ 
 xmm - newton _ and we could only obtain an upper limit of ew @xmath56 2 kev , which is consistent with @xmath141 kev expected in the case of a compton - thick agn .    with _ asca _ 
 data , nicastro , martocchia & matt ( 2003 ) estimated that the accretion rate for ngc 7590 is very low ( @xmath57 ) , suggesting it may intrinsically lack a blr . 
 meanwhile , ngc 7590 has not shown a hidden blr in polarized light ( heisler et al . 
 tran ( 2001 ) finds that the seyfert 2 galaxies without hidden blrs are those with the lowest luminosity , while shu et al . 
 ( 2007 ) suggested that the non - detection of hidden blrs is ascribed to the large obscuration . making use of @xmath58 measured by _ xmm - newton _ 
 , we attempted to derive the accretion rate for ngc 7590 to determine whether it is still consistent with the nicastro et al . 
 ( 2003 ) results . 
 if ngc 7590 is explained as compton thick , the direct measurement of its intrinsic x - ray luminosity seems to be impossible . 
 thus , with a correction factor of 60 to its intrinsic luminosity ( e.g. , panessa et al . 
 2006 ) and a black hole mass of 6.2@xmath59 derived from @xmath60 relation ( bian & gu 2007 ) , we obtain a rough estimate for ngc 7590 the accretion rate @xmath61 , a value close to the threshold ( @xmath62 ) for blr formation proposed by nicastro et al . 
 note that bian & gu ( 2007 ) suggested the nicastro et al . 
 eddington ratio threshold corresponds to an @xmath63 , if using [ o iii]@xmath645007 ( rather than x - ray ) luminosity to estimate the bolometric luminosity . 
 the @xmath65 of @xmath66 found for ngc 7590 using [ o iii ] luminosity is more in agreement with the nicastro et al . 
 ( 2003 ) predictions , suggesting that ngc 7590 is likely genuinely lack of a blr . 
 however , xmm images suggest a compton - thick obscuration to the nucleus of ngc 7590 , thus supports the scenario that the non - detection of hidden blr in this source could be attributed to heavy obscuration ( see shu et al . 
 2007 ) , and the intrinsic lack of blr is not necessarily required . 
 the _ xmm - newton _ spectral fitting of ngc 7590 requires an additional soft component , which was well modeled with an emission spectrum from collisionally - ionized diffuse gas ( the apec model in xspec ) . 
 the best - fit temperature for the soft thermal component is @xmath67 kev . 
 this value is consistent with @xmath68 kev found in nearby seyfert galaxies ( cappi et al . 
 2006 ) , but lower than the range of gas temperatures ( 0.60.8 kev ) found in liners ( gonz@xmath69lez - martin et al . 
 the inferred soft x - ray luminosity is @xmath70 @xmath50 . 
 if the soft x - ray emission is originated from gas heated by intense star formation activities , the implied star formation rate for ngc 7590 is @xmath14 1@xmath71 yr@xmath11 ( rovilos et al . 
 2009 ) , which is consistent with the estimate using its far - infrared luminosity ( kennicutt 1998 ) . in summary , 
 _ xmm - newton _ 
 observations reveal that the x - ray emission of ngc 7590 is dominated by an extended component and an off - nuclear ulx . 
 this indicates that its pre - identified `` unobscured '' nature is likely artificial . 
 due to the contamination from the ulx and the extended component , we are unable to isolate the nuclear x - ray emission for ngc 7590 , and the flux upper limit was given . 
 the derived relatively small @xmath54 ratio suggests that the galaxy likely has a heavily obscured nucleus , which could be confirmed with higher spatial resolution @xmath72 images . 
 future hard x - ray imaging telescopes ( i.e. , nustar , astro - h ) could also help by detecting the hard x - ray bump at @xmath14 20  30 kev of the compton - thick spectrum .

92,"production of superpartners at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the event rates observed in the recent cosmic ray data @xcite , and potentially in dark matter direct detection experiments @xcite , all may be linked to the composition of dark matter . 
 a well motivated class of candidate models that can be tested on all of these fronts arises when the dark matter is the lightest r - parity odd supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and has a substantial wino component . 
 however , even if the lsp is produced at the lhc at a relatively light mass , a discoverable signal at the lhc may be difficult unless colored superpartners such as the gluino , are light . 
 there are few top down models which generically imply an lsp that is dominantly wino with a light gluino . 
 the breaking of supersymmetry ( susy ) through a pure anomaly mediated contribution does predict an lsp that is a wino , but needs an extension to provide a consistent model . 
 string frameworks of interest which give rise to a light gluino and predict a wino lsp include those based on the fluxless sector of @xmath7 compactifications from which a realistic model of soft susy breaking has been constructed @xcite . 
 related models of soft breaking based on the heterotic string can also yield a light gluino with a wino - like lsp @xcite , and a light gluino / wino - like lsp system can also arise from gaugino mass non - universality in d - brane models of soft susy breaking @xcite .    that a wino - like lsp is consistent with the pamela satellite data with a mass of order 200 gev has been emphasized @xcite , and recent works have begun to study the implications of a light wino with a correspondingly light gluino @xcite . generally , for a pure wino , or wino - like dark matter candidate 
 , the predictions on the relic abundance can be in the vicinity of the wmap data @xcite . 
 relatively light wino - like dark matter can produce the correct relic density and have a thermal history provided it contains non - negligible bino and higgsino components in extended theories @xcite , while the pure wino can do so in a non - thermal paradigm due to the decay of heavy moduli @xcite ( for recent related work see @xcite ) . 
 the heavy moduli can add large additional post freeze - out entropy to the primordial particle density from the moduli decay into the susy sector . 
 this decay also leads to a release of winos which annihilate at a temperature much lower than freeze - out .    for the class of models we are interested in here , 
 the gluino mass is rather light , as dictated by the soft breaking of supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking , leading to large gluino production cross sections with subsequent decays of the gluinos via three - body decay chains . 
 thus a prominent lhc signal arises from multijet production . 
 some early susy discovery prospects in multijets at the lhc over a broad class of models have been given in @xcite@xcite ( for reviews see @xcite,@xcite ) . 
 distinctively , here we emphasize well motivated models that yield dark matter annihilation cross sections consistent with the recent pamela data , and also lead to a spectrum with a light gluino . 
 the associated production of gluinos and a wino - like lsp lead to a simultaneous probe of supersymmetry at colliders and in present dark matter experiments , where the gluino is linked to the chargino and neutralino through its dominant three body decay channels . 
 the analysis of electroweak gauginos at colliders with mass degeneracy between the lsp and chargino has been studied in great detail ( for early work see @xcite and for a recent analysis see @xcite ) where the soft decays of the chargino can lead to a wino lsp and a charged pion , giving rise to a displaced vertex of a track length of a few centimeters . 
 the organization of this paper is a follows : in section [ g2 ] we briefly review a soft breaking sector of interest which gives rise to a light wino and a light gluino and serves to illustrate the effects of the expected high jet multiplicity from the production of gluinos at the lhc . 
 we then discuss the numerical simulations that allow us to make contact between the theory and the data and enable a connection between the predictions for the lhc and to possible signals of dark matter . following this , in section [ lhcmodels ] 
 we analyze the early discovery prospects of such models at the lhc for benchmark models and also for a large collection of models . 
 the above is all carried out in the framework of the @xmath7 models with a pure wino lsp and a light gluino .    in section [ generalpredictions ] 
 we examine a larger class of models in the context of relic density and direct and indirect detection of dark matter . 
 we include models which deviate from a pure wino , but still have a substantial wino component . here , as before , the soft breaking of supersymmetry and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking dictate the mass of relatively light gluino in the models of interest . 
 we optimistically conclude in section [ conc ] . 
 the underlying framework we work in is described by @xmath8 supergravity . 
 we first consider the @xmath9 @xcite which has a generalized sector of soft susy breaking derived from both @xcite a tree level supergravity contribution and an anomalous contribution .. ] the soft parameters can be parametrized at the unification scale as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitino mass , @xmath14 is a universal scalar mass , @xmath15 are the gaugino masses , and @xmath16 are the tri - linear couplings of the third generation . here 
 the parameters @xmath17 are functions of the microscopic theory which are determined entirely from the effective supergravity model . 
 the soft parameters are well approximated by ( for the complete analytical expressions see @xcite ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 parametrizes gauge coupling corrections in the tree level sector of the gaugino masses . 
 the parameter @xmath22 arises as a consequence of the hidden sector potential which is responsible for tuning the cosmological constant to zero . 
 the terms entering for the tri - linears of the third generation are well approximated by @xmath23 up to small corrections in the normalized yukawas and the normalized volume @xmath24 of the @xmath7 manifold , the latter of which enters in the determination of the gravitino mass . 
 the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values is generically in the range @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both taken to arise from the quadratic term in the kahler potential , and are similar in magnitude . here 
 the largeness of the gravitino mass decouples the scalars while the gaugino masses are suppressed relative to the gravitino mass , where the suppression enters via the volume of hidden sector three cycles . 
 the physical values of the soft parameters are sensitive to the precise value of the unified gauge coupling and threshold corrections . 
 the largeness of the gravitino mass generically drives the @xmath26 term to be order @xmath28 for electroweak symmetry breaking , which in turn induces a relatively large self energy correction @xcite to the electroweak gaugino masses @xcite . 
 the models studied in reference @xcite did not have a solution of the @xmath26 problem , but simply assumed that @xmath26 and the associated soft breaking term @xmath29 arose from the quadratic term in the kahler potential . 
 when the issues of embedding the standard model in the @xmath7 manifold are fully understood it could happen that @xmath26 is small by symmetry arguments , e.g. u(1 ) charges force the bilinear term to vanish . then if @xmath26 was of the same order as @xmath30 there would be some higgsino mixture in the @xmath7 wino , so the theories would have a wino - like lsp instead of a pure wino one . in this paper 
 we use  @xmath31 to refer to the pure wino case of reference @xcite . if the theory developed to imply a wino - like lsp the results for describing 
 the pamela data and lhc predictions would change very little ; however predictions on dark matter direct detection would be considerably modified .      in this work 
 we have implemented the complete analytical expressions for soft breaking terms of the @xmath7-mssm into softsusy@xcite . 
 the analysis includes the gaugino mass threshold corrections @xcite with 2 loop scalar corrections , 2-loop rges for the higgs and gaugino masses , @xmath26 , and yukawa and gauge couplings @xcite . 
 branching fractions have been computed with susyhit @xcite and production of signal and backgrounds are generated with pythia @xcite and pgs @xcite with the level 1 ( l1 ) triggers designed to efficiently reproduce cms specifications @xcite ( for detailed discussions see e.g. @xcite ) . 
 signal and background have been simulated at @xmath32 in order to generalize our predictions for preliminary lhc runs and future operational center of mass energies . 
 specifically , sm backgrounds have been generated with qcd multi - jet production due to light quark flavors , heavy flavor jets ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , drell - yan , single @xmath35 production in association with quarks and gluons ( @xmath36 + jets / @xmath37 + jets ) , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 pair production resulting in multi - leptonic backgrounds . 
 laboriously , samples were generated at @xmath41 with up to 5  @xmath5 of luminosity . in pgs4 jets 
 are defined through a cluster - based algorithm which has a heavy flavor tagging efficiency based on the parametrizations of the cdf run ii tight / loose ( secondary ) vertex b - tagging algorithm @xcite . 
 the standard criteria for the discovery limit of new signals is that the susy signals should exceed either @xmath42 or 10 whichever is larger , i.e. , @xmath43 , were @xmath44 indicates the channel of interest . 
 the signature space of the models we probe has distinctive dark matter predictions . 
 the models we consider are dominated by dark matter annihilations into @xmath45 and can yield a significant flux of cosmic antimatter in the galactic halo ( for early work see @xcite ) . 
 the annihilation cross section receives an enhancement relative to other susy modes since it is s - wave and has a relative strength dictated by the su(2 ) gauge coupling and the wino component of the lsp . 
 the models are made consistent with the relic density constraints as will be discussed . 
 for the analysis of dark matter annihilation cross sections and their resultant fluxes we employ fragmentation functions from darksusy @xcite using pythia . in this work we also model cosmic fluxes with galprop v50.1p @xcite 
 in theories with wino lsps , the dominant lhc production modes are not strictly those from strongly produced susy . 
 the production modes of the wino ( @xmath46 ) and the lightest chargino ( @xmath47 ) are competitive with the gluino ( @xmath48 ) production and frequently are larger . however due to the small splittings ( a fraction of a gev ) between the wino and chargino the decay products here are soft . except for larger gluino masses , we find that most events that pass the triggers do indeed come from @xmath49 production , though as much as 30% of the events come from electroweak production . 
 thus the dominant production modes are @xmath50 $ ] . 
 the decays modes lead to rich jet and missing energy signatures with a sizeable number of leptons in the final state . 
 in particular the dominant decays are as follows : @xmath51 $ ] with secondary decays @xmath52 and @xmath53 with tertiary branchings of the produced standard model particles @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] . 
 the models are rather predictive as they typically require no more than 2 - 3 branchings to complete susy cascades resulting in lepton and jet signatures . 
 while this is a typical signature of susy in a generic model , it is actually a prediction of the wino branch of the @xmath7 model as electroweak symmetry breaking corners the viable parameter space and thus the viable signature space . 
 the decays of @xmath56 and their jet and lepton by - products will be very soft yet there can be radiation of gluon from the initial or final state partons that can generate a relatively hard jet . 
 thus one can look for a hard monojet and n - jet events with large missing energy as an early indication of the production of supersymmetric events at the lhc . in table ( [ parbench ] ) 
 we illustrate some typical spectra found in the @xmath7 models for @xmath57 ( precisely in the mass range pointed to by the recent pamela data [ see sec.([positrons ] ) ] along with the dominant branching ratio of the gluino given in table ( [ branch ] ) . 
 .benchmark models predicting a light gluino and a lsp that is a wino with a degenerate chargino with a light second neutralino ( which is mostly bino ) . 
 the last four columns carry units of gev . [ 
 cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ lhcdata ]    in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) ( left upper panel ) one observes that the models can produce detectable multi - jet signals even at @xmath58 tev for @xmath59 of integrated luminosity under the standard @xmath60 discovery reach criteria in the kinematic variable @xmath61 . in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) ( right upper panel ) 
 we show the large number of multijet signals . 
 the analysis shows that the model can produce a large excess in hadronic jets over the backgrounds . 
 the large jet multiplicity arises from the three body decay of the gluinos and from jets arising from initial state radiation . 
 we find the discovery limit is optimal for 4 - 5 jets with a lepton veto and large missing energy cut . 
 the lower right panel exhibits @xmath62 with larger luminosity . 
 the lower left panel shows the discovery reach for the same model with @xmath63 and @xmath60 can be reached with several hundred inverse picobarns of data . 
 having established that the highly constrained , and therefore predictive @xmath7 model can give rise to detectable signals of susy with early lhc data ( see also @xcite ) , we now extend the analysis to a larger region of the @xmath7 parameter space rather than focusing on a benchmark model . 
 we have performed a detailed scan of the parameter space of these models over the parameters discussed in section [ g2 ] , consistent with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking subject to the constraint that the wino mass is in the range ( 170 - 210 ) gev . 
 we uncover a large parameter space where the gluino can be relatively light in the @xmath7 model . 
 the majority of the models have a gluino in the mass range of 500 to 900 gev ( see fig.([figrat ] ) for the corresponding gaugino mass ratios ) . 
 lhc predictions with light gluino have been studied recently @xcite , but without considering the connection to the pamela data , which we pursue in the next section .    in table 
 ( [ lhcdata ] ) we display the relatively large total theoretical production cross section before cuts ( @xmath64 from gluino , neutralino , chargino production ) and the effective susy cross section @xmath65 ( cross section after the l1 triggers have been passed ) . 
 one observes that the l1 triggers are well optimized for these events as a large fraction of the susy cross section is maintained . 
 the substantial missing energy arises in many of the models from the prompt branching of the gluino into 2 jets and the lsp wino . 
 event rates at the lhc are shown in the 4-jet channel and the 2b channel with just 1 fb@xmath66 of integrated luminosity at @xmath58 tev along with the ratio of the signal to the square root of the background . 
 these models can be discovered very early with the lhc and can begin to be probed at @xmath67     figure ( [ fig3 ] ) displays the effective susy production cross section after cuts ( @xmath65 ) as a function of gluino mass at various center of mass energies . 
 the ( shaded ) colored regions are the necessary luminosity need for a @xmath68 excess in steps of 200 pb@xmath66 of integrated luminosity where we require at least 5 jets and large missing energy @xmath69 gev . 
 thus it is apparent from the analysis that nearly all the models can produce discoverable signals with low luminosity . 
 remarkably , we find that with only @xmath70 of data at @xmath71 10 tev , the models will produce large jet - based signals which can be discovered over the sm backgrounds over a part of the parameter space , even for gluinos as light as 550 gev with @xmath72 at @xmath73 tev . 
 models with wino - like lsps , and thus nearly degenerate charginos and neutralinos , are well known to be be difficult to study @xcite . 
 the chargino lifetime can be of order a centimeter , and the second heavier neutralino can even have order tens of gev splitting ( see table ( [ parbench ] ) for such theory motivated examples ) . 
 once a set of gluino candidates have been identified , an off - line analysis focused towards the study of the chargino and neutralino states in the gluino decay products will be necessary . 
 in this section we relax the tight constraints of the @xmath7 theory space and explore the possibility of an lsp which has a significant wino component (  wino - like "" ) , but may also have non - negligible bino and higgsino components . 
 one natural class of models where such an lsp is achieved are in grand unified models such as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 where the gut symmetry is broken by a non - singlet @xmath77 term leading to gaugino masses at the unification scale that are non - universal , i.e. , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . 
 such soft breaking mass terms can give rise to a wino - like lsp with a light gluino if the high scale values of the gaugino masses , @xmath30 and @xmath80 , are reduced relative to @xmath81 .      in a general setting , the relic density can be equal to the observed one with a wino - like or pure wino lsp due to the late decay of a modulus field . 
 such is possible in a universe that has a non - thermal cosmological history @xcite . 
 thus , for a single heavy modulus field @xmath82 , in the so - called instantaneous decay approximation one obtains a reheat temperature , @xmath83 , due to the decay @xmath84 by assuming all energy density of @xmath82 is transferred into radiation . 
 the modulus decays after freeze - out and the reheat temperature is @xmath85 , @xmath86 . 
 here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , where @xmath90 parametrizes deviations from the planck scale ( moduli couplings at ( much lower ) intermediate scales have been considered in @xcite ) . 
 for example , @xmath91 gives @xmath92 which may be interpreted as an effective string scale . under this assumption of non - thermal ( nt ) 
 production one has @xmath93 , where @xmath94 can be computed in the usual manner ( see i.e. @xcite ) . 
 for the s - wave dominated lsp interaction , we obtain @xmath95 , where we have used @xmath96 , and where @xmath97 . 
 a saturation of the error corridor from the wmap constraint on @xmath98 is then possible for a gravitino in the mass range @xmath99 tev . in the @xmath7 models specific calculations of the relic abundance from moduli decay 
 have been carried out @xcite giving a relic density , from a string based construction , a few times larger than the experimental value unless the gravitino mass is order 100 tev .    in greater generality , the nature of soft breaking and the cosmological history of the universe 
 may very well be closely tied together @xcite . on the other hand , in a non - thermal framework one can also approach the wmap constraint so long as @xmath83 does not spoil bbn constraints @xcite .    in a thermal paradigm the relic abundance of a wino - like lsp can also be brought in accord with the wmap data in the presence of residual abelian gauge factors that survive down to the susy scale and mix weakly with the mssm neutralinos leading to a co - annihilation enhancement @xcite in an otherwise depleted relic abundance from the large annihilations of the lsp . 
 this is to be contrasted with enhancements in the halo cross section , i.e. through a sommerfeld enhancement @xcite or through a breit - wigner enhancement @xcite or a boost in the flux via dark matter clumps @xcite . 
 thus predictions on the relic density consistent with the production of positrons in the halo are rather model dependant , but nevertheless can account for the proper relic abundance of dark matter in such models . 
 the data released by the pamela collaboration indicates a large excess in positron flux in the halo . for the case of models with mssm field content , 
 annihilations of the lsp into @xmath37 bosons are dominant possible sources of positrons and indeed the @xmath100 production provides the needed cross section in the halo to account for the pamela anomaly for a pure wino @xcite@xcite without any boost factor in the positron flux ( @xmath101 ) . 
 the pamela data can also be fit when the lsp has a non - negligible higgsino component @xcite with small boost ( clump ) factors in the positron flux @xmath102 . 
 figure ( [ figpam ] ) illustrates fits to the data for various neutralino masses with no boost factor in the positron flux . 
 the figure is meant to show that models with wino - like lsps which describe the pamela positron ratio should have masses in the range near ( 170 - 200 ) gev . 
 progress has been made towards a complete fit to both the pamela positron , antiproton data , and the fermi @xmath103 flux data using galprop @xcite and more exhaustive analyses are currently under way . 
 a lighter lsp could also produce the pamela signal with a different set of propagation parameters . 
 if other effects , such as small density fluctuations are included , the lsp mass range could cover slightly heavier masses . 
 the relative strength of the photon line spectrum arising from dark matter annihilations in the galaxy @xcite is highly sensitive to the gaugino content of the lsp @xcite@xcite . 
 thus with an essentially pure wino , as in the g@xmath104 models , @xmath105 , for a wino mass corresponding to the line energy of fig.([figdata2 ] ) . 
 such models provide promising probes for dark matter candidates with the fermi data @xcite in the central galaxy and from dwarf galaxies . in fig.([figdata2 ] ) we illustrate this effect for the recently released photon data @xcite . 
 the analysis shows that annihilations of a pure wino are not inconsistent with an isothermal profile ( which may be favoured by recent simulations including baryons @xcite ) . 
 such a constraint is highly dependent on the profile uncertainties . at present 
 , the pamela data can be described consistently with the fermi photon data and fig.([figdata2 ] ) shows that fermi is close to sensitivity needed to see a signal in the line source . 
 another probe of annihilating dark matter comes from the fermi analysis on dwarf galaxies @xcite . 
 the recently reported results show the strongest constraints are from ursa minor and draco implying a signal should be seen for wino masses below @xmath106 . 
 this constraint assumes a nfw dwarf density profile @xcite ( see however @xcite ) . 
 there presently is a rather appreciable uncertainty in the predicted flux from the dwarf galaxies due in part to the integration over the density ( squared ) source of dark matter @xcite,@xcite . for the case of the draco dwarf galaxy ref . 
 @xcite finds an uncertainty of a factor of 10 or more . 
 a more detailed analysis will help shed light on these constraints . 
 it would be premature to deduce that the constraints are ruling out models until the profile of the dwarf galaxies are better understood and the inclusion of more stars enters into the analyses . 
 a related indication of wino - like dark matter ( but not pure wino ) is that of an enhanced spin independent ( si ) cross section when the wino content is supplemented by non - negligible sources of higgsino and bino content . 
 the spin dependent cross section is also enhanced , and their contribution is not negligible , at least for xenon based targets . for the si interactions with admixtures of the above type one finds si cross sections in the interesting region of @xmath107 @xcite , ( for recent related work see @xcite ) . 
 for a pure wino , the tree level cross section involving the higgs exchanges vanish and loop corrections @xcite are not large enough to bring the cross section up in the region that is presently testable 
 . thus observation of a signal in cdms ii , xenon-100 ( or edelweiss and other related experiments ) would immediately exclude a pure wino lsp . 
 deviating from the pure wino by a few percent leads to a detectable ( si ) cross section . 
 for example , with soft breaking parameters @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , the lsp forms a _ wino - like eigenstate _ : @xmath110 , _ with both a large halo annihilation cross section , @xmath111 , and detectable si scattering cross sections , @xmath112 . _ specifically , one obtains the following : @xmath113 , and @xmath114 with @xmath115 . here 
 the lsp mass is @xmath116 and the gluino mass is very light @xmath117 . 
 such a model would produce discoverable jet signatures immediately at the lhc . 
 thus , this class of model produces positrons in the halo which describe the pamela data , and produces a spin independent scattering cross section within reach of the cdms and xenon experiments ( see : @xcite and @xcite for a similar emphasis ) . on the other hand 
 if xenon-100 sees no signal , and the pamela data turns over at higher energies , a pure wino remains a possible and well - motivated interpretation . 
 in this letter we have studied collider and dark matter implications within the setting of soft supersymmerty breaking based on string compactifications and in related models with non minimal gaugino sectors . 
 the implications of a pure wino and a wino - like lsp in association with the production of light gluinos at the lhc , along with a possible interpretation of dark matter annihilations as a cause for the rising positron ratio in pamela satellite data , all provide exciting possibilities for the early discovery of supersymmetry . 
 such a discovery will have strong implications for the underlying theory and for the nature of soft supersymmetry breaking , as well as for the cosmological history of the universe . 
 an underlying theory which can accommodate the positron excess , can produce testable event rates in direct detection experiments , and lead to testable signatures at the lhc due to the presence of light gluinos , all can arise with an lsp that has a substantial wino component . 
 in addition , the wino - like lsp can have a spin independent interaction cross section that can be rather large when a non - negligible higgsino component is present . 
 a theory of this kind provides a compelling candidate to explain the nature of dark matter , its relic density from re - heating , and its annihilations in the galaxy . 
 recent photon constraints from fermi on the above class of models are also analyzed and we have shown that there is a large region of parameter space where a wino - like lsp is consistent with the constraints . 
 the constraints are very sensitive to the gaugino content of the wavefunction of the lsp and to the assumed halo profile . 
 this parameter space accommodates light gluinos and therefore jets and missing energy signals that can be tested with early data at the lhc . 
 we have particularly emphasized , via specific models , a light gluino , and the importance of three - body decay chains which yield large jet multiplicities from the light gluino decays producing wino or wino - like lsps . 
 the resulting set of decays are strikingly simple and predictive with gaugino production controlling the event topologies . the nearly degenerate charginos and neutralinos arise from the three body decays of the gluino and 
 could be identified with a careful analysis after collecting a sample of gluino events . indeed 
 the models discussed here are ripe for studies at the lhc with low luminosities and at start up center of mass energies due to their large multi - jet event rates .

93,"in a series of recent papers  @xcite it has been shown that upon the introduction of perturbations , stable relativistic tori ( or thick accretion discs ) manifest a long - term oscillatory behaviour lasting for tens of orbital periods . when the average disc density is close to nuclear matter density , the associated changes in the mass - quadrupole moment make these objects promising sources of high - frequency , detectable gravitational radiation for ground - based interferometers and advanced resonant bar detectors , particularly for galactic systems . 
 this situation applies to astrophysical thick accretion discs formed following binary neutron star coalescence or the gravitational core collapse of a sufficiently massive star . 
 if the discs are instead composed of low - density material stripped from the secondary star in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , their oscillations could help explaining the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the spectra of x - ray binaries . 
 indeed , such qpos can be explained in terms of @xmath0-mode oscillations of a small - size torus orbiting around a stellar - mass black hole  @xcite . 
 the studies reported in the papers mentioned above have considered both schwarzschild and kerr black holes as well as constant and nonconstant ( power - law ) distributions of the specific angular momentum of the discs . 
 however , they have so far been limited to purely hydrodynamical matter models , neglecting a fundamental aspect of such objects , namely the existence of magnetic fields . 
 there is general agreement that magnetic fields are bound to play an important role in the dynamics of accretion discs orbiting around black holes 
 . they can be the source of viscous processes within the disc through mhd - turbulence  @xcite , as confirmed by the presence of the so called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( @xcite ) that regulates the accretion process by transferring angular momentum outwards . 
 in addition , the formation and collimation of the strong relativistic outflows or jets routinely observed in a variety of scales in astrophysics ( from micro - quasars to radio - galaxies and quasars ) is closely linked to the presence of magnetic fields . 
 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd hereafter ) numerical simulations provide the best approach for the investigation of the dynamics of relativistic , magnetized accretion discs under generic nonlinear conditions . in recent years 
 there have been important breakthroughs and a sustained level of activity in the modelling of such systems , as formulations of the grmhd equations in forms suitable for numerical work have become available . 
 this has been naturally followed by their implementation in state - of - the - art numerical codes developed by a number of groups ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) many of which have been applied to the investigation of issues such as the mri in accretion discs and jet formation . 
 moreover , very recently  @xcite has derived an analytic solution for an axisymmetric , stationary torus with constant distribution of specific angular momentum and a toroidal magnetic field configuration that generalizes to the relativistic regime a previous newtonian solution found by @xcite . 
 such equilibrium solution can be used not only as a test for grmhd codes in strong gravity , but also as initial data for numerical studies of the dynamics of magnetized tori when subject to small perturbations . 
 the latter is , indeed , the main purpose of the present paper .    in this way we aim at investigating if and how the dynamics of such objects changes when the influence of a toroidal magnetic field is taken into account . 
 we discuss the implications of our findings on the qpos observed in lmxbs with a black hole candidate , assessing the validity of the model proposed by  @xcite in a more general context . 
 the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the equilibrium solution found by  @xcite for a stationary torus with a toroidal magnetic field orbiting around a black hole . 
 the mathematical framework we use for the formulation of the grmhd equations and for their implementation in our numerical code is discussed in section 3 , while in section 4 we describe the approach we follow for the numerical solution of the grmhd equations . 
 section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the initial models considered , with the results being presented in section 6 . 
 finally , section 7 summarizes the paper and our main findings . 
 we adopt a geometrized system of units extended to electromagnetic quantities by setting @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vacuum permittivity . 
 greek indices run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 . 
 the initial configurations we consider can be considered as the mhd extensions to of the stationary hydrodynamical solutions of thick discs orbiting around a black hole described by @xcite , @xcite and are built using the analytic solution suggested recently by  @xcite . 
 the basic equations that are solved to construct such initial models are the continuity equation @xmath4 for the rest - mass density @xmath5 , the conservation of energy - momentum @xmath6 , and maxwell s equation @xmath7 , where the operator @xmath8 is the covariant derivative with respect to the spacetime four - metric and @xmath9 is the dual of the faraday tensor defined as @xmath10 in this expression @xmath11 is the fluid four - velocity and @xmath12 is the magnetic field measured by an observer comoving with the fluid . as usual in ideal relativistic mhd ( _ i.e. _ , for a plasma having infinite conductivity ) , the stress - energy tensor @xmath13 is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the metric coefficients , @xmath0 is the ( thermal ) pressure , @xmath16 the specific enthalpy , and @xmath17 . 
 the equilibrium equations are then solved to build stationary and axisymmetric fluid configurations with a toroidal magnetic field distribution in the tori and a constant distribution of the specific angular momentum in the equatorial plane . 
 the main difference of our solution with that of @xcite is that we employ a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath18 for the fluid , where @xmath19 is the polytropic constant and @xmath20 is the adiabatic index . 
 such an eos has a well - defined physical meaning and differs from the one used by @xcite , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fluid enthalpy , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .    by imposing the condition of axisymmetry and stationarity in a spherical coordinate system ( _ i.e. , _ 
 @xmath25 ) , the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions are given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . 
 the angular velocity appearing in ( [ bernoulli ] ) is defined as @xmath31 the specific angular momentum is given by @xmath32 and the components of the magnetic field are @xmath33    following  @xcite , we consider the following eos for the magnetic pressure @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath24 are constants , and which essentially amounts to confining the magnetic field to the interior of the torus . using this relation , we can integrate eq . 
 ( [ bernoulli ] ) , which in the case of constant specific angular momentum yields @xmath36 where the potential @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 . 
 note that in general there will be two radial locations at which @xmath39 equals the keplerian specific angular momentum . 
 the innermost of these radii represents the location of the `` cusp '' of the torus , while the outermost the `` centre '' . 
 when a magnetic field is present , the position of the centre does not necessarily correspond with that of the pressure maximum , as in the purely hydrodynamical case .    in order to solve eq . 
 ( [ bernoulli ] ) a number of parameters are needed to define the initial model , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the ratio of the magnetic - to - gas pressure at the centre of the torus , @xmath41 . 
 thus , using the definition of @xmath42 , we obtain the rest - mass density at the centre of the torus from the following expression : @xmath43= 0 . 
 \label{eq : motion2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    finally , the equilibrium equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) can be solved to obtain the distribution of all relevant magnetohydrodynamic quantities inside the torus ( @xcite ) . 
 as mentioned in the introduction , there has been intense work in recent years on formulations of the grmhd equations suitable for numerical approaches  @xcite . 
 we here follow the approach laid out in  @xcite and adopt the @xmath44 formulation of general relativity in which the 4-dimensional spacetime is foliated into a set of non - intersecting spacelike hypersurfaces . 
 the @xmath44 line element of the metric then reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the 3metric induced on each spacelike slice , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the so - called lapse function and shift vector , respectively .    under the ideal mhd condition , maxwell s equations @xmath49 reduce to the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field @xmath50 together with the induction equation for the evolution of the magnetic field @xmath51\ } , \label{eq : evb}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being respectively the spatial components of the velocity and of the magnetic field , as measured by the eulerian observer associated to the @xmath44 splitting .    following  @xcite , the conservation equations for the energy - momentum tensor given by eq . 
 ( [ stress - tensor ] ) together with the continuity equation and the induction equation for the magnetic field can be written as a first - order , flux - conservative , hyperbolic system . 
 the state vector and the vector of fluxes of the fundamental grmhd system of equations read @xmath56 where @xmath57 . 
 the state vector @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 , \label{state_vector}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with the definitions @xmath60 and where @xmath37 is the lorentz factor of the fluid . the `` fluxes '' @xmath61 in eqs . ( 
 [ eq : fundsystem ] ) have instead explicit components given by @xmath62 , \label{flux2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] while the `` source '' terms @xmath63 are @xmath64,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the christoffel symbols for either a schwarzschild or kerr black - hole spacetime . 
 note that the following fundamental relations hold between the four components of the magnetic field in the comoving frame , @xmath12 , and the three vector components @xmath55 measured by the eulerian observer @xmath67 finally , the modulus of the magnetic field can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 . 
 casting the system of evolution equations in flux - conservative , hyperbolic form allows us to take advantage of high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) methods for their numerical solution . 
 the hyperbolic structure of those equations and the associated spectral decomposition of the flux - vector jacobians , needed for their numerical solution with riemann solvers , is given in  @xcite . 
 [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     we complete our discussion of the spectral properties of these oscillating discs , by showing in fig . [ fig6 ] the psd for model @xmath70 , which , we recall , represents a torus orbiting around a kerr black hole with spin @xmath71 . as for the previous spectra 
 , the dashed line corresponds to the unmagnetized version of model @xmath70 and is included for reference . 
 overall , the features observed in a kerr background are very similar to those found for models in the schwarzschild case . 
 also in this case , in fact , the fundamental mode , its first overtones and the nonlinear harmonics are clearly identified and no evidence appears of new modes related to the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .    as a final remark we note that the @xmath72 ratio among the different @xmath0 modes has a relevance also in a wider context . 
 we recall , in fact , that among the several models proposed to explain the qpos observed in lmxbs containing a black hole candidate , the one suggested by  @xcite is particularly simple and is based on the single assumption that the accretion disc around the black hole terminates with a sub - keplerian part , _ 
 i.e _ a torus of small size 
 . a key point of this model is the evidence that in these objects the frequencies of the fundamental mode and the first overtone are in the @xmath72 harmonic sequence in a very wide space of parameter . 
 the simulations presented here further increase this space , extending it also to the case of magnetized tori and thus promoting the validity of this model for qpos to a more general and realistic scenario .      as pointed out by  @xcite the oscillating behavior of perturbed accretion tori 
 is responsible for significant changes of their mass quadrupole moment . as a result 
 , these changes determine the emission of potentially detectable gravitational radiation if the tori are compact and dense enough . 
 this could be the case if the tori are produced via binary neutron star mergers or via gravitational collapse of the central core of massive stars . in this section , 
 we extend the analysis of  @xcite for unmagnetized discs and investigate the gravitational - wave emission from constant angular momentum magnetized tori orbiting around black holes . 
 although more sophisticated approaches involving perturbative techniques around black holes can be employed to study the gravitational - wave emission from these tori ( @xcite ) , we here resort to the simpler and less expensive use of the newtonian quadrupole approximation ( @xcite ) , which has been suitably modified to account for the presence of a magnetic field , as done by  @xcite . 
 in particular , the quadrupole wave amplitude @xmath73 , and which is the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment , is computed through the `` stress formula '' ( @xcite ) @xmath74   \ ; , \nonumber \\\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the gravitational potential , and is approximated at the second post - newtonian order from the metric function @xmath79 .     as fig . 
 [ fig5 ] but for model @xmath70.,width=288 ]    figure  [ fig7 ] shows a spectral comparison between the designed strain sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detectors virgo and ligo , and the logarithm of the power spectrum @xmath80 of the gravitational - wave signals for models @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath70 ( similar graphs are obtained also for the other models ) . 
 note that all of the sensitivity curves displayed in this figure assume an optimally incident wave in position and polarization ( as obtained by setting the beam - pattern function of the detector to one ) , and that the sources are assumed to be located at a distance of 10 kpc .     of the wave signal for models 
 @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath70 and the strain sensitivity of ligo ( dashed line ) , virgo ( long - dashed line ) . 
 [ fig7 ] , width=288 ]    from fig . 
 [ fig7 ] it is clear that all our models lie well above the sensitivity curves of the detectors for galactic sources and also that there are no significant differences in the power spectra as the magnetic field strenght is increased . interestingly , however , the signal from a torus orbiting around a kerr black hole is clearly distinguishable from the one around a schwarzschild black hole . besides having a fundamental mode at higher frequencies , in fact , 
 also the amplitude is about one order of magnitude larger as a result of it being closer to the horizon and with a comparatively larger central density . 
 as expected from the similarities in the dynamics , the signal - to - noise of these magnetized models is very similar to one of the corresponding unmagnetized tori , and we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion . 
 we have presented and discussed the results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of magnetized relativistic axisymmetric tori orbiting in the background spacetime of either schwarzschild or kerr black holes . 
 the tori , which satisfy a polytropic equation of state and have a constant distribution of the specific angular momentum , have been built with a purely toroidal magnetic field component . 
 the self - gravity of the discs has been neglected and , as the models considered are all marginally stable to accretion , the minute accretion of mass and angular momentum through the cusp is not sufficient to affect the background black hole metric . 
 the use of equilibrium solutions for magnetized tori around black holes has allowed us to study their oscillation properties when these are excited through the introduction of small perturbations . 
 in particular , by considering a representative sample of initial models with magnetic - field strengths that ranged from @xmath83 g up to equipartition , and grmhd evolutions over 100 orbital periods , we have studied the dynamics of these discs and how this is affected by a magnetic field . 
 overall , we have found the behaviour of the magnetized tori to be very similar to the one shown by purely hydrodynamical tori ( @xcite ) . as in the hydrodynamical case , in fact 
 , the introduction of perturbations triggers quasi - periodic oscillations lasting tens of orbital periods , with amplitudes that are modified only slightly by the small loss of matter across the cusp . 
 the absence of an inital poloidal magnetic field has prevented the development of the magneto - rotational instability , which could influence the oscillation properties and thus alter our conclusions ( @xcite ) . 
 determining whether this is actually the case will be the focus of a future work , where a more generic magnetic field configuration will be considered . 
 as for unmagnetized tori , the spectral distribution of the eigenfrequencies shows the presence of a fundamental @xmath0-mode and of a series of overtones in a harmonic ratio @xmath1 . 
 the analogy with purely hydrodynamical simulations extends also to the nonlinear harmonics in the spectra and that are the consequence of the nonlinear coupling among modes , ( in particular the @xmath84 mode and of its first overtone @xmath85 ) . 
 also for them we have found a behaviour which is essentially identical to that found in unmagnetized discs . in summary , 
 no new modes have been revealed by our simulations , and in particular no modes which can be associated uniquely to the presence of a magnetic field . 
 nevertheless , the influence of the magnetic field is evident when considering the absolute values of the eigenfrequencies , which are shifted differentially to higher frequencies as the strength for the magnetic field is increased , with an overall relative change which is @xmath86 for a magnetic field near equipartition .    besides confirming the unmagnetized results , the persistence of the @xmath72 ratio among the different @xmath0 modes also has an important consequence . 
 it allows , in fact , to extend to a more general and realistic scenario the validity of the qpo model presented by  @xcite and @xcite , and which explains the qpos observed in the x - ray luminosity of lmxbs containing a black hole candidate with the quasi - periodic oscillations of small tori near the black hole . 
 the evidence that this harmonic ratio is preserved even in the presence of toroidal magnetic fields , provides the model with additional robustness .    when sufficiently massive and compact , the oscillations of these tori are responsible for an intense emission of gravitational waves and using the newtonian quadrupole formula , conveniently modified to account for the magnetic terms in the stress - energy tensor , we have computed the gravitational radiation associated with the oscillatory behaviour . 
 overall , we have found that for galactic sources these systems could be detected as they lie well within the sensitivity curves of ground - based gravitational - wave interferometers .    as a concluding remark 
 we note that our discussion here has been limited to tori with magnetic fields whose pressure is at most comparable with the gas pressure , _ i.e. _ , @xmath87 . 
 the reason behind this choice is that while in equilibrium , the magnetized tori with a purely toroidal magnetic field are not necessarily stable . 
 rather , indications coming both perturbative calculations and from nonlinear simulations , suggest that these tori could be dynamically unstable for sufficiently strong magnetic fields . 
 the results of these investigations will be presented in a forthcoming paper  ( @xcite ) .

94,"since the mid-70 s there has been a growing theoretical interest in the _ s - f _ ( or _ s - d _ ) model @xcite . 
 the model works for materials which exhibit _ local - moment magnetism _ : for magnetic semiconductors like the europium chalcogenides eux ( x = o , s , se , te ) @xcite and for metallic local - moment systems such as gd , tb , and dy @xcite . in the local - moment magnets , the electronic and the magnetic properties 
 are caused by different groups of electrons . whereas the electronic properties like electrical conductivity are borne by itinerant electrons in rather broad bands , e.g. _ 
 5d _ for gd , the magnetism is due to a strongly localized partially filled _ 4f_-shell . in the case of gd and 
 eu compounds the _ 4f_-shell is exactly half - filled and , because of hund s rules , has its maximal magnetic moment of @xmath0 . 
 many characteristics of the local - moment systems may be explained by a correlation between the localized magnetic states and the itinerant electrons . in the _ s - f _ model 
 this correlation is represented by an intra - atomic exchange interaction . 
 the difference between the _ s - f _ model and the well - known _ 
 kondo lattice model _ 
 @xcite is that in the former the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic , favouring parallel alignment of itinerant electrons and local - moments , whereas in latter it is antiferromagnetic . 
 that is why the _ s - f _ model has been recently more and more often referred to as the _ ferromagnetic kondo lattice model _ @xcite . 
 the second aspect of this paper is that of reduced dimensionality . 
 magnetic phenomena at surfaces and in thin films attract broad attention both theoretically and experimentally due to the question of phase transitions and the variation of magnetic and electronic properties in dimensionally reduced systems @xcite . 
 one of the most remarkable examples of the outstanding magnetic properties at surfaces is the existence of magnetically ordered surfaces at temperatures where the bulk material is paramagnetic . 
 this effect has been first documented for gd(0001 ) surfaces by weller _ 
 _ @xcite and since then been measured by different groups using a wide range of experimental techniques @xcite . in these experiments for the difference between the curie temperature at the surface , @xmath1 , and the curie temperature of bulk gd , @xmath2 , values between 17k @xcite and some 60k 
 @xcite have been reported . 
 succeeding the results for gd , tb also was found to have a higher surface curie temperature , relative to the bulk @xcite . 
 contrary to the groups cited above , donath _ et al . _ 
 @xcite , using spin - resolved photoemission did not find any indication for an enhanced surface curie temperature of gd(0001 ) surfaces . 
 other controversially discussed surface properties of gd include the temperature dependent behaviour of a gd(0001 ) surface state @xcite which is supposed to play an important role in the interplay between electronic structure and magnetism 
 . a thorough account on the surface magnetism of the lanthanides has been recently given by dowben _ 
 _ @xcite . 
 it is not only the dimensionally reduced gd which is of interest here , even bulk gd is far from being completely understood . in an earlier study nolting _ 
 _ @xcite have predicted that the a priori non - magnetic ( _ 5d_,_6s_)-conduction and valence bands should exhibit a marked non - uniform magnetic response at different positions in the brillouin zone and for different subbands .. weakly correlated ( _ s_-like ) dispersions show a stoner - like @xmath3-dependence of the exchange splitting . on the other hand , 
 stronger correlated ( _ d_-like ) dispersions split below @xmath4 into four branches , two for each spin direction . 
 their @xmath3-dependence mainly concerns the spectral weights of the quasiparticle peaks and not so much the energy positions . 
 consequently , an exchange caused splitting remains even for @xmath5 . 
 this may be the reason for the fact that the experimental situation is controversial . 
 _ @xcite found a @xmath3-dependent spin splitting of occupied conduction electron states , which collapses in a stoner - like fashion for @xmath6 . from photoemission experiments , 
 li _ et al . 
 _ @xcite conclude that the exchange splitting must be wave - vector dependent , collapsing for some @xmath7 values , while for other no collapse occurs as a function of increasing temperature . 
 this fairly complicated temperature behaviour in the bulk - material must be expected for gd - films , too . 
 it is not at all a trivial task to perform an electronic structure calculation for a ferromagnetic local - moment film in such a manner as to realistically incorporate correlation effects . in a previous paper @xcite 
 we proposed a simplified model which allowed us to exactly calculate the electronic structure of a model film in the limiting case of ferromagnetic saturation and empty conduction band , @xmath8 . 
 this case is applicable to a film of a ferromagnetic semiconductor such as euo , eus at @xmath9 . 
 its significance arises from the fact that all relevant correlation effects which are found or expected to occur at finite band occupations and arbitrary temperatures @xcite , do already appear in this rigorously tractable special case @xcite .    in this paper 
 we extend the @xmath9 special case to finite temperatures . as a result 
 we will calculate the electronic structure of a local - moment film with a single - electron in an otherwise empty conduction band within the whole temperature range from @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in the next section we present the model and define the corresponding many - body problem . 
 subsequently the model is evaluated in two steps , in section [ subsec : elsub ] for the electronic subsystem , and in section [ subsec : lms ] for the local - moment system . 
 section [ sec : results ] is devoted to a detailed discussion of the results obtained for different film thicknesses and various exchange couplings and temperatures . 
 comprehensive conclusions with an outlook on the possible application of the model to real substances and on the evaluation of temperature dependent surface states in section [ sec : summary ] complete the paper . 
 we investigate a film consisting of @xmath11 equivalent layers parallel to the surface of the film . 
 each lattice site of the film is indicated by a greek letter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 denoting the layer index and a latin letter @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 numbering the sites within a given layer . 
 each layer possesses two - dimensional translational symmetry . 
 accordingly , the thermodynamic average of any site dependent operator @xmath19 depends only on the layer index @xmath12 : @xmath20 the complete _ s - f _ model hamiltonian @xmath21 consists of three parts . 
 the first @xmath22 describes the itinerant conduction electrons as _ s_-electrons . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively the creation and annihilation operators of an electron with the spin @xmath25 at the lattice site @xmath26 . 
 @xmath27 are the hopping integrals . 
 each lattice site @xmath26 is occupied by a localized magnetic moment , represented by a spin operator @xmath28 . 
 these localized moments are exchange coupled expressed by the heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the exchange integrals . 
 the problem with the simple heisenberg model in the form ( [ h_f ] ) is that due to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite there is no solution showing collective magnetic order at finite temperature , @xmath31 . to avoid this obstacle 
 we have chosen an extended hamiltonian for the localized moments , @xmath32 which additionally to the heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath33 features a single - ion anisotropy term @xmath34 . 
 @xmath35 is the according anisotropy constant , which is typically smaller by some orders of magnitude than the heisenberg exchange interaction , @xmath36 .    the distinguishing feature of the _ s - f _ model is an intra - atomic exchange between the conduction electrons and the localized _ f_-spins , @xmath37 here 
 , @xmath38 is the _ s - f _ exchange interaction and @xmath39 is the pauli spin operator of the conduction band electrons . for the materials we are interested in 
 the _ s - f _ coupling is positive ( @xmath40 ) . in the case where @xmath41 the model hamiltonian ( [ sf_ham ] ) is that of the so - called _ 
 kondo lattice_. using the second - quantized form of @xmath39 and the abbreviations @xmath42 the _ s - f _ hamiltonian can be written as @xmath43 the most decisive part of the _ s - f _ hamiltonian ( [ h_sf ] ) is the second term , which describes spin exchange processes between the conduction electrons ( [ h_s ] ) and the localized moments ( [ h_f ] ) .    in general , the alignment of the localized moments will be influenced by the _ s - f _ interaction , which can mediate an indirect interaction ( rkky ) via the occupied conduction band @xcite . however , here we are interested in the electronic quasiparticle spectrum of a ferromagnetic semiconductor according to a simple test electron in an otherwise empty conduction band . in this case 
 , the localized spin state can not be affected by the _ s - f _ interaction . 
 furthermore , one knows from experiment that typical heisenberg exchange integrals are smaller by some orders of magnitudes than their _ s - f _ counterparts . in this respect 
 , it seems appropriate to neglect the heisenberg exchange integrals for the calculation of the electronic properties of the system . 
 accordingly , the hamiltonian ( [ sf_ham ] ) can be split into an electronic , @xmath44 , and a magnetic part , @xmath45 , which can be solved separately . 
 starting from the hamiltonian of the electronic subsystem , @xmath46 all physical relevant information of the system can be derived from the retarded single - electron green function : @xmath47_+ \right\rangle.\end{aligned}\ ] ] here and in what follows @xmath48_+$ ] ( @xmath48_-$ ] ) is the anticommutator ( commutator ) . 
 conform to the two - dimensional translational symmetry , we perform a fourier transformation within the layers of the film , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of sites per layer , @xmath7 is an in - plane wavevector from the first 2d - brillouin zone of the layers and @xmath51 represents the in - plane part of the position vector , . from eq.([green_gen_k ] ) we get the local spectral density by @xmath52 which is directly related to observable quantities within angle and spin resolved direct and inverse photoemission experiments . 
 finally , the wave - vector summation of @xmath53 yields the layer - dependent ( local ) quasiparticle density of states : @xmath54 in the following discussion all results will be interpreted in terms of the spectral density ( [ spectral ] ) and the local density of states ( [ ldos ] ) . 
 for the solution of the many - body problem posed by eq . 
 ( [ h _ * ] ) we write down the equation of motion of the single - electron green function ( [ green_gen ] ) @xmath55_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \rangle\!\rangle_e,\ ] ] where @xmath56 . the formal solution of eq . 
 ( [ eom_gen ] ) can be found by introducing the self - energy @xmath57 , @xmath58_- ;    c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e =    \sum_{m\mu } m^{\alpha\mu}_{im\sigma}(e ) g^{\mu\beta}_{mj\sigma}(e),\ ] ] which contains all information about the correlations between the conduction band and localized moments . after combining eqs . 
 ( [ eom_gen ] ) and ( [ self_gen ] ) and performing a two - dimensional fourier transform we see that the formal solution of eq . 
 ( [ eom_gen ] ) is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the ( @xmath61 ) identity matrix and where the matrices @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 have as elements the layer - dependent functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively . 
 to explicitly get the self - energy in eq . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) we evaluate the green function @xmath68_- ;    c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e =    - \frac{j}{2 } \left ( z_{\sigma } { \it \gamma}^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma }    + f^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma } \right).\ ] ] here the two higher green functions , @xmath69 originate form the two terms of the _ s - f _ hamiltonian ( [ h_sf ] ) and will be referred to as the _ ising _ and the _ spin - flip _ function , respectively . 
 considering the equations of motion for these two green functions we encounter the two higher green functions @xmath70_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \rangle\!\rangle_e$ ] and @xmath71_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \rangle\!\rangle_e$ ] . since we consider an empty conduction band the thermodynamic average in the green functions has to be computed with the electron vacuum state @xmath72 . from the definition of the _ s - f _ hamiltonian ( [ h_sf ] ) 
 we then see that @xmath73 and , accordingly , @xmath74_-    c_{k\gamma\sigma};c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e    & \stackrel{n\rightarrow 0}{\longrightarrow } & 0 , \\ 
 \left\langle\!\left\langle \left[s^{-\sigma}_{i\alpha},{\cal h}_{sf}\right]_-    c_{k\gamma-\sigma};c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e    & \stackrel{n\rightarrow 0}{\longrightarrow } & 0 .\end{aligned}\ ] ] hence , for the equations of motion of the ising and the spin - flip function we get @xmath75_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma }    \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e \\[2ex ]    \lefteqn{\label{eom_f_gen }    \sum_{m\mu } \left(e\delta^{\gamma\mu}_{km}-t^{\gamma\mu}_{km } \right )    f^{\alpha\mu\beta}_{imj\sigma}(e ) } \nonumber \\ & = &    \left\langle\!\left\langle s^{-\sigma}_{i\alpha } \left [ c_{k\gamma-\sigma } ,    { \cal h}_{sf } \right]_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma }    \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e .\end{aligned}\ ] ] on the right - hand side of these equations appear further higher green functions which prevent a direct solution and require an approximative treatment . 
 the treatment is different for the non - diagonal terms , @xmath76 and for the diagonal terms , @xmath77 . in the first case we use a self - consistent so - called _ self - energy approach _ which results in a decoupling of the equations of motion . for the diagonal terms , @xmath77 , 
 this approach is replaced by a moment technique which takes the local correlations better into account . 
 [ [ non - diagonal - terms - ialphanekgamma ] ] non - diagonal terms @xmath76 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the definition of the self - energy ( [ self_gen ] ) formally corresponds to the substitution @xmath78_- \longrightarrow    \sum_{m\mu } m^{\alpha\mu}_{im\sigma}(e ) c_{m\mu\sigma}\ ] ] within the brackets of the green function . 
 the inspection of the spectral decomposition of the two functions in eq . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) reveals that both , @xmath79_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \rangle\!\rangle_e$ ] and @xmath80 , have the same pole structure and can differ only by the spectral weights of their poles . the equality of both sides in eq . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) is installed by the self - energy components @xmath57 . 
 inspecting now the spectral representations of the two green functions @xmath81_-;c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \rangle\!\rangle_e$ ] and @xmath82 we notice that the additional spin operator @xmath83 selects for both only those poles of the original green functions without spin operator which are connected with a spin - flip of the electron . 
 hence , the poles of these two functions build subset of the poles of the two green functions from eq . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) and are , therefore , identical to each other . 
 again , only the weights of the poles can differ . 
 in analogy to eqs . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) and ( [ subst_se ] ) we now propose to use the plausible ansatz @xmath84_-;c^+_{j\beta\sigma }     \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e } \nonumber \\    & & \approx \sum_{m\mu } m^{\gamma\mu}_{km-\sigma}(e )    \left\langle\!\left\langle s^{-\sigma}_{i\alpha } c_{m\mu-\sigma } ;    c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e.\end{aligned}\ ] ] a similar reasoning can be used for : @xmath85_-;c^+_{j\beta\sigma }     \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e } \nonumber \\    & & \approx \sum_{m\mu } m^{\gamma\mu}_{km\sigma}(e )    \left\langle\!\left\langle s^z_{i\alpha } c_{m\mu\sigma } ;    c^+_{j\beta\sigma } \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e , \end{aligned}\ ] ] with the difference that here the additional spin operator @xmath86 does not change the original pole structure but merely modifies the spectral weights of the poles . on the right - hand sides of eqs . 
 ( [ sea1 ] ) and ( [ sea2 ] ) we find the already known spin - flip and ising function , respectively . 
 hence , for @xmath76 , the eqs . 
 ( [ eom_gen ] ) , ( [ c_hsf ] ) , ( [ eom_ga_gen ] ) , ( [ eom_f_gen ] ) , ( [ sea1 ] ) , and ( [ sea2 ] ) build a closed system .    [ [ diagonal - elements - ialphakgamma ] ] diagonal elements @xmath77 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we start with the explicit evaluation of the higher green functions on the right - hand sides of eqs . 
 ( [ eom_ga_gen ] ) and ( [ eom_f_gen ] ) . for eq . 
 ( [ eom_f_gen ] ) we get , for @xmath77 , @xmath87_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma }    \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e } \nonumber \\    & & = \frac{j}{2 } \left ( z_{\sigma }      \dot{f}^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma}(e ) -       \ddot{f}^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma}(e ) \right),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have abbreviated    [ def_high_f ] @xmath88    the analogous evaluation of the higher green function in eq.([eom_ga_gen ] ) does not require any further higher green functions , because it can be expressed in terms of already known green functions : @xmath89_- ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma }      \rangle\!\rangle_e \ ! + \ ! z_{\sigma 
 }    \langle\!\langle s^{-\sigma}_{i\alpha } [    c_{i\alpha-\sigma } , { \cal h}_{sf } ] _ - ; c^+_{j\beta\sigma }    \rangle\!\rangle_e } \nonumber \\    & = & \frac{j\hslash}{2 } (     { \it \gamma}^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma}(e ) + z_{\sigma }    f^{\alpha\alpha\beta}_{iij\sigma}(e ) - 
 z_{\sigma}\hslash s(s+1 )    g^{\alpha\beta}_{ij\sigma}(e ) ) . 
 \nonumber \\\end{aligned}\ ] ] as eq . 
 ( [ eq_high_f ] ) , the above relation is still exact . to get a close system of equations we are left with the determination of the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 . both fulfil exact relations which will be used to derive satisfying approximations . for spin @xmath92 
 we find for all temperatures :    [ lc_s_onehalf ] @xmath93    on the other hand , in the case of ferromagnetic saturation , @xmath94 , it holds for arbitrary spin :    [ lc_t_zero ] @xmath95    the exact limiting cases ( [ lc_s_onehalf ] ) and ( [ lc_t_zero ] ) suggest the general structures :    [ gen_struc ] @xmath96    for the five green functions of the type @xmath97 in eqs . 
 ( [ gen_struc ] ) we can calculate the spectral moments , @xmath98_+ \right\rangle_{t=0 } , \ ] ] where @xmath99 . 
 because of the equivalent relation @xmath100 the moments can be used to fix the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 in eqs . 
 ( [ gen_struc ] ) . after tedious but straightforward calculations , 
 we get @xmath103 the coefficients are determined by 
 _ f_-spin correlation functions , which will be determined at a later stage .    the eqs . 
 ( [ eom_gen ] ) , ( [ c_hsf ] ) , ( [ eom_ga_gen ] ) , ( [ eom_f_gen ] ) , ( [ sea1])([eq_high_f ] ) , ( [ eq_high_ga ] ) , ( [ gen_struc ] ) , and ( [ coeff ] ) represent a closed system , which can be solved self - consistently . before proceeding we assume that the self - energy from eq . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) is a local entity @xmath104 the reason for the @xmath7 independence can be traced back to the neglect of magnon energies @xcite . 
 the restriction to the diagonal elements in the greek indices denoting the layers is in that sense the transfer of the @xmath7 independence in the case of three dimensions @xcite to the film geometries discussed in this paper . 
 furthermore one can show that the assumption ( [ local_self ] ) is not necessary for the following calculations but merely drastically simplifies them . 
 we can now use eqs.([sea1])([eq_high_f ] ) , ( [ eq_high_ga ] ) , ( [ gen_struc ] ) , and ( [ coeff ] ) to evaluate the ising and the spin - flip functions in eqs . 
 ( [ eom_ga_gen ] ) and ( [ eom_f_gen ] ) . as the result 
 we get the fourier transformed ising and spin - flip functions . according to eq . 
 ( [ c_hsf ] ) we can restrict our attention to the diagonal elements @xmath105 and @xmath106 . 
 after subsequent @xmath107-summation we eventually get , using eqs.([form_sol ] ) and ( [ local_self ] ) :    [ eq_sum ] @xmath108    where we have introduced @xmath109 the set of equations ( [ eq_sum ] ) can be solved to express the sums @xmath110 and @xmath111 in terms of the single - electron green function @xmath65 . 
 however , by inspecting eqs . 
 ( [ eq_sum ] ) we see that these expressions will still contain the layer and spin - dependent self - energy @xmath112 .    to solve this problem we combine eqs . 
 ( [ self_gen ] ) and ( [ c_hsf ] ) and get , after fourier transformation : @xmath113 combining this equation with the results obtained for @xmath110 and @xmath111 from eqs . 
 ( [ eq_sum ] ) we eventually get an implicit set of equations for the layer and spin - dependent electronic self - energy : @xmath114 where the numerator and the denominator , respectively , are given by    [ num_den ] @xmath115    the implicit set of equations ( [ small_self ] ) and ( [ num_den ] ) now enables us to self - consistently evaluate the self - energy of the system provided that the _ f_-spin correlation functions from eqs.([coeff ] ) are known . 
 these will be evaluated in the next section . 
 the system of localized _ 
 f_-moments is described by the extended heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ h_f_ex ] ) which we write down again for convenience : @xmath116 here we want to stress once more that the single - ion anisotropy constant @xmath35 is small compared to the heisenberg exchange interaction , @xmath36 . by defining the magnon green function 
 @xmath117 we can calculate the _ 
 f_-spin correlation functions by evaluating the equation of motion @xmath118_- ; s^-_{j\beta }          \right\rangle\!\right\rangle_e .\ ] ] the evaluation of this equation of motion involves the decoupling of the higher green functions on its right - hand side , originating from the heisenberg term . 
 @xmath33 , and the anisotropy term , @xmath34 , using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and a decoupling proposed by lines @xcite , respectively . 
 the details of the calculation can be found in a previous paper @xcite . for brevity 
 we restrict ourselves to present here only the results . for the layer - dependent magnetizations of the _ f_-spin system 
 we get @xmath119 where @xmath120 where , again , @xmath50 is the number of sites per layer and @xmath121 . 
 the summation @xmath122 in eq . 
 ( [ varphi ] ) runs over the @xmath11 poles @xmath123 of the green function @xmath124 and the @xmath125 is the weight of the @xmath14th pole in the diagonal element of the green function @xmath126 . the poles and the weights can be calculated from the solution of eq . 
 ( [ eom_green_heis ] ) : @xmath127 with @xmath128 the @xmath129 come from the decoupling of the higher green function on the right - hand side of eq . 
 ( [ eom_green_heis ] ) which originates from the anisotropy hamiltonian @xmath130 according to lines @xcite and are given by : @xmath131    having obtained the layer - dependent magnetizations ( [ s_z ] ) and the @xmath132 we can now express all the other _ 
 f_-spin correlation functions appearing in eqs . 
 ( [ coeff ] ) via the relations    [ rel_coeff ] @xmath133    and the general spin - operator equality @xmath134    mediated by eqs . 
 ( [ coeff ] ) , ( [ small_self ] ) , and ( [ num_den ] ) , the _ 
 f_-spin correlation functions contain the whole temperature dependence of the electronic subsystem ( [ h _ * ] ) . 
 we have evaluated our theory for a film with simple cubic ( s.c . ) 
 structure consisting of @xmath11 layers parallel to the ( 100)-plane of the crystal . the electron hopping and the heisenberg exchange integrals shall be restricted within a tight - binding approximation to nearest neighbour coupling , @xmath135 respectively . here 
 @xmath136 denotes the relative positions of nearest neighbours , both within the same layer , for s.c.(100 ) : @xmath137 . 
 @xmath138 is the hopping between the layers @xmath12 and @xmath139 and @xmath140 is the exchange interaction within the layer @xmath12 . for the following discussion , 
 furthermore the hopping integrals and the exchange interaction have been assumed to be uniform within the whole film , @xmath141 where @xmath142 should not be mixed up with the _ s - f _ exchange interaction @xmath38 . for explicit values 
 we choose @xmath143ev , @xmath144ev , and the single - ion anisotropy @xmath145 . 
 before we can start calculating the electronic excitation spectra , we first have to evaluate the local - moment system considered in sec . 
 [ subsec : lms ] . 
 = 0.83    = 0.83    for example , fig . 
 [ fig:1 ] shows the layer - dependent magnetizations of a 20-layer s.c.(100 ) film as a function of temperature . as for all other film thicknesses the layer - dependent magnetizations @xmath146 increase from the surface layers ( @xmath147 ) towards the center layers ( @xmath148 ) of the film . 
 the inset of fig . 
 [ fig:1 ] displays dependence of the curie temperature on the film thickness @xmath11 . 
 the complete set of _ 
 f_-spin correlation functions according to eqs . 
 ( [ s_z ] ) , ( [ varphi ] ) , ( [ rel_coeff ] ) , and ( [ spin_op_rel ] ) calculated for the center layer of the 20-layer film can be seen in fig . 
 [ fig:2 ] . 
 = 0.55      we discuss our results in terms of the spectral density @xmath149 , defined in eq . 
 ( [ spectral ] ) , and the local quasiparticle density of states , eq . 
 ( [ ldos ] ) . 
 we start our discussion of the temperature dependent electronic bandstructure with a special limiting case which gives us an insight into the underlying physics of the problem . 
 the special limiting case of ferromagnetic saturation , @xmath9 , and empty conduction band , @xmath8 , is exactly solvable , both , for the bulk material @xcite and for film geometries @xcite . the limiting case , therefore , provides a good testing ground for the theory for finite temperatures presented in sec . 
 [ subsec : elsub ] . 
 it turns out that for @xmath9 the @xmath150-spectrum is rather simple , since a @xmath151-electron has no chance to exchange its spin with the ferromagnetically saturated localized _ 
 f_-spin system . 
 the quasiparticle bandstructure is therefore identical to the free bloch dispersion , only rigidly shifted by a constant energy amount of @xmath152 , due to the first ising - like term in the _ s - f _ hamiltonian ( [ h_sf ] ) . 
 [ fig:3 ] shows the spin-@xmath153 spectral density of a s.c.-(100)-monolayer for the special case of ferromagnetic saturation , @xmath9 , for different _ s - f _ interactions @xmath38 . for @xmath154 
 the spectral density represents a @xmath155-function located at the point of the free two - dimensional bloch dispersion . for small _ s - f _ exchange coupling , @xmath40 , a slight deformation of the original bloch dispersion sets in and the quasiparticle peaks get a finite width indicating a finite lifetime . for intermediate and strong couplings the spectral density splits into two parts corresponding to two different spin exchange processes between the excited spin-@xmath153 electron and the localized _ f_-spin system . 
 the higher energetic part of the spectrum represents a polarization of the immediate spin neighbourhood of the electron due to a repeated emission and reabsorption of magnons . 
 the result is a polaron - like quasiparticle called the _ magnetic polaron_. the low - energetic part of the spectrum is a scattering band which corresponds to the simple emission of a magnon by the spin-@xmath153 electron , which is necessarily connected with a spin - flip of the electron @xcite . 
 = 0.9    from the spectral density of fig . 
 [ fig:3 ] we get , using eq . 
 ( [ ldos ] ) , the local quasiparticle density of states @xmath156 of a monolayer , displayed in fig . 
 [ fig:4 ] . here 
 we see that the splitting of the spectral density discussed above transfers itself to the quasiparticle density of states as a gap for @xmath157 . as for the spectral density , 
 the density of states of the spin-@xmath151 electron is only rigidly shifted and therefore not displayed 
 .    however , this does not hold any longer for finite temperatures , @xmath31 . fig . 
 [ fig:5 ] exhibits the density of states of a s.c.-(100)-monolayer for different _ s - f _ interactions and different temperatures . 
 the dotted lines represent the case of vanishing _ s - f _ exchange , @xmath154 , where spin-@xmath153 and spin-@xmath151 spectra are equal . 
 since the electrons are not coupled to the local - moment system , we also have no temperature dependence . for finite _ s - f _ interaction we see from fig . 
 [ fig:4 ] that in the spin-@xmath153 density of states spectral weight is transferred from the high - energetic polaron peak to the low - energetic scattering peak . 
 to explain this effect we have to consider the elementary processes which build the spectrum . 
 the low - energetic scattering peak of the spin-@xmath153 electron consists of two elementary processes . 
 = 0.87    = 0.8    because of finite deviation of the _ f_-spin system from saturation for @xmath31 , the @xmath153-electron has a finite probability of entering the local frame as spin-@xmath151 electron . 
 this probability is zero for @xmath158 ( @xmath9 ) and increases with increasing temperature . on the other hand , 
 the spin-@xmath153 electron can first emit a magnon and by that process reverse its spin , becoming a spin-@xmath151 electron in the external frame of coordinates . 
 the spectral weight produced by the first elementary process reduces the spectral weight of the high - energetic polaron peak therefore shifting spectral weight from the high - energetic polaron peaks towards the low - energetic scattering peak .    for the spin-@xmath151 electron we see from fig . 
 [ fig:5 ] that for finite temperatures an additional peak rises at the high - energetic side of the spectra with increasing temperature . 
 we can explain this effect by the spin-@xmath151 electron absorbing a magnon and subsequently , as spin-@xmath153 electron forming a polaron . here 
 the magnon absorption by a spin-@xmath151 electron is equivalent to the magnon emission by a spin-@xmath153 electron . in the case of ferromagnetic saturation 
 the system does not contain any magnons , which is the reason why there is no scattering peak in the spin-@xmath151 spectrum at @xmath9 . as a result of the shifting of spectral weights towards lower energies for the spin-@xmath153 electron and towards higher energies for the spin-@xmath151 electron the densities of states for the two spin directions approach each other with increasing temperature . 
 = 0.95    in the limiting case of @xmath159 the system has eventually lost its ability to distinct between the two possible spin directions of the test electron because of the loss of magnetization of the underlying local - moment system , @xmath160 . 
 hence as for the case of vanishing _ 
 interaction for @xmath161 the density of states of states of the spin-@xmath153 electron equals that of the spin-@xmath151 electron . 
 another feature which can be seen from fig . 
 [ fig:5 ] is that the positions of the four quasiparticle subbands , two for each spin direction , do not change with temperature .    to further discuss the temperature effects we present with figs . 
 [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] the spectral density and the local density of states , respectively , of a s.c.-(100 ) double - layer ( @xmath162 ) for @xmath163 and different temperatures . 
 again we see that the spectra for the two spin directions approach each other for @xmath6 . 
 another feature which can already be observed in fig . 
 [ fig:5 ] is that the increase of temperature results in the narrowing of the subbands . for the case of intermediate coupling , 
 @xmath163 , according to figs . 
 [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] this band narrowing results in the opening of a gap between the scattering and the polaron band with increasing temperature . 
 this temperature enhanced band splitting has already been found for the three - dimensional case @xcite . 
 it can be explained for the spin-@xmath151 electron by the fact that for propagating in its own low - energetic subband it needs to find an appropriate lattice site . 
 =    in the case of ferromagnetic saturation there is no restriction for the propagation of the spin-@xmath151 electrons since spin - flip processes are impossible . with increasing temperature 
 there is an increasing deviation of the local moments resulting in the possible magnon absorption by the spin-@xmath151 electron and subsequent changing to the higher energetic polaron subband . 
 hence , the spin-@xmath151 electron , to propagate in its own subband needs to move further distances with increasing temperature resulting in a reduced effective hopping and in a decreased bandwidth . 
 =    in addition to the discussed temperature effects , figs .  [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] exhibit a typical two - peak structure which is caused by the coupling of the two layers . 
 this two - peak structure is replaced in the case of a film consisting of @xmath11 equivalent layers by an @xmath11-peak structure . 
 generally , the spectra of the discussed local - moment films are characterised by an interplay between correlation ( @xmath38 ) , temperature effects , and geometry of the film . 
 [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] display results for the local density of states and the layer - dependent spectral density of a 20-layer s.c.-(100)-film . 
 additionally to the dependence on the _ s - f _ exchange interaction and the temperature dependence we notice that the spectral density and the density of states show a typical layer - dependence due to the broken translational symmetry at the surfaces of the film @xcite . for the centre layers ( @xmath148 ) of the 20-layer - film we see from fig . 
 [ fig:8 ] that the local density of states of the spin-@xmath151 electron at @xmath9 has already become pretty similar to the well - known tight - binding density of states of the three - dimensional s.c . 
 lattice whereas the density of states of the surface layers ( @xmath147 ) exhibits the characteristic semi - elliptic profile . 
 we have investigated the electronic quasiparticle bandstructure of a ferromagnetic semiconductor film . 
 a single test electron ( _ s_-band ) is coupled by an intra - atomic _ s - f _ inter - band exchange to a system of localized _ 4f_-moments . 
 that may be regarded as a proper model description for euo and eus . 
 our approach uses a moment - conserving decoupling procedure for suitable defined green functions . 
 the fact that our theory evolves continuously from the exactly solvable limiting case of ferromagnetic saturation @xcite gives it a certain trustworthiness . 
 the exchange coupling of the conduction electron to the local - moment system gives rise to a correlation induced splitting of the quasiparticle spectra . 
 a polaron part may be interpreted as a repeated emission and reabsorption of magnons by the conduction electron resulting in a new quasiparticle , the magnetic polaron . 
 a rather broad scattering peak is due to a simple magnon emission or absorption by the conduction electron . 
 this pronounced splitting depends on the actual value of the exchange interaction @xmath38 . for small values of @xmath38 
 only a renormalization of the one - electron energy occurs resulting in a deformation of the free bloch dispersion . for higher values of @xmath38 , 
 the mentioned splitting of the spectra into polaron part and scattering part sets in . 
 we intend to apply the presented model to study the temperature dependent electronic structure of euo and eus films . 
 therefore the electronic part of the hamiltonian ( [ h_s ] ) and the _ s - f _ exchange interaction ( [ h_sf_orig ] ) have to be modified to include the multiband aspect of real substances 
 . this will be done by substituting the tight - binding bandstructure ( [ tb_hopp ] ) by a realistic one taken from a bandstructure calculation . 
 another highly interesting field which we want to use our theory for is the evaluation of the temperature dependence of surface states . in a previous paper 
 we have calculated surface states for the special case of @xmath9 and @xmath8 by modifying the hopping in the vicinity of the surface @xcite . 
 the extension of these calculations to finite temperatures promises to give an understanding of recent experimental results concerning the temperature dependence of electronic states on surfaces of rare earths .

95,"ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions produce dense matter which is expected to form at sufficiently high energy densities a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons , the quark gluon plasma . 
 a necessary condition for such a phase transition is local equilibrium which might be achievable through rescattering of produced particles . 
 hints for thermalization can most easily identified by studying the observables as function of centrality . 
 the high @xmath1 pion production is expected to be dominated by hard parton scattering but has recently been shown to be also explainable by a thermal model with hydrodynamic expansion . 
 the comparison of the wa98 @xmath2 data with hydrodynamic models provides constraints on the partition of excitation energy in terms of temperature and an average flow velocity . 
 such a finite thermalized system without any external pressure will necessarily expand and the thermal pressure will generate collective motion which will be reflected in the momentum spectra of the final hadrons . 
 thus a part of the thermal excitation energy will be converted into collective motion of the hadrons . 
 there seem to be qualitative changes in the behaviour of heavy - ion reactions once a certain system size is attained . 
 strangeness production is enhanced in s+s reactions compared to p+p , but seems to saturate for even larger nuclei@xcite . 
 recent results from the wa98 experiment@xcite show significant change of the shape of the @xmath2 @xmath1 spectrum in peripheral pb+pb collisions compared to p+p data . however , from semi - central pb+pb reactions with about 50 participating nucleons up to the most central reactions the shape remains unchanged . in the present analysis 
 the centrality has been selected with the transverse energy @xmath3 measured in the calorimeter mirac . 
 [ scaling ] shows the scaling behaviour of the charged particle multiplicity @xmath4 with the number of participants @xmath5 . 
 it can be seen that @xmath4 follows a power law with the number of participants . 
 the extracted exponent from the data is @xmath6 . on the bottom part of fig . 
 [ scaling ] the same analysis performed with venus 4.12 @xcite is displayed . while the simulation result also obeys roughly a power law scaling , the agreement is not as good , and the scaling exponent appears to be significantly larger than that obtained from the experimental data . 
 the neutral meson spectra are mainly influenced by thermal and chemical freeze - out in the final state . in the analysis of central reactions of pb+pb at 158 @xmath0gev 
 it is seen that both predictions of perturbative qcd @xcite and hydrodynamical parameterizations @xcite can describe the measured neutral pion spectra very well . 
 it is particularly astonishing to observe that on the one hand the pqcd calculation gives a good description also at relatively low momenta while on the other hand the hydrodynamical parameterization would yield a sizable contribution even at very high momenta . 
 [ hydro]a shows a comparison of the neutral pion spectra to a fit of a hydrodynamical parameterization including transverse flow and resonance decays @xcite . using the default gaussian profile the best fit 
 is obtained with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . 
 [ hydro]b shows the best fit parameters as a filled circle  the corresponding @xmath9 contour is also shown . 
 the figure also contains the @xmath10 allowed region from the @xmath11 dependence of the transverse radii extracted by negative pion interferometry with the wa98 negative tracking arm @xcite . 
 the interferometry constraints are very similar to those given in @xcite  they favour relatively large transverse flow velocities 
 . such large velocities are only compatible with the neutral pion spectra , if one assumes a very different spatial profile 
 . however , this would result in rather low temperatures , thus these parameters are very sensitive to the used profile@xcite . 
 if the initial state of the evolution is azimuthally asymmetric , as in semi - central heavy - ion collisions , this property will be reflected in the azimuthal asymmetry of the final state particle distributions . 
 the strength of the collective flow will yield information on the nuclear equation of state during the expansion . 
 collective flow development follows the time evolution of pressure gradients in the hot , dense matter . 
 thus , collective flow can serve as a probe to provide information on the initial state and to which extent the reaction zone might me thermalized . in particular , the formation of a quark gluon plasma during the early stages of the collision is expected to result in reduced pressure gradients due to a softer nuclear equation of state which results in a reduced collective motion@xcite .      fig . 
 [ flowcent ] shows the centrality dependence of the directed flow in terms of the average transverse momentum @xmath12 . for protons the maximum directed flow 
 is observed in reactions with intermediate centrality . 
 the corresponding impact parameter of @xmath13@xcite results twice as large as observed for ags energies@xcite . 
 since the observed @xmath14 of pions is positive it indicates that the pions are preferentially emitted away from the target spectators , this is called anti - flow@xcite . 
 the rapidity dependence of directed flow is given in fig . 
 [ flowy ] . 
 in addition , pion data measured with the tracking arm in the wa98 experiment@xcite at midrapidity and data near midrapidity measured by the na49 collaboration@xcite are shown . 
 the maximum flow is observed in the fragmentation regions , while it rapidly decreases near midrapidity . 
 the data follow a gaussian distribution .    hence for a complete description of the rapidity distribution of the collective flow the formerly used slope at midrapidity ( e.g. @xmath15 ) is not sufficient . 
 it is more reasonable to use the three parameters of the gaussian distribution to describe the data . 
 the peak position reflects the beam momentum , the peak height gives the strength of the flow and the width of the distribution provides information on how much the participants and the spectators are involved in the collectivity .

96,"colloidal particles dissolved in a nematic solvent experience long - ranged interactions  @xcite . 
 these effective interactions are generated by the distortions of the liquid crystal director around the particles and result in their clustering and self - organization  @xcite . upon approaching and at the nematic - isotropic transition , the solvent forms nematic and isotropic domains , which leads to an additional interaction of the particles with the interface between the two phases  @xcite . 
 the resultant morphology of the network formed by the particles in colloid - liquid crystal composites is very sensitive to this interaction  @xcite . 
 in fact , colloidal particles can be captured by the nematic - isotropic interface and even dragged by a _ moving _ 
 interface  @xcite . 
 this enables one to manipulate tiny particles in suspension , which in a more general context is of technological importance for manufacturing of @xmath0-papers and electrophoretic displays  @xcite , separation of bacterial species and living cells  @xcite , trapping of dna and polymer particles  @xcite , as well as growth of photonic crystals  @xcite . 
 the structures of self - assembled colloid layers at _ free _ surfaces of nematic films can be tuned by their thickness  @xcite . 
 recent experiments of dragging colloidal particles by nematic - isotropic interfaces  @xcite demonstrated that a single colloidal particle is attracted by the interface . 
 this conclusion is in accordance with theoretical results obtained by minimizing the corresponding landau - de gennes free energy  @xcite . 
 the resulting force on the particle is non - monotonic and is roughly proportional to the particle radius . 
 experimental results  @xcite also suggested that the particles captured by the interface interact with each other differently than in the pure nematic or isotropic phase , e.g. , the particle - particle interaction depends on the interfacial curvature ; particles which interact only weakly in the bulk can segregate and form two - dimensional clusters once they are captured by the interface ( see fig . 
 [ fig : experiment ] ) . 
 the appearance of additional interface induced features in the interaction between colloidal particles can be expected from analogous phenomena at interfaces of simple fluids  @xcite which , however , still pose unresolved challenges in understanding  @xcite . in liquid crystals the situation is even more complicated . 
 the director deformations extend into the nematic phase , i.  e. , in addition to interfacial energies , the bulk elasticity contributes to the total free energy of the system . 
 the effective surface tension ( provided it can be introduced in the first place ) depends on the orientation of the director , which in turn varies along the interface . 
 the boundary conditions for the director at the particle surfaces give rise to topological defects accompanying the particles . in order to minimize the free energy associated with the director distortions as well as the free energy of the defect cores , the defects often merge with the isotropic phase  @xcite or with each other . 
 the combination of the above - mentioned effects enriches the phenomena significantly but complicates their theoretical understanding enormously : expressions for the director field , the free energy , or force - distance profiles can hardly be obtained analytically . 
 numerical calculations are also not straightforward because the interfacial width and the size of the defect cores are normally much smaller that the size of the colloidal particle , so that there are several rather different length - scales involved 
 . therefore significant computational efforts involving finite - element methods with adaptive meshes are required to address even static problems  @xcite .    in the following 
 we study the interaction of two long parallel cylindrical colloids trapped at a ( initially ) flat nematic - isotropic interface . 
 we find that their effective interaction is rather complex : the force - distance profiles can exhibit jumps and hysteresis upon approach or separation . 
 the particles can either repel or attract each other depending on the material parameters and the geometry . 
 finally , we propose a simple effective pair potential which can be exploited to study clustering and self - organization of colloids at ni interfaces . 
 two identical colloidal particles , each of which we take to be a long cylinder of radius @xmath1 with the symmetry axis parallel to the @xmath2 axis , are immersed into a nematic liquid crystal at a separation @xmath3 , see fig . 
 [ fig : geometry ] . 
 the nematic order parameter tensor at the boundaries is fixed in a such a way that without the colloids a flat nematic - isotropic interface is formed at @xmath4 . 
 the order parameter at the top wall is fixed to zero ; the absolute value of the order parameter at the bottom wall is fixed to the bulk order parameter of the nematic phase at two - phase coexistence . 
 the director orientation at the bottom wall is also fixed and corresponds to the preferred director anchoring at the nematic - isotropic interface , i.e. , parallel or perpendicular to the interface . 
 the axes of the particles are positioned at @xmath5 . in the course of the free energy minimization @xmath6 adjusts itself such that that the @xmath7component of the force exerted on the particles vanishes . 
 the system is characterized by the landau - de gennes free energy  @xcite @xmath8 \label{eq : nem_free_en},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where summation over repeated indices is implied and the comma indicates the spatial derivative . the positive constants @xmath9 are assumed to be temperature independent , and @xmath10 is the supercooling temperature of the isotropic phase . 
 the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related to the frank - oseen elastic constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the bulk nematic order parameter . 
 the sign of @xmath12 determines the preferred orientation of the director at the nematic - isotropic interface . 
 @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) favors planar ( perpendicular ) anchoring . 
 we introduce the dimensionless temperature @xmath18 . 
 the bulk nematic phase is stable for @xmath19 with a degree of orientational order given by @xmath20 ; @xmath21 . 
 we consider both rigid homeotropic and finite anchoring boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . in the latter case 
 the surface free energy density is taken as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the anchoring coefficient and @xmath24 is the preferred tensor order parameter at the colloid surface with @xmath25 as the unit vector along the easy axis direction .    for the constants entering the free energy density ( eq . 
 ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) ) we use typical values for a nematic compound 5cb  @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . 
 the choices for @xmath12 will be given below . 
 the nematic - isotropic transition temperature for 5cb is @xmath31 . at coexistence the nematic coherence length ( 
 i.e. , the thickness of the nematic - isotropic interface ) is @xmath32 which sets the smallest length - scale of our description . 
 the equilibrium distribution of the tensor order parameter @xmath33 is obtained by minimizing the free energy functional  ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) numerically using finite elements with adaptive meshing . 
 the area @xmath34 is triangulated and the functions @xmath33 are linearly interpolated within each triangle . 
 for this case we chose the anisotropy of the elastic constants as @xmath35 , favoring director alignment parallel to the ni interface and in the plane @xmath36 . 
 we use rigid homeotropic boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . upon minimizing the free energy we have identified two stable orientational configurations . at sufficiently large separations 
 @xmath3 both colloids are accompanied by a defect of strength @xmath37 ( fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](b ) ) . 
 if the particles move closer , the two defects merge and form a single , but rather extended , defect positioned between the colloids ( fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](a ) ) . 
 we have also observed three metastable configurations . 
 here either one of the defects , fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](c ) , or even both defects , fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](d ) and ( e ) , merge with the isotropic phase : the system is trying to reduce its free energy by annihilating the defects . 
 however , the interface has to bend and almost wrap the particles in order to reach the defects . 
 this of course increases the interfacial energy , which is roughly proportional to the area of the interface . for small separations , among the metastable configurations only the one shown in fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](c ) is possible : due to strong anchoring at the particle surfaces the nematic phase forms a bridge between the particles , preventing the isotropic phase from reaching also the second defect . for larger separations , 
 the isotropic phase can extend partially around the colloids and merge with the second defect . 
 this can occur asymmetrically , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](d ) , or symmetrically , see fig . 
 [ fig : config_planar](e ) . 
 the effective pair potential @xmath38 defined as the free energy per length of the colloidal particles is presented in fig .  [ fig : energy_planar ] . in all cases 
 the particles repel each other . the branch of @xmath38 which corresponds to the _ stable _ configurations , reveals practically no breaks in slope , even though at @xmath39 the director field around the particles changes abruptly between the configurations ( a ) and ( b ) . 
 however , if one of the metastable configurations is present in the system , transitions between different branches can occur giving rise to jumps and hysteresis in the force - distance curves upon particle approach / separation . 
 the choice @xmath40 for the anisotropy of the elastic constants favors director alignment perpendicular to the ni interface in the plane @xmath36 . in this case 
 we have found only two , stable configurations . 
 the first one , containing a defect , is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : config_hom](a ) 
 . it occurs at small separations , where the nematic bridge between the particles forces the director to be parallel to the interface . 
 the other configuration has no defects , because the nematic bridge with director orientation parallel to the interface disappears and the defect merges with the isotropic phase . 
 the corresponding effective potential @xmath38 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : energy_hom ] . as in the previous case , 
 the particles repel each other at small separations where there are large director distortions in the inter - particle region . 
 however , contrary to the case with planar anchoring , there is a strong attraction between the particles for @xmath41 , where the configuration with the defect is stable . 
 the branch without the defect results in weak repulsion , as for planar anchoring . 
 minimization of the free energy is a computationally expensive task , which can not be used , for example , to calculate the forces on the particles each time their positions are advanced using molecular dynamics or monte - carlo algorithms for their kinetics . 
 use of effective potentials is a typical solution to this problem . in order to find such an appropriate potential 
 we have calculated the free energy per unit length for particles of different radii , @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 . 
 since colloids are rather small , the finite director anchoring at the particle surfaces has to be taken into account . 
 we have used a value appropriate for 5cb on a polymer surface  @xcite , @xmath44 ; for this energy the dimensionless anchoring parameter @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath46 . 
 minimization results for both planar and homeotropic anchoring of the director at the interface are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . 
 the strong repulsion close to contact ( @xmath47 ) has become smoother for planar and disappeared for homeotropic anchoring at the interface , due to the finite director anchoring at the colloid surfaces . 
 it turns out that in both cases the following shape of the potential fits the numerical data very well : @xmath48 , & 0 \le d \le d_c \\ u(\infty ) + u_0 \bigl ( \exp   \left [ -\alpha \left ( { d}/{\xi }   \right)^{-\beta } \right ] - 1\bigr ) , & d > 
 d_c , \end{array } \right . \label{eq : fit}\ ] ] where @xmath49 are ( positive ) fitting parameters . 
 the first part of the potential ( @xmath50 ) describes a simple harmonic - type attraction between the particles , which we observed for the _ homeotropic _ anchoring ; for _ planar _ interfacial anchoring @xmath51 . in the case of homeotropic anchoring @xmath52 
 is a critical distance at which the defect annihilates ( see figs . 
 [ fig : config_hom ] and [ fig : energy_hom ] ) . 
 we have no analytical support for the functional form of the effective potential ( [ eq : fit ] ) . 
 however , qualitatively , the effective interaction of the colloidal particles in a bulk nematic phase is known to exhibit a power - law decay at large distances  @xcite . in our case , 
 the leading term of the expansion for @xmath53 is indeed @xmath54 . on the other hand , if two colloids are sufficientlly close , so that the regions where the _ order parameter _ changes from their surface to the bulk value start to overlap , and where the defects ( if present ) interact with each other and the particles  @xcite , the functional form of the potential changes . normally , the distortions of the order parameter relax exponentially ( similar to the variations of the order parameter through the nematic - isotropic interface ) resulting in an exponentially varying strength of the interaction . 
 this is also captured qualitatively by the potential given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : fit ] ) .    the fitting curves are also shown in fig . 
 [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . for planar anchoring @xmath55 ; for homeotropic anchoring @xmath56 , i.  e. , in both cases the interaction potential is long - ranged . in case of homeotropic anchoring there is a critical size of colloidal particles ( of the order of interfacial width ) below which the discontinuous structural transition between the configurations with and without the defect disappears . 
 similar phenomena , named capillary bridging , can be observed in granular materials , liquid crystals , and binary mixtures  @xcite . in all cases , 
 one of the phases ( otherwise metastable in the bulk ) condenses out and forms a bridge between the particles . 
 this transition is discontinuous and ends in a critical point for small particle radii . in our case , the nematic phase located between the isotropic phase and the defect forms a bridge between the particles and results in their attraction . 
 in conclusion , within the landau - de gennes formalism we have studied the effective pair interaction between two cylindrical parallel colloids trapped at the nematic - isotropic interface . 
 this pairwise interparticle force depends sensitively on the radii of colloids , the orientation of the director at the ni interface , and the anchoring strength , i.e. , the nematic elasticity is an essential ingredient of the interaction . 
 the formation or annihilation of defects influences the effective pair potential 
 . it also changes the repulsive character of the interaction at large separations to an attractive one at intermediate or small separations . 
 therefore , one should expect that many - body interactions are relevant to describe collective colloidal ordering at the interface . 
 another implication of our work is that the interface is able to rearrange the nucleation centers of , for example , phase - separating polymer network and help to design composite materials of extraordinary properties .",0.296272496812269,0.11336032388663901,0.626706063747406,0.24468439268597503,0.08459214501510501,0.59430992603302,0.24125363088790802,0.06738868832731601,0.567856132984161,0
97,"a fundamental theoretical challenge in strongly correlated systems lies in understanding the behavior of frustrated quantum magnets , whose properties often bear little resemblance to those of their classical counterparts . in the most exotic scenario , 
 quantum fluctuations are sufficiently strong to disorder the system even at zero temperature , and a spin liquid ground state emerges . 
 historically , anderson originally suggested that the spin-1/2 heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet may realize such a quantum - disordered ground state.@xcite it is now recognized that with only nearest - neighbor exchange the true ground state on the triangular lattice is the magnetically ordered @xmath0 phase , though the order is significantly diminished relative to the classical state.@xcite it is conceivable , then , that a spin liquid may arise with not too drastic perturbations to the model , and the triangular lattice has thus remained a prominent setting in the search for two - dimensional spin liquids . 
 recent experiments on the spin-1/2 anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet  stimulated renewed interest in possible spin - liquid phases proximate to the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model.@xcite this material is accurately modeled by an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian supplemented by a weak  interaction.@xcite although long - range spiral order develops at temperatures @xmath1k , the dynamical structure factor measured via neutron scattering exhibits `` critical '' power laws at intermediate energies , both in the ordered phase and in a range of temperatures above @xmath2 . 
 this unusual power law behavior in the excitation spectrum is highly suggestive of spinon deconfinement that is characteristic of spin liquids . 
 a variety of theoretical approaches have been employed to capture spin liquids on the triangular lattice . 
 kalmeyer and laughlin exploited a mapping between the spin-1/2 heisenberg model and hard - core bosons in a magnetic field to obtain a `` chiral '' spin liquid which breaks time - reversal symmetry.@xcite their arguments were subsequently reformulated by yang _ et al_.,@xcite who arrived at the chiral spin liquid by fermionizing the spins using chern - simons flux attachment@xcite and expanding around a `` flux - smeared '' mean - field state . using a slave - boson representation of the spin operators , sachdev explored an sp(@xmath3 ) generalization of the heisenberg model , and in the large-@xmath3 limit obtained a z@xmath4 spin liquid ground state , which breaks no symmetries.@xcite the z@xmath4 spin liquid was later realized microscopically in a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice.@xcite finally , a large class of spin liquids was studied by zhou and wen using a slave fermion representation of the spins.@xcite whereas excitations in both the chiral and z@xmath4 spin liquids are gapped , the slave fermion mean - field approach can give rise to so called `` algebraic spin liquids '' , which admit _ gapless _ spin excitations and power - law spin correlations .    in this paper 
 we pursue an alternate approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet , and use vortex duality to attack the problem coming from the easy - plane regime . 
 duality has been a powerful tool for exploring unconventional phases such as valence bond solids and spin liquids in quantum spin systems,@xcite as well as complex charge - ordered states in bosonic systems . 
 the main difficulty here is that vortices are at finite density , which is familiar from dual approaches to the fractional quantum hall problem . as an initial step towards applying duality to frustrated spin systems , in ref . 
 we examined integer - spin triangular antiferromagnets with easy - plane symmetry from the vortex perspective . by _ fermionizing _ 
 the vortices using chern - simons flux attachment , it was shown that an effective low - energy dual formulation can be derived , which was argued to reproduce the physics of a more direct landau - ginzburg - wilson analysis of the spin model . while this approach is reminiscent of the spin fermionization adopted by yang _ 
 et al_.,@xcite we emphasize that alternatively fermionizing vortices is advantageous because the vortices interact logarithmically , which allows for a more controllable treatment of chern - simons gauge fluctuations . 
 here we extend the fermionized vortex approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with easy - plane symmetry and anisotropic nearest - neighbor exchanges @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in fig . 
 [ lattice ] . 
 this formalism allows us to explore the phase diagram of the spin model in a setting where a more conventional landau analysis of the spin model is _ not _ accessible due to berry phases . 
 remarkably , over a broad range of anisotropy @xmath7 this approach leads naturally , with the simplest flux - smeared mean - field starting point , to a novel `` critical '' spin liquid that we will refer to as the algebraic vortex liquid . 
 this state was introduced earlier and applied to  in a short letter , ref .  , and is characterized in detail here . 
 schematically , vortices form a critical state with four dirac nodes , and interact via a fluctuating gauge field representing the original boson current fluctuations . already on the mean - field level 
 , the gapless character of the vortex state implies power - law @xmath8 and @xmath9 spin correlations at specific wave vectors shown in figs . 
 [ bilinearqs ] and [ monopoleqs ] , respectively . 
 such momenta for low - energy excitations in the spin system are determined by short - distance physics in the frustrated magnet , and we propose that this physics is well - captured in the vortex treatment .    going beyond a mean - field analysis , we argue that the algebraic vortex liquid is described by qed3 with an emergent global su(4 ) flavor symmetry , which has further implications for the dynamical spin correlations . in particular , as a consequence of the su(4 ) symmetry 
 the in - plane spin structure factor exhibits enhanced universal power law correlations with the _ same exponent _ at several momenta in the brillouin zone : the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath10 and momenta @xmath11 at the midpoints of the brillouin zone edges ( see fig . 
 [ monopoleqs ] ) . 
 the out - of - plane spin structure factor meanwhile has enhanced correlations only at the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath12 . 
 these nontrivial properties distinguish the algebraic vortex liquid from other known spin liquids . 
 interestingly , the prominence of momenta @xmath13 in the theory appears to be consistent with recent series expansion studies of the heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet@xcite , which observe excitation energies at these wave vectors which are dramatically reduced relative to linear spin wave theory . 
 moreover , the prediction of `` active '' momenta @xmath10 and @xmath14 in the anisotropic system seems to capture the neutron scattering data for .@xcite    the phase diagram in the vicinity of the algebraic vortex liquid is also explored , and found to be rather rich . 
 nearby phases include the kalmeyer - laughlin chiral spin liquid , numerous magnetically ordered states including the coplanar spiral state , and variants of supersolids discussed recently.@xcite    in the range of anisotropy @xmath15 , our treatment captures the `` square - lattice '' neel ordered state , which is the expected ground state in this regime@xcite . here , we demonstrate in a particularly clear setting that anomalous `` roton '' minima in the excitation spectrum observed by series expansion studies can indeed be accounted for as low energy vortex - antivortex excitations.@xcite we further predict that these low - energy rotons may have still more dramatic effects in the easy - plane regime , which would be useful to explore using series expansions . 
 the paper is organized as follows . the spin model and the dual vortex mapping 
 are introduced in sec . 
 ii . in sec .  iii the fermionized vortex theory is developed . 
 we first discuss the `` roton '' excitations in the neel phase arising when @xmath15 . 
 we then obtain a low - energy effective theory for @xmath7 which contains a description of the algebraic vortex liquid . 
 iv focuses on the properties of the algebraic vortex liquid , including its stability , symmetries , and dynamic spin correlations . 
 the proximate phases of the algebraic vortex liquid are explored in sec . 
 v , and we conclude with a discussion in sec .  vi . 
 we begin by considering an easy - plane , anisotropic spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet modeled by an xxz hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor exchange , @xmath16 +      \sum_{\langle{\bf r r'}\rangle}j^z_{\bf r r ' } s^z_{\bf r } s^z_{\bf r ' } ,     \label{h}\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the usual spin raising and lowering operators . as illustrated in fig . 
 [ lattice ] , we take the in - plane exchange energy to be @xmath18 along bold horizontal links and @xmath19 along diagonal links of the triangular lattice . the out - of - plane exchange is defined to be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 to satisfy the easy - plane condition .    it is convenient to work with the easy - plane spin model recast in terms of quantum rotors by introducing an integer - valued boson number @xmath22 and its conjugate phase @xmath23 . upon identifying @xmath24 and @xmath25 , 
 the hamiltonian reads @xmath26 the @xmath27 term above energetically enforces the constraint of having either 0 or 1 boson per site as required for modeling a spin-1/2 system . 
 the xxz hamiltonian @xmath28 respects a number of internal and discrete lattice symmetries which we now enumerate . 
 the model exhibits u(1 ) spin symmetry and is invariant under time reversal @xmath29 and a `` particle - hole '' transformation @xmath30 which sends @xmath31 . under these operations , 
 the rotor fields transform as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant and @xmath29 is an antiunitary operation which sends @xmath34 . 
 the model also preserves translations @xmath35 by triangular lattice vectors @xmath36 , as well as @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 and inversions ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 rotations ) @xmath40 about a triangular lattice site . rather than considering the @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 , it will be useful for subsequent developments to work with a modified antiunitary reflection @xmath41 . 
 the latter operations transform the rotor fields as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an appropriately reflected coordinate . in the isotropic limit @xmath44 , 
 the xxz hamiltonian additionally preserves @xmath45 rotations @xmath46 about a triangular lattice site ; @xmath47 is then no longer an independent symmetry since @xmath48 .    in this paper 
 we are interested in exploring the phase diagram accessible with the above xxz spin model as a starting point . in particular , as the low spin and geometric frustration strongly suppress the tendency to magnetically order , it is natural to ask whether spin - liquid phases can be realized with not too drastic perturbations to the model . 
 to this end , we would like to derive an effective theory that governs the low - energy behavior of the spin system . 
 this is , for instance , readily achieved for the integer - spin analogue of eq . 
 ( [ h ] ) , and the phase diagram can be explored within a standard landau analysis . however , for the spin-1/2 system studied here a similar direct analysis of the spin model is hindered by the presence of berry phases . 
 consequently , obtaining a low - energy theory is largely intractable in this formulation .    to proceed we utilize an alternative dual approach , introduced in the context of integer - spin systems in ref .   , wherein one considers a reformulation of the problem in terms of _ 
 fermionized vortices_. in this framework , the basic degrees of freedom one works with are vortices  topological defects in which the phases @xmath23 of the spins wind by @xmath49 around a triangular plaquette as in fig . 
 [ lattice]rather than the spins themselves . 
 although the vortices as defined are bosonic , it will prove extremely useful to fermionize them in a manner familiar from the fractional quantum hall effect via chern - simons flux attachment . 
 doing so enables us to obtain a low - energy dual theory , which as we will demonstrate leads naturally to a novel `` critical '' spin - liquid phase , the algebraic vortex liquid . 
 we proceed now to the dual vortex theory . 
 we forgo the details of the duality mapping as these are provided in sec . 
 iii of ref .   in a very similar setting , and instead emphasize the important physical aspects of the dual theory . implementing the duality transformation on the quantum rotor hamiltonian eq . 
 ( [ hrotor]),@xcite one obtains a theory of bosonic vortices with `` electromagnetic '' interactions hopping among sites of the dual honeycomb lattice depicted by the dashed lines in fig . 
 [ lattice ] . 
 the vortices interact via a `` vector potential '' @xmath50 and a conjugate `` electric field '' @xmath51 which reside on honeycomb links and mediate a logarithmic vortex repulsion . here 
 @xmath52 denote nearest - neighbor honeycomb sites . 
 ( throughout , we distinguish sites of the honeycomb and triangular lattices by the labels `` @xmath53 '' and `` @xmath54 , '' respectively . ) 
 these dual gauge fields satisfy the commutation relation @xmath55 = i$ ] and commute on different links . in - plane spin components are encoded in this formulation through the `` electric field '' and the vortices . 
 the @xmath8 component of spin meanwhile appears as a dual `` magnetic flux , '' @xmath56 where @xmath57 signifies a lattice curl of @xmath58 around the hexagon encircling site @xmath54 of the triangular lattice . 
 although @xmath58 roams over the real numbers , the desired half - integer values of @xmath8 in eq . 
 ( [ sz ] ) are imposed energetically in the dual theory .    in terms of a vortex number operator @xmath59 and vortex creation operator @xmath60 
 , the dual vortex hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath61 together with a gauss s law constraint for the `` electric field '' , @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a static gauge field satisfying @xmath64 , and @xmath65 denotes a lattice divergence of @xmath51 at site @xmath53 . 
 moreover , @xmath66 describes the gauge field dynamics , @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 on the bold zigzag honeycomb links in fig .   [ lattice ] while @xmath71 on vertical honeycomb links .    the cosine term in eq . 
 ( [ hdual ] ) describes nearest - neighbor vortex hopping in an average background of @xmath39 flux per hexagon . 
 this background `` magnetic flux '' is provided by the static gauge field @xmath63 and arises because @xmath8 is half - integer valued in the original spin model . 
 ( the average background flux for an integer spin system , in contrast , is trivial.@xcite ) the hopping amplitudes @xmath72 are chosen to be anisotropic to reflect the spin exchange anisotropy . 
 in particular , as illustrated in fig . 
 [ lattice ] we take @xmath73 on the bold zigzag links of the honeycomb and @xmath74 on vertical links , with @xmath75 since vortices hop more easily across weak spin links than strong spin links 
 .    an important feature of the dual theory is that with our conventions@xcite the bosonic vortices are at _ half - filling _ , which is a direct consequence of the underlying frustration in the spin model . 
 for example , in the classical @xmath0 spin - ordered state we define the vortex number to be one on `` up '' triangles and zero on `` down '' triangles ( or vice versa , depending on the chirality ) . 
 the half - filling of the vortices becomes manifest upon reexpressing the dual hamiltonian in terms of an _ unconstrained _ electric field as follows , @xmath76 where @xmath77 encodes the logarithmic vortex repulsion . 
 equation ( [ hdual2 ] ) clearly exhibits a vortex particle - hole symmetry . 
 the transformation properties of the dual fields under the discrete microscopic symmetries can be straightforwardly deduced as discussed in ref .   . 
 these are summarized in table [ tab : dual ] . 
 the continuous u(1 ) spin symmetry , which reflects conservation of @xmath8 , is not directly manifest in this formulation and is instead replaced by a conservation of dual gauge flux , @xmath78 . 
 additionally , the dual hamiltonian has a u(1 ) gauge redundancy , being invariant under @xmath79 and @xmath80 for arbitrary @xmath81 .

98,"a total colouring of a simple graph is a simultaneous assignment of labels to its vertices and edges such that adjacent vertices get distinct colours , adjacent edges get distinct colours and the colour of each edge is distinct from the colours of its endpoint vertices ( or equivalently the colour of each vertex is distinct from the colours of its incident edges ) . 
 it is thus a combination of a proper vertex colouring , a proper edge colouring and a further restriction on the interplay between these colourings . 
 the notion of total colouring was introduced by behzad [ 2 ] and vizing [ 8 ] and those papers also conjectured that @xmath1 . 
 it is immediate that @xmath2 , since a vertex of maximum degree and its incident edges must all get distinct colours . 
 a lot of work has been done on total colouring , based on frugal colouring , the list colouring conjecture etc .    in this work 
 our aim is not to make headway in the total colouring problem but rather to get a complete characterisation of the class of total graphs of simple graphs . towards this end , we of course need a precise definition of what we mean by the total graph of a given graph , which is an existing concept . 
 this also brings along the concept of line graphs . 
 the vertex set of the total graph of a simple graph can be partitioned into two sets , one corresponding to the vertex set of the original graph ( inverse total graph ) and the other the line graph of the original graph , with crossing edges between these two vertex sets . 
 a result characterising total graphs was obtained by behzad [ 1 ] in 1970 , and earlier works obtained interesting properties on this class of graphs [ 4 ] . 
 the fact that any total graph has a unique preimage under the inverse total graph operator was proved by [ 3 ] . 
 we obtain a new characterisation of total graphs based on the induced subgraphs on the neighbourhood of maximum degree vertices . 
 these characterisations allow us to distinguish vertex vertices from edge vertices among the vertices of maximum degree . using this characterisation 
 , we develop an efficient algorithm which iteratively creates the partition of the vertex set of the candidate total graph into its inverse total graph and line graph . 
 the paper is organised as follows . 
 definitions and notation used in the paper are presented in section  [ secdefnnot ] . 
 basic properties and theorems on total graphs are presented in section  [ sectotgraintro ] . 
 section  [ sectotalcomplete ] presents our results for special classes , the most elegant among which is the explicit construction for complete graphs . in section  [ sectotgrachar ] 
 we present our theorems characterising the two classes of vertices and develop our theorem into an algorithm for reconstructing the inverse total graph of a given total graph . 
 we summarise our work and indicate possible future directions for research in section  [ secconcl ] . 
 in this section we present the basic definitions and notation we use throughout the paper . 
 all graphs we consider are finite , simple , undirected and connected . 
 this problem for graphs with more than one component are strsaightforward extensions of the connected case . 
 [ deflngr ] the * line graph * @xmath3 of a graph @xmath4 is defined as the graph with vertex set having one vertex corresponding to each edge in @xmath5 and an edge between two vertices of @xmath3 precisely when the edges of @xmath5 that those vertices correspond to , have a common endpoint . 
 not all graphs are line graphs of a simple graph ( or for that matter even of a multigraph ) . 
 the line graph of a graph is however well defined , and results in a unique graph . 
 the concept of line graph can thus be viewed as a non - surjective function from the set of simple graphs to the set of simple graphs . when we limit attention to connected simple graphs , it is further known that this function is almost injective . 
 there is only one pair of distinct graphs with the same line graph namely the three vertex cycle @xmath6 and the three leaf star @xmath7 both of whose line graphs are @xmath6 . 
 thus it is an interesting question both combinatorially and algorithmically as to which graphs are line graphs of some simple graph , and computing the inverse - line graph ( the preimage under the line graph function ) for those graphs which are line graphs [ 6 ] iterating the line graph operator and its inverse , as well as properties of the resulting sequence of graphs has also been studied extensively in the literature [ 5][7 ]    an obvious application of the concept of line graphs is to translate edge colouring problems into equivalent vertex colouring problems on the line graph . 
 similarly , we define the total graph of a graph . again 
 , this transformation renders a total colouring problem on a graph into a vertex colouring problem on an equivalent graph . 
 the total graph concept can also be viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs . 
 it has been established that the total graph viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs is injective . 
 [ deftotgr ] the total graph @xmath8 of a graph @xmath4 has as vertex set one vertex for each edge and vertex in @xmath5 . 
 two vertices in @xmath8 are adjacent precisely when the elements ( vertex or edge ) of @xmath5 they represent are adjacent / incident to each other in @xmath5 . 
 [ defnvertcatg ] thus the vertex set of the total graph of a graph can be partitioned into :    1 . 
 the vertices of the original graph @xmath9we call such a vertex a * vertex vertex*@xmath10 2 . 
 the vertices of the line graph @xmath9we call such a vertex an * edge vertex*@xmath10 . 
 [ defmixclq ] a * mixed clique * in a total graph is a clique which has at least one vertex from the set of vertex vertices and at least one vertex from the set of edge vertices in a valid partition of the total graph into the inverse total graph and its line graph . 
 [ defnpureclq]a * pure clique * in a total graph is a clique consisting exclusively of vertex vertices or exclusively of edge vertices . 
 the vertex set of a total graph @xmath11 has a partition into two disjoint sets , such that the induced subgraph on one part is the inverse total graph @xmath5 and the other is the line graph @xmath3 . in several total graphs , 
 this partitioning is non - unique , but the different partitions are all isomporphic to each other . 
 these are called the vertex part and the edge part respectively . the bipartite subgraph induced by 
 the division as above is 2-regular on vertices in the edge part . 
 this is because each edge in the inverse total graph has precisely two endpoints . 
 thus an algorithm for computing the inverse total graph of a given graph ( if it is a total graph ) is based on finding such a division or partition of the vertex set . 
 [ thmmixedclq ] the largest mixed clique consisting of at least two vertex vertices is in a total graph is of size 3 . 
 consider a clique consisting of three vertex vertices . clearly there is no edge in any graph incident to three distinct vertices . 
 hence this clique can not be augmented to include any edge vertices , and thus is not the subset of any mixed clique . 
 it follows that a mixed clique can consist of at most two adjacent vertex vertices . in this case 
 this can be augmented by only one vertex , the edge vertex representing the link between these two adjacent vertex vertices . 
 @xmath12    thus a maximal mixed clique is either :    * a vertex vertex and all its adjacent edge vertices ; or * two adjacent vertex vertices and the connecting edge vertex .    in summary , 
 a maximal mixed clique is either of size 3 or of size @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the degree of its only vertex vertex in the total graph .      in this subsection 
 , we derive results expressing the degree sequence of a total graph in terms of the degree sequence of its inverse total graph . 
 [ thmdegvertvert ] the degree of a vertex vertex in a total graph is 2 times the degree of the original vertex in the inverse total graph .    in the total graph 
 a vertex vertex is adjacent to vertices corresponding to its original neighbours as well as its incident edges in the original graph . 
 see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . 
 @xmath12    [ thmdegedgevert ] the degree of an edge vertex in a total graph is equal to the sum of the degrees of the endpoint vertices of the original edge in the inverse total graph .    in the total graph 
 an edge vertex is adjacent to its two endpoints ( which are both vertex vertices ) , and the other edges incident to these endpoints ( which are all edge vertices ) . 
 thus if its endpoints are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , its degree is @xmath17 . 
 see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . 
 @xmath12    [ thmdegtotreg ] the total graph of a graph is regular if and only if the original graph is regular . 
 this is an immediate consequence of theorems  [ thmdegvertvert ] and [ thmdegedgevert ] . 
 @xmath12    [ cliqueververedge ] consider a maximal mixed clique of size 3 in a total graph . 
 let the two vertex vertices be of degrees @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . 
 then the degree of the edge vertex of this clique is @xmath21 . 
 clearly @xmath22 . 
 this follows from definition  [ defmixclq ] and theorem  [ thmmixedclq ]    @xmath12    given a vertex vertex @xmath23 of degree @xmath14 in a total graph , its neighbours can be divided into @xmath24 pairs representing :    * its distinct incident edges @xmath25 in the inverse total graph and * the other endpoints of those edges @xmath26 respectively . 
 the @xmath24 pairs are @xmath27 . 
 see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . 
 the degrees of each pair is related to the degree of the selected vertex vertex according to theorem  [ cliqueververedge ]    @xmath12      here we extend the work of the previous subsection in a natural way obtaining results expressing the number of vertices and edges of a total graph in terms of the corresponding parameters of the inverse total graph . 
 [ relation ] let @xmath28 for the given @xmath4 . 
 1 .   @xmath29 2 . 
 @xmath30    * the total graph of a given graph contains the original graph and the line graph of the original graph as disjoint induced subgraphs spanning all its vertices . 
 the line graph of the original graph g has @xmath31 vertices . 
 therefore , @xmath29 * the edge set of the total graph can be partitioned into @xmath32 disjoint sets : 1 .   * a : * edge set of the original graph containg @xmath31 edges . 
 * b : * edges which are present between the original graph and its line graph . 
 there are @xmath33 such edges . 
 + note : the line graph of the given @xmath5 has @xmath31 vertices and each vertex of the line graph is connected to exactly @xmath34 vertices of the original graph . 
 * c * : edges which are present within the line graph . 
 the number of such edges is @xmath35 * explanation for edges present within the line graph : + the number of edges in the subgraph induced by any subset @xmath36 of vertices of a graph @xmath5 is given by @xmath37 applying this rule , gives us the claimed result for portion * c*. + now the maximum possible degree for any vertex of the given simple connected graph is @xmath38 . 
 + thus , + @xmath39 * now the total number of edges in @xmath40 + @xmath41    @xmath12    for instance @xmath42 has 9 vertices and 23 edges . 
 these numbers conform to the constraints derived by us above . 
 we give explicit constructions for the total graphs of paths , cycles and complete graphs in this section . 
 the first result is for cycles . 
 [ thmcycles ] a graph is the total graph of the cycle @xmath43 on @xmath44 vertices if and only if :    * it has @xmath45 vertices @xmath46 * contains two vertex disjoint cycles of length @xmath44 each , labeled @xmath47 * contains a hamiltonian cycle edge disjoint with the afore mentioned cycles with the order of vertices being @xmath48 . 
 this result is self explanatory . 
 see  figure [ hamiltonian ] . 
 @xmath12    [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ]     [ edgevertchar ] given an arbitrary maximum degree vertex @xmath16 , of degree @xmath14 , in a total graph @xmath11 , ( @xmath49 ) it is an edge vertex , if and only if in the subgraph induced on its open neighbourhood : + its neighbours can be partitioned into 2 maximal cliques of exactly @xmath24 vertices each consisting of one vertex vertex and @xmath50 edge vertices . 
 the statement follows from an inspection of figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . 
 @xmath12    in 4-regular candadate total graphs ( total graphs of cycles ) , each vertex satisfies the conditions of both the above theorems . 
 that is because the two parts of any valid partition are isomorphic to each other . 
 given any input ( candidate ) total graph @xmath11 , where @xmath49 , it is indeed a total graph if and only if the graph @xmath51 is a total graph where @xmath52 is obtained from @xmath5 by eliminating a vertex vertex of maximum degree along with all its edge neighbours in @xmath53 .    if the given graph is indeed a total graph , then it has a partition of its vertex set into vertex vertices and edge vertices . 
 the algorithmic version of theorem  [ vertvertchar ] allows us to find a vertex vertex of maximum degree as well as identify its edge neighbours . deleting the vertex along with its edge neighbours , 
 effectively eliminates the vertex and the incident edges from the inverse total graph . 
 we are left with the total graph of the graph with one vertex deleted . 
 recursing on the smaller graph , we obtain the partition or conclude that none exists if at some iteration a maximum degree vertex violates both theorems  [ vertvertchar ] ,  [ edgevertchar ] . 
 @xmath12    we thus have an algorithm which starts with a candidate total graph of a non - complete graph and decides whether it is indeed a total graph by recursing on the smaller graph or recourse to complete graph theorem . + 
 * *    1 . 
 check if the given graph is the total graph of a complete graph using algorithm  1 . 
 if so augument the vertices of that complete subgraph to the vertices obtained in earlier iterations and return . 
 scan the vertices of maximum degree one by one , for conformity to theorem  [ vertvertchar ] until one , say @xmath54 is found . 
 if during this process we find a vertex of maximum degree violating both theorems  [ vertvertchar ] ,  [ edgevertchar ] then stop and conclude that it is not the total graph of any graph . 
 3 .   for the vertex @xmath54 , from step 2 , partition its neighbours into vertex vertices and edge vertices by the algorithmic version of theorem  [ vertvertchar ] . 
 4 .   add @xmath54 to the vertex set of the inverse total graph and repeat the steps with the graph obtained by deleting @xmath54 and its edge neighbours . 
 return the set of vertices ( and the induced subgraph on them ) accumulated in step 4 over all the iterations . 
 we have proved properties of the vertex degrees of total graphs . 
 we have developed a precise characterisation of the structure of the neighbourhoods of maximum degree vertices of the total graph of any graph . combining these results 
 we have designed an efficient iterative algorithm to compute the inverse total graph of a candidate total graph , or report that the graph is not a total graph . 
 we also present a direct construction for the total graphs of paths , cycles and complete graphs .    one interesting direction of future research is to see if a given @xmath44 and @xmath55 pair admits a connected unique total graph if any . 
 one can also look at minimum number of dynamic graph operations ( adding / deleting vertices and edges or moving edges around the graph ) to transform a non - total graph into a total graph .

 on the side of @xmath0body simulations recent years brought a significant progress in both hardware and software . 
 first , parallel ( even massively parallel ) computing has opened a route to gain performance at relatively low cost and little technological advancement . 
 secondly , the already successful grape special purpose computers ( sugimoto et al . 1990 , makino et al . 1997 , makino & taiji 1998 , makino 2002 , makino & hut 2003 ) have been developed in their present generation ( grape6 ) and aim at the 100 tflops speed . 
 nbody6++ ( spurzem 1999 ) , the successor of aarseth s nbody6 code has been ported on massively parallel , general purpose computers ( cray t3e and pc clusters ) and was used for astrophysical problems related to the dissolution of globular clusters ( baumgardt 2001 , baumgardt , hut & heggie . 
 2002 ) and the decay of massive black hole binaries in galactic nuclei after a merger ( milosavljevic & merritt 2001 , hemsendorf , sigurdsson & spurzem 2002 ) . despite such progresses in hardware and software 
 there is still impossible to model directly evolution of real globular cluster ( @xmath3 ) and galactic nuclei ( @xmath4 ) . 
 recent work by baumgardt ( 2002 ) and baumgardt & makino ( 2002 ) has pushed the limits of present direct modeling to about @xmath5 using both nbody6++ and the grape6 special purpose hardware .    on the side of fokker 
 planck method with finite differences and an anisotropic gaseous model , recent years brought great improvements . 
 models can be used now to simulate more realistic stellar systems . 
 they can tackle : anisotropy , rotation , a tidal boundary , tidal shocking by galactic disk and bulge , mass spectrum , stellar evolution and dynamical and primordial binaries ( louis & spurzem 1991 , giersz & spurzem 1994 , takahashi 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , spurzem 1996 , takahashi & portegies zwart 1998 , 2000 hereafter tpz , drukier 1999 , einsel & spurzem 1999 , takahashi & lee 2000 , kim et al . 
 2002 , kim , lee & spurzem 2004 , fiestas , spurzem & kim 2005 ) . 
 unfortunately , the fokker 
 planck approach suffers , among other things , from the uncertainty of differential cross  sections of many processes which are important during cluster evolution . 
 it can not supply detailed information about the formation and movement of all objects present in clusters . 
 additionally , the anisotropic gaseous model assumes a certain form of heat conductivity and closure relations between the third order moments . 
 there is an elegant alternative to generate models of star clusters , which can correctly reproduce the stochastic features of real star clusters , but without really integrating all orbits directly as in an @xmath0body simulation . 
 they rely on the fokker 
 planck approximation and ( hitherto ) spherical symmetry , but their data structure is very similar to an @xmath0body model . 
 these so  called monte carlo models were first presented by hnon ( 1971 , 1975 ) , spitzer ( 1975 ) and later improved by stodkiewicz ( 1982 , 1985 , 1986 ) and in further work by giersz ( 1997 , 1998 , 2001 ) , and recently by rasio and his collaborators ( joshi , rasio & portegies zwart 2000 , watters , joshi & rasio 2000 , joshi , nave & rasio 2001 , fregeau et al . 
 2003 , grkan , freitag & rasio 2004 ) , and freitag ( freitag 2000 , freitag & benz 2001 , 2002 ) . 
 the basic idea is to have pseudo  particles , which orbital parameters are given in a smooth , self  consistent potential . 
 however , their orbital motion is not explicitly followed ; to model interactions with other particles like two  body relaxation by distant encounters or strong interactions between binaries and other objects , a position of the particle in its orbit , and further free parameters of the individual encounter , are picked from an appropriate distribution by using random numbers . 
 the monte carlo scheme takes full advantage of the established physical knowledge about the secular evolution of ( spherical ) star clusters as inferred from continuum model simulations . 
 additionally , it describes in a proper way the graininess of the gravitational field and the stochasticity of real @xmath0body systems and provides , in a manner as detailed as in direct @xmath0body simulations , information about the movement of any objects in the system . 
 this does not include any additional physical approximations or assumptions which are common in fokker  planck and gas models ( e.g. for conductivity ) . because of this , the monte carlo scheme can be regarded as a method which lies between direct @xmath0body and fokker 
 planck models and combines most of their advantages . 
 a hybrid variant of the monte carlo technique combined with a gaseous model has been proposed by spurzem & giersz ( 1996 ) , and applied to systems with a large number of primordial binaries by giersz & spurzem ( 2000 ) and giersz & spurzem ( 2003 ) and for tidally limited systems by spurzem ( 2005 ) . 
 the hybrid method uses a monte carlo model for binaries or any other object for which a statistical description , as used by the gaseous model , is not appropriate due to small numbers of objects or unknown analytic cross sections for interaction processes . 
 the method is particularly useful for investigating the evolution of large stellar systems with a realistic fraction of primordial binaries , but could also be used in the future to include , for example , the build up of massive stars and blue stragglers by stellar collisions . 
 very detailed observations of globular clusters which are available at present or will become available in future ( e.g. the hubble space telescope and the new very large terrestrial telescopes ) have extended and will extend our knowledge about their stellar content , internal dynamics and the influence of the environment on cluster evolution ( janes 1991 , djorgovski & meylan 1993 , smith & brodie 1993 , hut & makino 1996 , meylan & heggie 1997 ) . 
 this data covers luminosity functions and derived mass functions , color  magnitude diagrams , population and kinematical analysis , including binaries and compact stellar evolution remnants , detailed two  dimensional proper motion and radial velocity data , and tidal tails spanning over arcs several degrees wide ( koch et al . 2004 ) . 
 a wealth of information on `` peculiar '' objects in globular clusters ( blue stragglers , x  ray sources ( high and low  luminosity ) , millisecond pulsars , etc . ) suggests a very close interplay between stellar evolution , binary evolution and dynamical interactions . 
 this interplay is far from being understood . 
 moreover , recent observations suggest that the primordial binary fraction in a globular cluster can be as high as @xmath6 
 @xmath7 ( rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ) , and possible existence of intermediate 
 mass black holes in the centers of some globular clusters ( gebhardt 2000 ) . with all these observational data such as king at al .

 ( 2001 ) , hansen et al . 
 ( 2002 ) , richer et al . 
 ( 2002 ) ( to mention only a few papers ) , easily reproducible reliable modelling becomes more important than before . 
 monte carlo codes provide all the necessary flexibility to disentangle the mutual interactions between all physical processes which are important during globular cluster evolution and to perform in a reasonable time , detailed simulations of real globular clusters . 
 the ultimate aim of the project described here is to build a monte carlo code ( in the framework of the modest international collaborations , * http:/www.manybody.org / modest * ) , which will be able to simulate the evolution of real globular clusters , as closely as possible . in this paper ( the third in the series ) 
 the monte carlo code ( which was discussed in detail in papers i and ii ) is used to simulate the evolution of stellar systems , which consist of comparable number of stars and have mass comparable to real globular clusters . 
 the results of simulations will be compared with those of chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 , hereafter cw ) , vesperini & heggie ( 1997 , hereafter vh ) , aarseth & heggie ( 1998 , hereafter ah ) , baumgardt & makino ( 2002 ) and lamers ( 2005 ) . 
 the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 
 , a short description of processes implemented into the monte carlo code will be presented . in section 3 
 , the initial conditions will be discussed and results of the simulation will be shown . and finally , in section 4 the conclusions will be presented . 
 the monte carlo method can be regarded as a statistical way of solving the fokker 
 planck equation . 
 its implementation presented in giersz ( 1998 , hereafter paper i ) and giersz ( 2001 , hereafter paper ii ) is based on the orbit  averaged monte carlo method developed in the early seventies by hnon ( 1971 ) and then substantially improved by stodkiewicz ( 1986 , and references therein ) , and recently by giersz ( paper i and ii ) , by freitag ( freitag & benz 2001 , 2002 ) and by rasio s group ( joshi 2000 , 2001 , fregeau 2003 , 2004 , fregeau , chatterjee & rasio 2005 , freitag , grkan & rasio 2005 , freitag , rasio & baumgardt 2005 ) . 
 the code is described in detail in paper i , which deals with simulations of isolated , single 
 mass systems and in paper ii in which additional physical processes were included : multi  mass systems and stellar evolution , mass loss through the tidal boundary , formation of three  body binaries and their subsequent interactions with field stars , and interactions between binaries .    for the sake of completeness 
 , a short description of the main ingredients of the monte carlo model will follow . for more detailed discussion of the code readers should refer to paper i and ii .      to facilitate comparison with results of other numerical simulations of globular cluster evolution ( e.g. cw , fukushige & heggie 1995 , giersz & heggie 1997 , vh , ah , tpz , jnr ) and for simplicity a single power 
 low approximation of imf was used . 
 @xmath8    where c and @xmath9 are constants . 
 the @xmath10 , minimum stellar mass and @xmath11 , maximum stellar mass were chosen to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . however , it should be noted that observations give more and more evidence that the mass function in globular / open clusters and for field stars as well is not a simple power 
 law , but it could be rather approximated by a composite power  law ( e.g. kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 , kroupa 2002 ) . to describe the mass loss due to stellar evolution the same simplified stellar evolution model as adopted by cw was used . 
 more sophisticated models of stellar and binary evolution based on fitting analytical formulae to the evolution tracks for stars and binaries were developed by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) , hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) , hurley , tout & pols ( 2003 ) and belczyski , kalogera & bulik ( 2002 ) . 
 these models , among others , were used in population synthesis codes ( e.g. belczyski & taam 2004 ) , and simulations of the evolution of real star cluster m67 ( e.g. hurley _ et al _ 2005 ) . 
 the initial masses of stars are generated from the continuous distribution given in equation ( 1 ) . 
 this ensure a natural spread in their lifetimes . to ensures that the cluster remains close to virial equilibrium during rapid mass loss due to stellar evolution , 
 special care is taken , that no more than @xmath14 of the total cluster mass is lost during one overall time  step .      for tidally limited star cluster 
 the rate of mass loss is much higher than for isolated systems . 
 this is connected with the tidal stripping of mass across the system boundary by the gravitational field of a parent galaxy . for isolated system mass loss 
 is attributed mainly to rare strong interactions in the dense , inner part of the system . in the present monte carlo code a mixed criterion is used to identify escapers : a combination of apocentre and energy  based criteria ( see paper ii ) . 
 this means that no potential escapers are kept in the system . 
 stars regarded as escapers are instantaneously lost from the system . 
 this is in contrast to @xmath0body simulations where stars need time proportional to the dynamical time to be removed from the system . 
 recently , baumgardt ( 2000 ) showed that stars with energy greater than the tidal cutoff energy @xmath15 , in the course of escape , can again become bound to the system , because of distant interactions with field stars . 
 a similar conclusion was reached by fukushige & heggie ( 2000 ) , who showed that the escape time 
 scale can be very long ( much larger than the half  mass relaxation time ) . additionally , during the final stages of cluster evolution or for clusters with initially low central concentration 
 , the mass loss across the tidal boundary can become unstable when too many stars are removed from the system at the same time . to properly follow these stages of evolution the time 
 step has to be decreased to force smaller mass loss .      in the present monte carlo code 
 ( as it was described in paper i ) all stellar objects , including binaries , are treated as single _ 
 superstars_. this allows to introduce into the code , in a simple and accurate way , processes of stochastic formation of binaries and their subsequent stochastic interactions with field stars and other binaries . 
 the procedure of binary formation in three 
 body interactions is in great detail described in paper ii . 
 it relies on the observation that the probability that the masses of the three stars involved in the interaction are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are number densities of three interacting stars and the total number density , respectively ) and the rate of binary formation is proportional to @xmath24 . 
 these considerations lead to the formula for the probability of binary formation which depends only on the local total number density instead of local number densities of each mass involved in the interaction ( see equation 7 in paper ii ) . 
 this procedure substantially reduces fluctuations in the binary formation rate . 
 the determination of the local number density in the monte carlo code , particularly for multi  mass systems , is a very delicate and difficult matter ( paper i ) .    the energy generation in binary 
 field star interactions is computed according to the ( appropriately modified for multi  mass case ) semi  empirical formula of spitzer ( spitzer 1987 ) . 
 unfortunately , for multi  component systems there is no simple semi  empirical formula which can fit all numerical data ( heggie , hut & mcmillan 1996 ) . 
 the total probability of the interaction between a binary of binding energy @xmath25 consisting of mass @xmath16 and @xmath17 and a field star of mass @xmath18 was deduced from equations ( 6 - 23 ) , ( 6 - 11 ) and ( 6 - 12 ) presented in spitzer ( 1987 ) and results of heggie ( 1975 ) with an appropriately adjusted coefficient ( the total probability computed is such a way gives correct value for the equal  mass case ) . 
 @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the mean stellar mass in a zone , and @xmath30 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion . 
 this procedure is , of course , oversimplified and in some situations can not give correct results , for example , when a field star is very light compared to the mass of the binary components . 
 the implementation of interactions between binaries in the code is based on the method described by stodkiewicz ( 1986 ) and then improved in paper ii . 
 only strong interactions are considered , and only two types of outcomes are permitted : heavier binary and two single stars , or two binaries in a hyperbolic relative orbit . 
 stable three 
 body configurations are not allowed . in the case 
 when binaries are only formed in dynamical processes , and only a few binaries are present , at any time , in the system , it is very difficult to use the binary density ( giersz & spurzem 2000 ) to calculate the probability of a binary  binary interaction . given 
 binary can hit only binaries ( regarded as targets ) whose actual distance from the cluster center lies between its pericenter and apocenter . 
 this leads to the following formula for the binary  binary interaction probability . 
 @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the relative velocity between interacting binaries , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radial velocity , radial position , orbital period of a binary in the system and impact parameter ( equal to @xmath37 times the semi 
 major axis of the softer binary ) , respectively . 
 the outcome of the interaction is as follows ( see details in stodkiewicz 1986 , paper ii and mikkola 1983 , 1984 ) :    * two binaries in a hyperbolic relative orbit ( @xmath38 of all interactions ) . 
 energy generation is equal to @xmath39 times the binding energy of the softer binary . 
 * one binary and two escapers ( @xmath40 of all interactions ) . 
 the softer binary is destroyed and the harder binary increases its binding energy by the amount equal to @xmath41 times the sum of binding energies of binaries . 
 the procedures described above are very uncertain in regard to the amount of energy generation . to cure this problem , 
 it is planned in the near future to introduce into the code numerical procedures ( based on aarseth s nbody6 code ) , which can numerically integrate the motion of three and four  body subsystems . 
 a similar procedure was introduced , with success , into the hybrid code ( giersz & spurzem 2000 , 2003 ) . 
 in paper ii a survey of the evolution of @xmath0body systems influenced by the tidal field of a parent galaxy , by stellar evolution and by energy generation in interactions between binaries and field stars and binaries themselves was discussed . here , the first monte carlo simulations of million body systems are presented . 
 the results will be discussed from the point of view of system parameters which can be verified by observational data . among others , 
 evolution of lmf and gmf , anisotropy , total mass , mean mass , mass segregation and density profiles will be presented . 
 the initial conditions were chosen in a similar way as in the `` collaborative experiment '' ( heggie 1999 ) and paper ii . 
 the positions and velocities of all stars were drawn from the king model ( king 1966 ) . 
 all models have the same total number of stars @xmath42 and the same tidal radius @xmath43 pc . 
 masses of stars are drawn from the power  law mass function according to equation ( 1 ) . 
 the minimum mass was chosen to be @xmath44 and the maximum mass @xmath45 . 
 two different values of the power 
 law index were chosen : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . 
 the sets of initial king models were characterized by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . 
 all models are listed in table 1 .

 @xmath58 is the circular speed of the cluster around the galaxy . in order to scale the monte carlo time to physical units 
 the following formula is used    @xmath59    where @xmath53 is the tidal radius in monte carlo units , @xmath60 is the total cluster mass and @xmath61 is the tidal radius , both are in solar mass and pc , respectively and @xmath62 is equal to @xmath63 as for single  mass systems ( giersz & heggie 1994 ) . however , for multi  mass systems it could be much smaller ( giersz & heggie 1996 , 1997 ) . 
 the initial model is not in virial equilibrium , because of statistical noise and because of masses , which are assigned independently from the positions and velocities . 
 therefore , the model has to be initially rescaled to fulfill the virial equilibrium condition . during all the simulations 
 the virial ratio is kept within @xmath64 of the equilibrium value ( for the worst case within @xmath65 ) . 
 standard @xmath0body units ( heggie & mathieu 1986 ) , in which the total mass @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the initial total energy of the cluster is equal to @xmath68 , have been adopted for all runs . 
 monte carlo time is equal to @xmath0body time divided by @xmath69 . in the course of evolution , when the cluster looses mass , the tidal radius changes according to @xmath70 .    finally , a few words about the efficiency of the monte carlo code presented here . 
 the simulation of a million body systems took about two / three weeks ( depending on an initial model ) on a pentium 4 , 2 ghz pc . 
 this is still much faster than the biggest direct @xmath0body simulations performed on grape4 ( teraflop special  purpose hardware ) . nevertheless , the speed of the code is not high enough to perform large scale survey simulations in a reasonable time . 
 it is clear , that to simulate the evolution of real globular clusters with all physical processes in operation , a substantial speed  up of the code is needed . 
 this can be done , either by parallelizing the code ( in a similar way to jnr ) , introducing a more efficient way of determining the new positions of _ superstars _ , introducing _ 
 superstars _ which contain a different number of stars , or by using a hybrid code ( as was done by giersz & spurzem 2000 , 2003 ) . however , the monte carlo code has presently a great relative advantage over the @xmath0body code for simulations with a large number of primordial binaries . 
 primordial binaries substantially downgrade the performance of @xmath0body codes on supercomputers or on special  purpose hardware . 
 they can be introduced into the monte carlo code in a natural way , practically without a substantial loss of performance ( giersz & spurzem 2000 , 2003 ) .      the rate of cluster evolution and indirectly the strength of the tidal field is described by the parameter @xmath55 ( equation . 
 4 ) . generally 
 , the greater the value of @xmath55 , the longer the relaxation time and the slower the cluster evolution . 
 the same relation is true also for the distance of a globular cluster to the galactic center , @xmath52 ( keeping the constant total cluster mass @xmath51 and number of stars @xmath71 ) 
 . the greater the @xmath55 , the larger the @xmath52 . as one can see from the table 1 distance @xmath52 is rather small this means that the galactic tidal field is very strong and globular cluster evolution is very fast . 
 these initial conditions were chosen mainly to speed up the simulations and discussed models similar to models considered by vh . 
 figure 1 presents the evolution of the total mass for all discussed models . 
 three phases of evolution are clearly visible . the first phase is connected with the violent mass loss due to stellar evolution of the most massive stars . 
 then , there is the long phase connected with gradual mass loss due to tidal stripping . and finally , there is the phase connected with the tidal disruption of a cluster . 
 the last phase is well visible only in model w7235 , which evolution is followed long enough . in model w3235 on can see a phase when the total cluster mass is nearly constant and very small ( about a few thousands of the initial mass ) . 
 this is an artificial effect connected with the fact that the monte carlo code can not properly deal with systems with the total binding energy close to zero and consist of only a few dozen particles . 
 it is interesting to note , that the second phase ( gradual tidal stripping ) can be divided into two subphases , clearly separated by the core collapse time . for the post collapse phase 
 the rate of mass loss is slightly steeper than in the collapse phase . 
 this can be connected with the fact that hard interactions , which involve binaries , start to operate introducing an additional mechanism of the mass loss ( escaping stars and binaries ) . 
 models with the same mass  function ( @xmath72 ) and with different @xmath73 show very similar evolution during the phase of tidal stripping ( except w3235 ) . 
 it seems that the initial mass loss due to stellar evolution is not sufficiently strong to substantially change the initial cluster structure . 
 model w3235 is not initially concentrated strongly enough to survive without substantial structure changes , the violent mass loss event . 
 figure 1 presents qualitatively very similar features as figures shown by vh , paper ii , baumgardt & makino ( 2002 ) and lamers ( 2005 ) , figure 1 , figures 1 - 3 , figure 1 and figure 2 , respectively . 
 the total mass loss consists of mass loss due to stellar evolution ( @xmath74 ) and mass loss connected with tidal stripping ( @xmath75 ) . 
 results presented in figure 2 are in a good qualitative agreement with the @xmath0-body results of vh ( figure 2 ) , taking into account that @xmath9 adopted by vh is @xmath76 instead @xmath77 . according to equation 11 of vh , 
 the evolution of the total mass of the cluster can be fitted by a simple analytical expression , which consists of two terms : @xmath74 and @xmath75 . 
 the amount of mass loss because of @xmath75 can be fitted ( as it was shown in vh ) by a straight line with a coefficient @xmath78 . 
 the values of @xmath78 listed by vh are 0.828 and 0.790 for models 
 @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively . the equivalent values for the monte carlo models are 0.999 and 0.943 . the bigger values of @xmath78 for the monte carlo models can be attributed mainly to the different : escape criterion , power  low index of the initial mass function and slight increase of the rate of mass loss due to binary activities ( see figure 1 ) . as it was stated in section 2.2 
 , the escape criterion adopted in this paper ( together with the instantaneous removal of escapers ) leads to a higher escape rate than in @xmath0body simulations . 
 additionally , less steep initial mass function causes stronger mass loss due to stellar evolution and consequently leads to more escapers than the steeper mass function adopted by vh . 
 mass loss connected with stellar evolution dominates the initial phase of cluster evolution 
 . then the rate of stellar evolution substantially slows down and escape due to tidal stripping takes over . during this phase of evolution 
 the rate of mass loss due to stellar evolution is nearly constant , and higher for shallower mass functions ( as expected ) . 
 energy carried away by stellar evolution events dominates the energy loss due to tidal stripping , even though the tidal mass loss is higher . 
 it is worth to note , that all models except w3235 show clear gravothermal oscillations in the post collapse phase . 
 the oscillations become less and less visible when the cluster is approaching the final stages of dissolution .    generally , agreement throughout the evolution between the results presented here and those by ah , vh , baumgardt & makino ( 2002 ) and lamers ( 2005 ) for @xmath0body models , tpz for 2d fokker  planck models and by jnr and paper ii for monte carlo models is rather good . in all cases , 
 the qualitative behaviour is very similar . 
 nevertheless , the treatment of escapers for a tidally limited system proposed by spurzem ( 2005 ) can be implemented to properly ando more accurately follow the mass loss due to tidal stripping and the final stages of the cluster evolution , just before the dissolution .    at the end of this section the evolution of the density profiles for model 
 w7235 will be discussed ( see figure 3 ) . 
 the very large number of particles in models allows substantial reduction in statistical fluctuations and computation ( with high precision ) of the density profiles in the course of cluster evolution . from the theoretical considerations it follows that , during the collapse phase the nearly isothermal core is building up . at the time of core bounce ( about 3.5 gyr ) the density profile reaches the theoretically predicted power  low index equal to @xmath81 . 
 then this index is preserved during the further post  collapse evolution . for models 
 w7235 , w5235 and w335 the evolution of density profiles is practically the same . only for model w3235 , which undergoes strong mass loss due to stellar evolution and tidal stripping the density profiles do not show any signs of power  low core development . the initial shape of the profile is practically preserved ( taking into account the reduction of central density and tidal radius ) .      the degree of velocity anisotropy is measured by a quantity    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the radial and tangential one  dimensional velocity dispersions , respectively . for isotropic systems 
 @xmath85 is equal to zero . 
 systems preferentially populated by radial orbits have @xmath85 positive and systems preferentially populated by tangential orbits have @xmath85 negative . 
 the evolution of anisotropy is presented in figures 4 to 6 for models w3235 , w5235 and w7235 , respectively . as can be seen in figure 4 , for systems which can not survive the violent initial mass loss without strong structural changes ( see discussion in the previous section ) , 
 anisotropy stays close to zero with very large fluctuations . 
 the system does not live long enough and the tidal stripping is strong enough to prevent the developing of substantial positive or negative anisotropy . for model 
 w5235 the cluster is not initially very strongly concentrated , so the mass loss due to stellar evolution and consequently by tidal stripping prevents the development of positive anisotropy in the outer and middle parts of the system ( see figure 5 ) . from the very beginning 
 anisotropy for these regions becomes negative . 
 stars , which are preferentially on radial orbits , escape leaving mainly stars on tangential orbits . 
 finally , just before cluster disruption , the anisotropy in the whole system becomes slightly positive . at that time of cluster evolution most stars have radial orbits . 
 clusters concentrated stronger ( w7235 ) , develop from the very beginning a small positive anisotropy in the outer and middle parts of the system ( see figure 6 ) . 
 in the course of evolution the amount of anisotropy in the outer parts of the system is reduced substantially by tidal stripping , as stars on radial orbits escape preferentially . as tidal stripping exposes deeper and deeper parts of the system , the anisotropy ( for large lagrangian radii ) gradually decreases and eventually becomes negative . at the same time the anisotropy in the middle and inner parts of the system stays close to zero . 
 it is interesting to note that for clusters which undergo core collapse ( w5235 and w7235 ) the anisotropy in the inner parts of the system becomes slightly positive just around the collapse time . 
 this behaviour can be attributed to the binary activities , which are mainly concentrated in the cluster core . 
 interactions between binaries and field stars ( relaxation and energy generation ) put stars on more radial orbits . 
 the anisotropy of main  sequence stars shows very similar behaviour to that discussed above . 
 mass segregation forces white dwarfs and neutron stars ( most massive stars ) to preferentially occupy the inner parts of the system . 
 therefore the anisotropy for them is much more modest than for the main  sequence stars , and stays close to zero . 
 anisotropy evolution agrees very well with the results of paper ii and qualitatively with the results obtained by takahashi ( 1997 ) and takahashi & lee ( 2000 ) . 
 three main effects may be expected to govern the evolution of the mass function in models studied in this paper . 
 first , there is a period of violent mass loss due to sellar evolution of the most massive stars . 
 it takes place mainly during the first few hundred million years and its amplitude strongly depends on the slope of the mass function . 
 secondly , there is the process of rapid mass segregation , caused by two 
 body distant encounters ( relaxation ) . 
 it takes place mainly during core collapse and is relatively unaffected by the presence of a tidal field . 
 thirdly , there is the effect of the tidal field itself , which becomes more important after core collapse or even earlier ( for models with a shallow mass function and with low concentration ) . because the tides preferentially remove stars from the outer parts of the system , which are mainly populated by low 
 mass stars ( mass segregation ) , one can expect that the mean mass should increase as evolution proceeds , making allowance for stellar evolution . 
 the basic results are illustrated in figure 7 for the total mean mass inside the @xmath86 and @xmath87 lagrangian radii and the tidal radius , and in figure 8 for the mean mass of main  sequence stars and white dwarfs inside @xmath86 lagrangian radius for model w5235 . 
 the violent and strong mass loss due to stellar evolution is characterized by an initial decrease of the mean mass . 
 the evolution of the most massive stars will remove a substantial amount of mass from the system and , consequently , greatly lower the mean mass in the whole system . 
 this behaviour is visible also in the other models , but with one exception . 
 the mean mass inside the @xmath86 lagrangian radius for model w7235 is increasing instead of decreasing . for this model , the initial concentration is high enough to force very quick mass segregation in the central part of the system . 
 the most massive main sequence stars ( not evolved yet ) : white dwarfs and neutron stars , sink into the center . for model w3235 for most of the time 
 the mean mass stays nearly constant for the whole system . just before the cluster dissolution it substantially increases . 
 for all models tidal stripping connected mainly with removal of less massive stars forces the mean mass in the middle and outer parts of the system to steadily increase . 
 the much faster increase of the mean mass inside the @xmath86 lagrangian radius ( mass segregation ) than in the outer lagrangian radii ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) during the collapse phase nearly stops at the core bounce time . 
 the subsequent evolution is characterized by the slower rate of increase of the mean mass ( close to the time of the core bounce the mean mass is practically constant ) . 
 this is in good agreement with results obtained by giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) for small @xmath0body simulations and for monte carlo simulations presented in paper ii . 
 the reason for the nearly constant mean mass is unclear . 
 the slow increase of the mean mass can be attributed to the binary activity , which leads to removal of some low mass stars from the core . 
 for all models the effect of tides manifests itself by a gradual increase of the mean mass in the halo . 
 the evolution of the mean mass for main  sequence stars and white dwarfs for the inner @xmath86 lagrangian radii is shown on figure 8 . 
 when less and less massive main  sequence stars finish their evolution as less and less massive white dwarfs , the mean mass of white dwarfs decreases with time . 
 the newly created less massive white dwarfs affect the mean mass of white dwarfs more strongly for the steeper mass function than for the shallower one . 
 for the steeper mass function a smaller number of massive white dwarfs is created comparable to the shallower mass function . at the time around the core 
 bounce the average mass of white dwarfs increases . 
 this is connected with the decreasing core size and continuing mass segregation . 
 deeper in the cluster center a higher fraction of massive white dwarfs is present . in the post collapse 
 phase the white dwarfs average mass is decreasing . 
 binaries start to be created mainly from the most massive stars ( neutron stars and white dwarfs ) deep in the core . 
 they dynamically interact with other stars and in the course of evolution are removed from the system together with some massive white dwarfs . 
 this leads to the decrease of the mean mass of white dwarfs . 
 the mean mass of main  sequence stars initially slightly decreases , which is connected with stellar evolution of the most massive stars . 
 then , there is a period of the gradual increase of the mean mass due to mass segregation . at late phases of cluster evolution 
 the rate of increase of the mean mass speeds up . around the core 
 bounce time one can observe the break of the rate of increase of the main  sequence average mass . 
 this can be again attributed to binary activities . 
 the evolution of the total mean stellar mass in the different places of the system ( figure 7 ) and the evolution of the average mass inside @xmath86 lagrangian radius for main  sequence stars and white dwarfs ( figure 8) agree very well with the results obtained in paper ii . 
 stellar evolution will change a stellar content of the cluster . 
 in the course of time main  sequence stars will evolve creating first black holes , neutron stars and then white dwarfs with decreasing masses . in figure 9 , 
 evolution of the mass ratio of main  sequence stars ( @xmath89 ) , white dwarfs ( @xmath90 ) and neutron stars / black holes ( @xmath91 ) to the actual total cluster mass and the evolution of the ratio of the actual total mass ( @xmath92 ) to the initial total mass , are shown for model w5235 . the fraction of evolved stars present in the system at any time results from two processes which act in opposite directions : stellar evolution ( formation ) and evaporation across the tidal boundary ( loss ) . at the beginning of cluster evolution 
 the sharp increase of the mass ratio of evolved stars and decrease of the mass ratio of main  sequence stars and the total mass ratio are connected with the stellar evolution of the most massive stars in the system . 
 then , the steady increase of the mass ratio for @xmath90 and @xmath91 is observed . after the time of core 
 bounce the ratio for @xmath91 is slowly decreasing because of binary activities ( the most massive stars ( neutron stars ) are with the highest probability involved in binary formation and finally removed from the system by interactions with the field stars and other binaries ) . 
 the ratios for @xmath92 and @xmath89 are decreasing , as expected . at the time close to the dissolution time evolved stars consists of up to 75% of the mass of the all stars and up to 63% of the number of all stars . 
 the fraction of mass / number of @xmath90 is larger for systems with shorter relaxation time and with stronger influence of the tidal field of a parent galaxy . 
 this is in a very good agreement with the results obtained by vh . 
 figure 10 shows the evolution of the mass ratio of evolved stars to the actual total mass for different zones in the system ( see description of figure 10 ) . as expected , the mass segregation process and removal of less massive stars due to the evaporation process across the tidal boundary cause steady increase of the mass ratios . 
 for the inner part of the system ( up to about @xmath93 lagrangian radius ) , during the core collapse time the rate of increase of the mass ratio is the fastest in the system . 
 however , after the core bounce the rate becomes slowest the mass ratio is nearly constant . 
 this is connected with the fact that the mass segregation process is nearly completed at the time of core bounce ( see figure 7 and its discussion ) . 
 further increase of the mass ratio can be mainly attributed to binary activities . for parts of the system outside @xmath86 lagrangian radius 
 the behaviour of the mass ratio is opposite to that discussed earlier . during the collapse phase 
 the rate of mass ratio increase is slower than in the post collapse phase . the further out @xmath86 lagrangian radius the ratios are smaller and faster , respectively . 
 this behaviour can be attributed to the properties of the stripping process , which is more and more effective when deeper and deeper parts of the system are exposed . in between these two zones 
 ( lagrangian radius between @xmath93 and @xmath86 ) the rate of increase of mass ratio is nearly constant during the whole evolution 
 . the amount of mass in evolved stars in the core can be as high as @xmath1 and in the outer parts of the system up to @xmath94 , at the time close to the dissolution time . 
 the same qualitative behaviour is observed for other models . 
 however , for models with steeper initial mass function and for more concentrated ones the mass ratios are smaller . for initially more concentrated models 
 the time of core bounce is much shorter than for the less concentrated models . 
 so , the process of mass segregation is less advanced and therefore the mass ratios are smaller . 
 also , for more concentrated cluster the evaporation process is less effective . 
 the ratios are about @xmath86 smaller than for w5325 model . for the model w3235 , which does not enter the post  collapse evolution before the cluster dissolution 
 the mass ratios behave like for other models in the collapse phase , but the spread between ratios in different zones is much smaller . 
 it is worth to note that cluster at the time 15 gyr can consist of up to @xmath95 of evolved stars in the core and up to @xmath86 of evolved stars in the outer parts of the system . 
 this conclusion has very important observational consequences . 
 the presence of a substantial number of practically invisible stars has to be taken into account when the global globular cluster parameters are drown from the observations . 
 now lets discuss the evolution of the local ( lmf ) and global ( gmf ) mass functions in comparison to the initial mass function ( imf ) . 
 according to vh the mass slope of a mass function can be obtained from the numerical data in the following way :    @xmath96    @xmath97 is estimated by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the total number of stars between @xmath100 and @xmath101 . according to vh @xmath16 and @xmath17 
 were chosen to @xmath44 and @xmath102 , respectively . 
 the lmf were calculated for three zones ( vh ) : up to @xmath103 lagrangian radius , between @xmath103 and @xmath104 lagrangian radii and from @xmath104 lagrangian radius up to tidal radius . in the case 
 when only mass segregation is taken into account , the lmf in the inner parts of the system becomes flatter and in the outer parts becomes steeper . 
 the evaporation process acts in the opposite direction . 
 it tends to flatten the mass function because of the preferential removal from the system ( particularly from the outer parts ) of low mass stars . as it can be seen in figure 11 the theoretically predicted behaviour of lmf 
 is qualitatively represented by the numerical results . 
 for all the discussed models the lmf for the outermost parts of the system initially increases . 
 the increase is slightly higher for more concentrated systems with the same imf ( this is consistent with the picture of mass segregation ) , and even more pronounced for the system with the same concentration but with stepper mass function . 
 for all models the gmf closely resembles the lmf in the middle parts of the system . 
 the imf during dynamical cluster evolution is very quickly forgotten and practically impossible to recover from the observational data . 
 the actual gmf of globular clusters can be recovered from observational data for middle parts of the system ( close to the half  mass radius ) . 
 the results discussed above are in a very good agreement with the results obtained by vh for @xmath0body runs . 
 this paper is a continuation of paper i and ii , in which it was shown that the monte carlo method is a robust scheme to study , in an effective way , the evolution of very large @xmath0body systems . 
 the monte carlo method describes in a proper way the graininess of the gravitational field and the stochasticity of real @xmath0body systems . 
 it provides , in almost as much detail as @xmath0body simulations , information about the movement of any object in the system . in that respect 
 the monte carlo scheme can be regarded as a method which lies between direct @xmath0body and fokker 
 planck models and combines most advantages of both these methods . 
 this is the first important step in the direction of simulating the evolution of a real globular cluster . 
 it was shown that the results obtained in this paper are in qualitative agreement with these presented by cw , vh , ah , tpz , jnr , paper ii , baumgardt & makino ( 2002 ) and lamers 2005 . 
 particularly good agreement is obtained with vh s @xmath0body simulations and what is not surprising , with results of monte carlo simulations presented in paper ii . 
 all models survive the phase of rapid mass loss and then undergo core collapse and then subsequent post  collapse expansion ( except model w3235 ) in a manner similar to isolated models . the expansion phase is eventually reversed when tidal limitation becomes important . as in isolated models , 
 mass segregation substantially slows down by the end of core collapse . 
 mass loss connected with stellar evolution dominates the initial phase of cluster evolution 
 . then the rate of stellar evolution substantially slows down and escape due to tidal stripping takes over . during this phase of evolution 
 the rate of mass loss is nearly constant , and higher for shallower mass functions . 
 energy carried away by stellar evolution events dominates the energy loss due to tidal stripping , even though the tidal mass loss is higher . for the first time , because of the large number of particles in simulations ( @xmath105 ) which results in substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations , it was possible to compute in an accurate way the evolution of density profiles . 
 the development of power  low density profile is clearly visible and agrees very well with theoretical predictions . the observed power 
 low index is equal to about @xmath81 . 
 the strongly concentrated model ( w7235 ) , shows a modest initial build up of anisotropy in the outer parts of the system . as tidal 
 stripping exposes the inner parts of the system , the anisotropy gradually decreases and eventually becomes slightly negative . 
 model w5235 from the very beginning develops in the outer parts of the system negative anisotropy . 
 the cluster is not concentrated enough to prevent removal of stars which are preferentially on radial orbits . 
 the negative anisotropy stays negative until the time of cluster disruption , when it becomes slightly positive ( during cluster disruption most stars are on radial orbits ) . because of mass segregation , and due to evaporation across the tidal boundary , which preferentially removes low mass stars , the mean mass in the cluster increases with time . during the core collapse the rate of increase of the mean mass is highest in the central parts of the system ( mass segregation ) . 
 after the core bounce there is a substantial increase in the mean mass in the middle and outer parts of the system ( tidal stripping ) , and more modest increase in the inner parts of the system , which is mainly connected with binary activity . 
 the fraction of evolved stars is increasing during the cluster evolution . 
 this fraction is larger for systems with shorter relaxation time and stronger influence of the tidal field of a parent galaxy . 
 the mass ratio of evolved stars can be as high as nearly @xmath106 at the outer parts of the system up to nearly @xmath107 in the core . at the time of @xmath108 gyr these ratios are @xmath95 and @xmath86 , respectively . 
 the presence of a substantial number of practically invisible stars has very important consequences for the interpretation of observational data and it has to be taken into account when the global globular cluster parameters are drown from the observations . because of stellar evolution , mass segregation and evaporation of stars the imf is quickly forgotten and impossible to recover from the observational data . 
 the actual gmf closely resembles the lmf for the middle parts of the system ( close to half  mass radius ) . 
 these results are in an excellent agreement with @xmath0body simulations presented by vh .    in order to perform simulations of real globular clusters 
 the description of some processes , already included in the code has to be improved , and several additional physical processes have to be added to the code . stellar and binary evolution , more accurate treatment for energy generation by binaries , particularly in binary  binary interaction , and proper treatment of the escape process in the presence of a tidal field 
 are still waiting for improvement . 
 one of the population synthesis codes developed by hurley ( hurley 2000 , 2002 ) , portegies zwart ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1966 ) and belczyski ( belczyski , kalogera & bulik 2002 ) can be used to follow more accurately single star and binary evolution . 
 the implementation of techniques used in aarseth s @xmath109 codes for direct integrations of a few body subsystems can cure the problem of energy generation in 3body and 4body interactions ( giersz & spurzem 2003 ) . 
 the treatment of escapers proposed by spurzem ( 2005 ) can be implemented to solve the problem of escapers in the tidal field ( problem which is inherently connected with gaseous , fokker 
 planck and monte carlo codes ) . 
 the tidal shock heating of the cluster due to passages through the galactic disk , interaction with the bulge , shock  induced relaxation , primordial binaries , physical collisions between single stars and binaries are some of the processes , which are waiting for implementation into the code . 
 the inclusion of all these processes does not pose a fundamental theoretical challenge , but is rather complicated from the technical point of view . 
 the international collaboration called modest was setup a few years ago to solve problems with merging all available codes ( hydrodynamical , stelar evolution and dynamical ) into a code which can deal in detail with the evolution of real globular clusters ( see * http://www.manybody.org/modest * ) . 
 inclusion into the monte carlo code of as much as possible physical processes will allow to perform detailed comparison between simulations and observed properties of globular clusters , and will also help to understand the conditions of globular cluster formation and explain how peculiar objects observed in clusters can be formed . 
 these types of simulations will also help us to introduce , in a proper way , into future @xmath0body simulations all the necessary processes required to simulate the evolution of real globular clusters on a star  by 
 star basis from their birth to their death .
